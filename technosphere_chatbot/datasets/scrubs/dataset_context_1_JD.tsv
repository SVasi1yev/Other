And four years of pre-med, four years of med school, and tons of unpaid loans have made me realize one thing...	I'm the man.
I don't know jack.	Good. Could you go drop an NG tube on the patient in 234, and call the attending that the lavage is positive?
Look, I became a doctor because I wanted to help people. But orientation yesterday... it didn't really focus on patient care.	Good. We just turfed him there.
Hey, Turk.	The hospital doesn't want to be sued. Being sued is not a good thing.
You know how I'm totally down with the rap music?	'Sup.
Chris Turk's my best friend. We roomed together in college...We roomed together in med school...Hell, we even got accepted by the same hospital.	Dude, be whiter.
Here's the thing: TuPac, DMX, Dr. Dre, in most of their songs, these artists use an extremely volatile racial slur... the "N" word.	Chris Turk's my best friend. We roomed together in college...We roomed together in med school...Hell, we even got accepted by the same hospital.
Right. My question is this: if we're both singing along, and knowing that otherwise I would never use the word, am I allowed to say-	I got it.
See, that's good for me to know. I didn't-I didn't know that.	No.
Hey, listen, I found us an apartment....	Finally, doctors, if there is a mistake, don't admit it to the patient. Of course, if the patient is deceased, and you're sure, you can feel free to tell him or her... anything.
Me too. I love watching it, I love playing it, I love all of it.	I love PacMan.
I'm J.D., this is Turk.	Yeah. Don't do that.
Heh-heh. Hello.	Medical.
I know. I would have laughed if you'd paused.	So, every male in my family is a doctor: my dad, my grand-dad, and my brother. I guess that's why dad gave me a guy's name, made me play sports, date girls. I'm joking.
Your butt looks like two Pringles hugging.	Anyway, I know what you're thinking.
No you don't.	Your butt looks like two Pringles hugging.
Hey, are we, like, racing?	I'm probably "Miss Hyper Competitive". I mean, it used to be a big problem for me. "Used to" - past tense.
Please. I'm not that desperate.	Yes!
Oh, yeah.	So, you do a lot of cardio, or...?
You ever notice how quickly some people make an impression?	Elliot Reid? John Dorian? Great. One: I am your resident, Dr. Jeffrey Steadman - not "Jeff". Two: Here are your manuals. This -
Yeah.	I'm a tool. I'm a tool. I'm a tool, tool, tool, an unbelievably annoying tool.
Back to today.	Yeah. Finally, these are your beepers . From now on, they control your entire life. 'Kay? Thanks. Move it.
Why?	Aww, first day, Bambi? Carla will take care of you. Don't look at me when we're moving someone.
Hi, doctor, I'm-	We're waiting for Dr. Cox.
We'll talk later.	Place an IV for me.
Come on, you've done this to cadavers before. So this guy's alive, just poke it through his skin! Poke it through! Now!	I smell nice.
Why are you telling her?	Time's up. Carla, would you do it for him, please? I also need an A.B.G.
That's a little insensitive.	Why does this GOMER got to try and die everyday during my lunch?
Mistake.	That's a little insensitive.
What about his subconscious?	Yeah, it is.
What is euremia?	I think I'm gonna love rounds. It's like being on a gameshow.
I'd had a nurse do it. Unfortunately, I'm still afraid to touch anybody.I've been thinking a lot about Elliot....A whole lot.	That's my boy!Hey, nice, clean job on the foley catheter.
Anyway...I'm going for it.	You're off the hook if you can tell me what to look for in a euremic patient.
Infection.	Anyway...I'm going for it.
I'm sure you did.	I knew the answer!
Well, how could you not be....	I was just frazzled.
Oh, I know. Yeah.	You know with the...
You could let me take you to dinner tomorrow night.Around seven.... Or eight.	Good. But thanks. If there's anything I can ever do for you, just
Well, Tiger, I gave her an answer during rounds, and she screwed my brains out.	Daddy, why did you marry mommy?
I was worried that it could exacerbate the patient's	What the hell are you doing?Did you actually just page me to find out how much Tylenol to give to Mrs. Lendsner?
But I	It's regular-strength Tylenol! Here's what'cha do: Get her to open her mouth, take a handful, and throw it at her. Whatever sticks, that's the correct dosage.
Dr. Kelso, he's always telling me, you know, "You've gotta stay positive!"	And under no circumstances are you to compromise our "no talking" agreement.
It's just that, this isn't really what I expected... You know...Most of my patients are, uh...older and sorta checked-out, mentally.	I'm gonna go ahead and say this just as carefully as possible so I don't overstate it: Dr. Kelso is the most evil human being on the planet. And may, in fact, be Satan, himself.
It's just that, do you really think we should be talking about this in front of....	Pumpkin, that's modern medicine. Advances that keep people alive who should have died a long time ago, back when they lost what made them people.Now, your job is to stay sane enough so that when someone does come in that you actually can help, you're not so brain-dead that you can't function. For the love of God, what!?
You've been like a father to me.	Her? She's dead.Write this down, newbie: If you push around a stiff, nobody'll ask you to do anything.
And there it is.	Fair enough, you want some real advice? If they find out the nurses are doing your procedures for you, your ass'll be kicked outta here so quick, it'll make your head spin.
Probably not	I am such a stud!
And you weren't scared?	This morning, I had my hands inside of a guy's chest. I couldn't even see them! I should not be allowed to do stuff like that. Whazzup.
Hey, we never got to talk about the apartment, I wanted to	It's a little deep.
Oww!	All right, Todd, J.D.; J.D., this is my man, Todd.
And like that, I was back in high school. You see, surgical interns, they're all slice-'em-and-dice-'em. They're the jocks. Medical interns, we're trained to think about the body; diagnose, test. Medical interns, well....	Oww!
....We're the chess club.	Hey, you got a stain.
He's just scared. Talk to him.	We need to know if your gas could be harmful to others.
Look, Mr. Bursky, I heard a systolic murmur in your heart, which is most likely nothing. But if you don't let me check you out, I'm gonna worry about you all day.	He's just scared. Talk to him.
You're a good man.	Then I'll do it. For you.
Maybe there's a penny stuck in there?	The door is broke. Maybe the fifth time or so. It don't open.
I dunno.	Why a penny?
No. I was I was just making small talk.	Did you stick a penny in there?
Sir, I have no idea.	I don't know!
Fantastic.Just suck out the fluid with the giant needle.	Shut up and do it.
I think this needle's too big. I'm gonna get a nurse.	Fantastic.Just suck out the fluid with the giant needle.
Why couldn't I do that? I hated him at that moment.	Come on, man, learn by doing! Learn by doing.
Oh, you think?	Okay, uh, maybe the needle was just a little too big.
So, are you gonna are you gonna move your stuff in or what?	Nothing, ma'am, this is totally normal.
Tell him you think that's stupid. Tell him you need him.	That's why I came by. I think it's better if we both branched out a little. What do you think?
Yeah, I... I feel the same way.	Tell him you think that's stupid. Tell him you need him.
Yeah, that was pretty much my point.	Movies nowadays have too many special effects.
Don't worry about the patient, Turk was already there.... 'Learning by doing.'	Agh! You chicken!
Plus, it turns out, the guy was just sleeping; attached to a faulty monitor.	Clear!
I thought we cared about each other....	Plus, it turns out, the guy was just sleeping; attached to a faulty monitor.
Well, I'll tell you one thing, the last thing in the world I wanna do is sleep wit'cha now!	Oh please, if you didn't want to sleep with me, you'd have done the same thing.
Okay.	Do me right here.
ARGH!	See!
Our date is is totally canceled!	Right. Pass me a trach. kit.Thanks.
I heard that Turk was gonna move in with Todd. I'm surprised that high-fiving freak isn't in there with him.	Lose the clothes.
Turk practically had sex in the on-call room.	Ahhh!
Seems like a good kid.	Atta boy! Go get 'em, champ!Why are you here?
Yeah.	You're worried about being on-call tonight, aren't you.
Call you?	Look, worst case scenario, you kill somebody, and that hangs over your head the rest of your life....But that is the absolute worst case scenario. Come on, newbie, look: Just have the nurses do all the stuff you're still too chicken to do, which I assume covers just about everything, and if you have a really rough admission
Yeah.... Carla....	Ouch.
Agghh!	Hey, Champ! First night on call starts soon, huh? Gosh, you must be excited.
You bet'cha.	Agghh!
No problem, sir.	Oh! About Mrs. Pratt.... I heard you wanted to put her on the hospital's transplant list. I just thought I'd recommend keeping her on dialysis a little while longer, maybe we'll get lucky!
I'll check on you every ten minutes, Mrs. Moreno, okay?	Bambi, come on. Let's go.
Are you flirting with me?You are, aren't you!	I need to see you in Mr. Bursky's room.
Why didn't anybody page me?	He crashed. The attending thinks it was a pulmonary embolism.No way anyone could have caught it. Anyhow, you have to pronounce him.
I'll never forget that moment, the way he looked exactly the same...only completely different. The shame that all I could think about was how hard this was for me.	Could you just pronounce him so I can go home?
Time of death 0200.	I'll never forget that moment, the way he looked exactly the same...only completely different. The shame that all I could think about was how hard this was for me.
I just wanted to help people.	Time of death 0200.
Really?	Hey. I lied before, man. I'm scared every second.
Well, I think it's okay to be scared.	It's a good thing they make surgical masks, 'cause if they didn't, everyone would know that my face is like this the whole time...
He needs me?	Well, I need you to tell me that every once in a while, man.
Ask him to move in again.	Anyway, I just came to check up on you; see how you're doing.
You know, Turk, the offer still stands if you wanna....	Ask him to move in again.
And like that, I got a second wind.	A Hospital Hallway.
Ah, there he is, my safety net.	How're you holding up?
Yeah, but she's, like, a second away from total renal failure.	I saw that you're still pushing to put Mrs. Pratt on the transplant list. Bad news, though, sport: she doesn't have the insurance to cover it.
They're still in there with him, sir.	Okay..... Uh, did you ask the Bursky family for permission to do an autopsy?
Just tell him you can't see Mr. Bursky again. He'll understand.	It's a teaching hospital, son, you gotta ask.
Sir, do you do you think I could skip just this one?	Just tell him you can't see Mr. Bursky again. He'll understand.
See? Every story needs a good guy.	Why, sure, sport.
I am pretty tired!	In fact, why don't you just head on home. You look kinda tired.
Crystal clear.	Dr. Dorian, do you not realize that you're nothing but a large pair of scrubs to me? For God's sake, the only reason I carry this chart around is so I can pretend to remember your damn names! Now look, if the patient has insurance, you treat them; if they don't, you show them the door.And if somebody dies, you get the autopsy. You get it by rounds tomorrow morning, or I'll be scratching your name off my chart! Are we clear!?Answer me!!!
I don't get it, if he's the jerk, then who's the good guy?	Great, sport.
Oh God, no.	We gotta relieve the pressure in his chest. J.D., do it.
And I believed him...	Look at me. You can do this.
Chest-tube tray.	And I believed him...
...You know, kinda.	Chest-tube tray.
You can do this. You have to do this.	Come on, baby, let's go; chop-chop.
Okay, gimme the tube.I can't get it through the pleura.	J.D., cut him or lose him.
Okay, connect it, please, Carla.	Well, don't be gentle, get it in there.
No way!	Normal rhythm.
You're leaving?	Eh? It's a piece of cake.That's your patient.
Sorry. It's a very big moment for me.	G'head.That's enough.
Almost. I have one more really annoying thing I gotta do.	You're finally off?
The worst part was knowing, right then, that I could never forgive her.	If you're talking about getting the Bursky autopsy, I already called the family for you. And they said fine, and to thank you, and I'm sorry. ...They didn't say that last part, I did.
I forgive her.	The worst part was knowing, right then, that I could never forgive her.
You see, I can't survive on my own.	I forgive her.
Even now, when I finally get to go home, in the back of my head, I'll know the hospital's still here, wide awake.	I'm a dork. I'm a dork! I'm a dork. ...I'm a dork.
But what the hell. The most important thing is that I got through my first three days without looking like a complete idiot.	Bambi! Get out while you still can.
I'm the man.	But what the hell. The most important thing is that I got through my first three days without looking like a complete idiot.
How's it going?	Hospital, interior - Admissions Area.
Now, there is nothing wrong with being a janitor.	I'm 37 years old, and I'm a janitor; how do you think it's going?
Aww... be nice to Rowdy. The guy we bought him from used to keep him in a box full of old hats.	Your dog is creepy.
Just give her a chance, man.	Okay, dude, why is she here all the time?
Nooo....	Ohh... you want to hit that!
No. She's just a friend, man.	Yeah!
I think it's healthy hanging out with a girl without the ultimate goal being sex. You know?	Yeah.
What'd you tell on her, or something?	Creepy.... I had a run-in with that Nurse Carla yesterday. She forgot to check out the stats on a patient, and then she gave me attitude about it.
It would be a good point, except that Elliot puts her foot in her mouth. A lot. She can't really seem to stop.	She is.I don't remember... And why would you automatically assume it was my fault?
He's black, too. You should tease him about that.	No.But my mother is.
You might have to write that down for me.	Hey, Bambi; that blond stick you hang out with? Tell her...Que se cuide la nalguita esa, porque si no le voy a tumbar todo el tinte rubio de la cabeza.
And Dr. Cox, we've really connected.I'm kinda like his protege.	You might have to write that down for me.
Done. Copied. And Highlighted.	I need to see his chart
I dunno.	Unfortunately, Radar, I'm fresh out of gold stars. Multilobar pneumonia at 31...? How much does this guy smoke?
Oh, I don't smoke, so... zero packs.	Well, let's hear it...
Oh. I know, I was just totally kidding with you.	What tests have you ordered?
I like Will. That actually makes this harder.	He was... We're all in on it.
I ordered blood cultures, and a high-resolution CT.	I like Will. That actually makes this harder.
When you say the word "cancer", every person reacts the same way.	Cancer.
Not like that.There it is.	Excellent.
I hate showing Todd love.	It rocks... But my bedroom, that's where I really operate! Am I right? Come on, show Todd some love!
"Baby, this, here, is the V.I.P table..."	Please baby, this, here, is the V.I.P table.Why don't you sit your fine self down?
Maybe he's a little interested.	Yeah? Then maybe the Todd'll show that little biscuit some love!
Wait, Turk.	Wow. Thank you so much for your help. You know what? Why don't you be just a little bit more paranoid.
Right, it's just, you know, he's headed down such a bad road, I thought you and I could talk to him....	I'd open with that.
When you really lock in with a mentor, you start to understand the meaning behind their words.	Right, it's just, you know, he's headed down such a bad road, I thought you and I could talk to him....
Means, "Great idea!"	You do whatever you want.
Means, "You're really coming along as a doctor."	I'm, um, I'm just happy you haven't messed up yet today.
Means, Don't ever touch him.	Don't. Ever. Touch me.
Just thought it was a nice moment.	Means, Don't ever touch him.
Ahhh, the comfortable silences.	No, you shouldn't have.
Okay, good!	But thank you for apologizing.
No, see, nothing needs to be clear.	I I just want to make one thing clear.
Uh, Will, it's important you realize this isn't great news.	Woo! Who rules? Will rules!
Yeah, well, Will, you're on a slippery slope, man.	Are you sure? 'Cause, that's how it first hit me.
I had to scare him, but I had the sense he'd heard it all before. Luckily, part of being a doctor is your ability to improvise.	Yeah, well, Will, you're on a slippery slope, man.
So, right now, the one thing that I want you to think about......How would you like to sound like this?	I had to scare him, but I had the sense he'd heard it all before. Luckily, part of being a doctor is your ability to improvise.
No, it's not.	Let me see.This is so cool!
It's not a toy.Would you like to play a game?	Bwiddy-bwiddy-bwiddy. Okay, doc.
Sometimes, if all you have is old words, all you can do is put them together and hope they say something new.	It's not a toy.Would you like to play a game?
Look, man, you're a great patient. I like you enough to hope I never see you again. But, I promise you, if you keep smoking, you'll be back here. I bet my own life on that.	Sometimes, if all you have is old words, all you can do is put them together and hope they say something new.
Will, the pneumonia patient, I got him to quit smoking.	I heard "I know I'm being annoying," and then...white noise.
Yuh-huh!	Forever?
Done forever. He swore to me. I just, I reached him! I reached him.	No "last one"? 'Cause the last ones are better than sex, trust me, I've had about a thousand of them.
Right, so with Will....	Not now. I have a ten-minute break, and my soap is on.Hey, uh, skeetch, if you do go ahead and change the channels, I swear I'll suture your hands together.
Time for a bold move.	Oh, this woman is just fantastic. I mean, the breasts are probably fake, but, by God, those tears are real!
I need to know how we're going to fix this thing with Will.	Time for a bold move.
Excuse me?	Do you know what you've just done? You just lost all lap-dog privileges.
I'm not your lap-dog.	No more walkies, no more treats, no more following me around the hospital.
But I was thinking that	That's right. You now have five seconds to get out of this room, otherwise I'm gonna start whacking you on the nose with this.Don't laugh. This isn't a joke, newbie. Get. Out.
Rowdy, no!So, I still can't figure out why Dr. Cox tore me a new one today.	I like her freckles!Geez!!!
Well, who really knows him? I mean, who does he hang out with here?	He's just Dr. Cox.He's always like that.
That must be lonely.	No one.
I'd go with the "god-complex".But it's hard to choose, you know, they're all so good.	Well, you're a surgeon. So, you've got the god-complex, the cockiness, the whole "married to the job" thing. You're cute, but you're very, very aware of it. You have no idea what I'm like, so all of your feelings for me are coming from down there. But most of all, I'm looking for the real thing; and you're nothing but a little boy who's not used to being told "No." So there's a bunch of reasons. Pick your favorite.
I know that watching Will slowly kill himself hurts you, too. That's even harder if you don't have anyone to talk about it with. So, when I got off work, I figured you know I was gonna pick up a few cold ones, right, and then maybe you and I, we'll we'll talk it out, we'll just break the whole thing down. Right? What do you say to that?	J.D., in casual clothes, with a 6-pack in hand, approaching the door of an apartment. He rings the bell. The door opens to reveal Dr. Cox. The sounds of a televised sporting event can be heard from inside the apartment.
Oh, you can't leave a place with this much warmth. I especially love the shelf filled with personal photos of your friends and family.	I don't care.Now, can I count on you to never drop by here ever again, or should I just go ahead and move?
Okay, if he comes at you, just try and roll out the door.	A very sterile-looking glass shelf with several "blank" pieces of modern art.
It's not.	Well, actually, you have a point. I guess watching the game by yourself with a scotch isn't, really, the only way to watch a game, huh. I don't know. I just, I've always thought of needing people as a sign of weakness.
Of course I will.	Then, would you stay... and watch the game with me? Maybe have a slice of pizza?
Well, thanks for the pick-me-up!	You were gonna, what, rescue me from loneliness with a three-dollar six-pack of light beer? It turns out, you can't save people from themselves, newbie. We just treat 'em. You treat that kid with a respiratory problem, and when he comes back with cancer, go ahead and treat that, too.
I think the one thing we never stop looking for is acceptance.	Wow. Great! Hey, you know what else would be really helpful...
Acceptance of our own shortcomings...	You're welcome.
...Acceptance that some things are gonna be what they're gonna be.	What baby?
Yeah... he's new here.	This is a strange resort, man. I mean, this wheelchair service is great, but that suite I rented... there's another person in it. And for some reason, the bellhop gave me an enema.
You know it all, man.	So... anything you wanna say?
Still, I hated Will a little.......'Cause, thanks to him, I started to look at all the people who were important to me in terms of what will probably kill them.Heart Disease...Liver disease...Somebody choking her...I dunno... Probably stress.	You know it all, man.
Nope.	Say anything else to him?
Yeah, but you told me not	But you wanted to.
It's the closest thing I've had to a date, recently.	Our shifts keep overlapping on Friday nights.
Oh, yeah, me too. So... can I page you?	Well, I had a great time tonight.
Oh, baby, I don't play by the rules.	You better. And don't do the whole two-day waiting thing.
Wait a second, is she joking? 'Cause if she's joking and I kiss her...Of course, if she's not joking...	Well, uh, goodnight....
Yes!	Come on, I don't do this for all the doctors.
In my experience, when two friends miss an opportunity like this, you've got exactly forty-eight hours to get the kiss....Otherwise, one of you is gonna over-think it okay, she's gonna over-think it and then you end up permanently stuck in "The Friend Zone."	Oh, and his TV is broken, so, when you two do start tagging each other , least you can do is wake him up and let him watch.
I'm just a little lonely, you know; I guess 'cause I haven't really been hanging out with Turk since he's been dating Carla.	That song... is like a virus!
Ahhh. So, surgery went okay?	Means he's gonna go eat.
We should go out and celebrate, you know, tear it up like we used to do; just the two of us.	Yeah, it was cool; it was cool.Dude, I got to close for the first time, ever. Ever! The human body is so disgusting!Oh, not yours. Yours is stunning!
That's what... we used to tear it up...We should probably never do that again.	And that would come before Part B...
A combination of steroids and any of several anti-histamines.	Well done... sport. And what treatment would you recommend, uh, Dr... uh, Dorian.
I could kinda see what was going on in Elliot's head.	'Sweetheart'?
"Fletch".	What do you wanna watch?
Maybe next time, her mom could come.	I'm so lucky I found you.
Whatever, I don't care.	Dude, you won't even know she's here. Well, except, she laughs at stupid stuff sometimes, and that kinda makes me laugh It's stup because it's so stupiOh, come on, tonight's still about us.
Well, I know relationships change, I just thought yours and mine never would.	Look, man, I'm surgery, and you're Medicine. This isn't college anymore; things have to change.
Well, we always look out for each other.... I guess I just don't feel like you have my back anymore.	What's goin' on with you, man?
Yeah, I do.Sure	You really feel that way?
If he's septic, there's a chance they'll have to reopen this guy. 'Course, there's also a chance he could die.	Well, we won't know anything until the lab gets his blood-work back.
Noo. No. I know the guy that closed, he'd never be that careless.	I've seen this before. Gauze, sponges some young surgeon left something in this man.
I've never seen that before.	'Kay, uh... Excuse me, sorry; has anyone seen my keys? No? Okay, how about my wallet? Anyone?
Don't move.No, no, no, no. Don't...move.Have you seen Turk?	Hey...I was just dreaming about you....You were.... We were.... Hey; you got a few minutes?
Turk?	Yeah. I saw him. He just went out that door.
No, no, I gotta talk to you.	Hey! Come here!
Look. it's very important that I talk to you, man.	Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Look, it's 9-up. okay? We just lost our fourth, it's your ball.
And there it was, everything was more important than me now.	Let's play, let's play.
Suddenly, I was so fed up, I decided to teach Turk and Todd a lesson right there on the court.......You know, once I warmed up a little.	Don't bring in the same weak-ass crap the last kid did!
Okay, I was looking at Bidwell...	J.D., I'ma show you what the deal's oh, oh, oh, ohh...All right, that's game. What's so important?
Go get your grub on.	I thought you sucked.
Have you seen Mr. Bidwell's blood work?	"....Oh, baby refrain from breaking my heart. I'm so in love with "
Okay.... Have you seen Turk?	Um... no, it hasn't come back yet.
Well, I'm sure you'll end up seeing him before I do, so....	Not since this morning.
What if I am?	Bambi? Are you giving me attitude?
Okay, I'm gonna leave now.	Sweetie, you have to be a minority sidekick in a bad movie to pull that off. You know what I'm talking about, right?Explain it to this man, please.First, you do the head, then you do the finger, then you talk through the nose......And then you give a lot of attitude. That's how it works. But if you're not from there, you don't understand, so I'm not gonna even 'axe' you
Noooo!	Oh, God, you killed somebody!
No, no; no one killed anyone.	Someone else did!
No, no, I'm not even sure there is a problem. I'm running tests, I'm doing everything that I should be doing.	...Maimed, mutilated, disfigured.... Let's not split hairs.
Why am I protecting Turk when he can't even give me five seconds of his time?	Look, if you know about something, by not reporting it you're every bit as culpable. Now, is there anything that you'd like to tell me?
Tell him.	Anything at all?
...No.	Tell him.
Fantastic.	Mm-hmm.
Negative? How could they be negative? The guy looks like death.	Oh, and the blood-work came back.
What happened?	Hi!
Oh, that's funny, because the only person who coulda given him insulin...	There's no infection. He's diabetic; so when someone gave him insulin during post-op, when he wasn't eating, he became hypoglycemic.
Uh-oh.	Oh, that's funny, because the only person who coulda given him insulin...
Me!I gave him insulin!	Uh-oh.
Twice!	Me!I gave him insulin!
Thank you so much. You totally saved my ass.	Well, he's fine, Bambi. I gave him an amp? of D-50 and he's eating, now. But you should probably give him a glass of orange juice in about an hour.
Look, Turk....	Well, it wasn't me....
I know.	Come on, man; you know I always got your back.
Just tell him how you feel without sounding like a girl, for once.	I know.
I miss you so much it hurts, sometimes.	Just tell him how you feel without sounding like a girl, for once.
Thank you.	Okay, um, you've had a rough day, so I'm gonna let that go for now.
Oh, crap!	Look, we're gonna find time to hang, man. It's just that we're both really swamped right now, and I'm hanging out with Carla a lot, I know... But tell me, if there was someone you were into, you wouldn't be doing the same thing.
You're right. Kiss me.	You don't even want to hear about the day I've had.
Well, we can wait like, three, four seconds.	What? Right now?
Not gross, pretty. Come here.	No, I just ate, I feel gross.
It never fails.	J.D., can we just... talk for a second?
Thank you.	Pretzel?
I use it all the time.Come on.	The first few weeks here have been so hard for me, mentally, physically, emotionally. It's like math camp all over again. Not that I've ever been to math camp it's just an expression.
I know the idea of choosing friendship over sex is the last thing any guy wants to hear. But you know what? This time, it actually made sense to me.	I use it all the time.Come on.
...Besides, I challenge anyone to survive as an intern without a close group of friends to lean on.	Turk and J.D.'s Apartment.
I cant believe you lost our bottle opener.	...Besides, I challenge anyone to survive as an intern without a close group of friends to lean on.
You're a bad person.	Yeah, I know.... I miss it so much, it hurts sometimes.
We've got to do something about this.	Of course you meant something by it.
Come on, Carla's your girlfriend, Elliot's my friend....	No.... We really don't.
Well, yes, frankly, I think that you're being condescending and you're being overly sensitive.'Scuse me for a second... just one second.	Mm-mm.
Nope. Not this time.	Mm-mm.
Well, yes, frankly, I think that y-you're being condescending and you're being overly sensitive.Dammit!	Nope. Not this time.
Hello? I'm the doctor!I'm...I'm...I'm the doctor.	Hi, I'm gonna be your doctor.
It's kinda too soon to tell.	Now that's enough! Now, sure, he's young, but he's probably a very good doctor. Are you a good doctor?
That'd be nice.	Honesty.... Well, I like that. You probably want these people to wait outside.
Uhh... would you guys mind....	Make 'em know you're a man, not a boy.
Everybody outta here, now!"Now!"	Do it.
Right... that's what I'm talkin' about.	Well, that was manly!
Yes, please!	Want a hard candy?
No, we had, like, this connection, you know?	"Neat"? Dude, the 1930s called and they want their lingo back.
Surgeons generally don't like to get too close to patients. Maybe it makes it harder to cut someone open... maybe it's just too risky... I dunno.	No, I don't know. Please, let me get my sweat on.
I feel like you're missing out. Like, this Mrs. Tanner, she's got this...incredible energy and...and warmth.	Surgeons generally don't like to get too close to patients. Maybe it makes it harder to cut someone open... maybe it's just too risky... I dunno.
You're using that "somebody called" joke a lot.	Dude, the League of Women Voters called and they want to know where to send your membership info.
What's his name?	I know, I can't help it. I got a hernia patient to take care of.
He must feel so safe and taken care of.	Well, his name is Hernia Patient, but we've gotten close so I like to call him "Hernia".
That's what I said!	Oh, of course! One of our frequent fliers she's a neat lady.
Why?	Nobody likes a brown-nose, son. Let me see the chart.
Yeah... I ordered them.	We'll put her on diuretics.
What's that?	These labs don't look good; I think it's time she got started on dialysis.Oh, but you know what you should do first, kiddo?
Look, I don't know how it's been with your other doctors, but when you're under my care, you stay in the hospital until I say it's okay for you to leave.	Oh, here's the party.
I don't care about food right now!	We saved you a plate.
Oh, my God, are those s'mores?	I don't care about food right now!
Couldn't you have got her a big cake?	Look, it's Samantha's fifth birthday. Now you're not gonna make me miss this, are you?
How about the ability to make quick decisions?	Nope.
How 'bout this?	Umm... Nope.
Okay, enough of this. I don't think any of you realize how serious this is. Right now we need to be worried about your mother, your grandmother... your....I'm sorry, we we haven't met, I'm Dr. Dorian.	No!
Thank you. Come on, let's go.	You're very cute.
Okay, here we go.Blow!	Candles are still lit.
So, that's basically it. Your kidneys aren't responding to the medication anymore. I'm afraid we're gonna have to start you on dialysis.	Mrs. Tanner's Room.
Yeah, unfortunately we don't really have a choice.	Oh, I'm not a big fan of dialysis.
Certain things you never expect to come out of a person's mouth.	Well, actually, I do have a choice.
No I'm not.	I think you're being a little irrational.
No they don't.	Everybody dies sometime.
But what about our duty as doctors to do everything in our power to help pe	Well, if she doesn't want dialysis, then there is no ethical dilemma.
Where, I don't see?	I win.
Pretty sneaky, Death!	Here , diagonally.
She's telling her family. There's nothing that could make me go in there right now.	Mrs. Tanner's Room
You didn't tell them, did you.	She's telling her family. There's nothing that could make me go in there right now.
Speaking of which, I took the liberty of jotting down a few things I think everybody should do at least once in their life.	It didn't come up. Look, they don't need that burden; besides, they'd just give me a bunch of reasons to change my mind.
Okay. "Number One: Eat a sausage-and-pepper hoagie from Enrico's."	Oh, no.
"Number Two: Go to Asia."	Well, of course I've done that.
I'm gonna take that as a yes, and I'll also check off "Learn a foreign language".	Gonenn kan kurai Kyoto ni sunnde imashita.
Fine. "Go to the top of the Meiffel Tower."	Done.
No, I'm not; it's right here, you can look at it!	Oh, now you're making stuff up.
You have had an amazing life.	Listen, Dr. Dorian, there's not one thing I regret as I lay here right now. I'm ready. I really am.
Me? No, no, I've I've been off for two hours.	Good, then we agree. Now, aren't there other patients you need to be seeing?
I will.	So, with your precious free time, you've been sitting in a hospital room talking to an old lady. What about your list? How many of those things have you done? For that matter, how many times have you sat in the grass and done nothing, hm?You need to start taking some time for yourself, young man. Promise me you'll do that.
Yeah, well, let me I just want to check out a few things before I...get going.Uh-huh.... Uhh-huh....	Good. Now, get outta here. Go on.
I'm scared.	Are you okay?
And on days like that, I guess the best you can hope for is that you took something from it.	A Semi-Private Patient's room another day.
...Anything....	Hey, I'm Turk.
...Anything at all....	The Hallway
....Even if it's just taking the time to lie in the grass and think about all the things you still have left to do.	The Park
Okay, uh, Louie, we're gonna go with "boobs".	Okay, Guys, we need an answer.Name one thing guys wanna see more than anything in the whole, wide world.
You're cute.	I wanna see 'em on a real girl. A cute girl.
Oh, no, I have a	What's your point? Ammonia too strong?
Dr. Steadman. Resident, and first-class teacher's pet.	This better be good paging the Chief of Medicine.
I, uh.... Sir, I was going over Mr. Martinez's chart, and it seems like the TIPS procedure he's scheduled for is completely unnecessary.	Dr. Steadman. Resident, and first-class teacher's pet.
Well, he's dead.	Why would you think that's unnecessary?
Dorian. You see me every day. Say my name; say it!	Well, excellent catch Dr..... uh... Dr.... uhm....
That was the name of the patient, sir.	....Martinez.
No, actually, that's the that's the manufacturer of the clipboard...sir.	...Avery.
I hear that!	Fine work doctor! Fine work.
I think you should go ahead and do it.	Oh, I'm sure he's just shy.
Why not? It's easy, you just go like this.	I am not flashing my breasts!
Oh, , I went by Pediatrics..... They thought it was funny.	Ooh, that's hot.
Ahhhhhh! My man, Turk, is getting it daily, nightly, and ever so rightly!Ah! What up, dude!	How was that?
Once every 4.2 seconds a man says something stupid that a woman hears and punishes him for....Luckily, this wasn't one of those times.	Ahhhhhh! My man, Turk, is getting it daily, nightly, and ever so rightly!Ah! What up, dude!
"What up...dude?"	What did you just say?
No, just 'cause you guys have been dating...for a while. Do Latina women put out more? Because that's not something I've I've ever heard.Turk told me.	Why would you think that Turk and I slept together? Because I'm a nurse? Because I'm Latina?
So, anyway, I think you should let the kid meet the ladies.	...Show me that you know me.
Well, I'm new here, but I'm relatively certain that invasive vascular procedures have a very low success rate on dead people.	What in the name of 'Are ya there, God, it's me Margaret' were you thinking.
You don't have to be, like, mean about it.	That TIPS procedure was for Mrs. Blitt down in 103. You see, she doesn't have insurance; Mr. Martinez, on the other hand, had great insurance. Should I talk slower or go get a nurse who speaks fluent moron?
Don't say it!	Well, geez, newbie, just what in the hell do you want from me, huh?I don't know if they taught you this in the land of fairies and puppy-dog tails, where you obviously, if not grew up then at least spent most of your summers, but you're in the real world now. Nnnnn-kay?
I still think I was right.	Don't say it!
Once every 6.3 seconds, a man says something stupid that another man hears and punishes him for...Luckily, this wasn't	I still think I was right.
Oh, no.	That's it!
I don't need Dr. Cox. Big jerk. I hate him.	The Hallway of the Unit
Just look at my badge!	So I hear. Well, anyway, I'm very proud of you, Dr... uhmmmmmm......
Oh, no, this this is my roommate's badge, sir; we must have switched this morning. We were b	Dr. Turk!
That'd be terrific, sir!	In a moment. If you will promise to go easy on the stories, I'd love for you to join me for a round of golf tomorrow.
Well, maybe that's the problem, maybe you're just approaching things too clinically.	Please, it's been done to death.I don't get it; I've done everything by the book.
Have you ever tried treating your patients with something other than traditional medicine?	Mmm! With rich, cliché centers?
Look, all I'm saying is, there's more to healing than what's in the books. I talk to my patients, I I sing to them......Ask them what their hobbies are; and tell them ghost stories about an old sea captain.	Now all I gotta do is find time to get outta here and maybe I'll buy her one.
Look at that. And all it took was a visit from The Rock.	Wow! Look at that white blood cell count!
Every time I think something, the opposite happens.... I am so not having sex this weekend.	Yeah, sure.
Look at him, pretending like yesterday never happened. Well, if he thinks I'm gonna forgive him without so much as a	Really, when did he give it to you?
I accept!	Anyway, newbie, the reason I was all bent outta shape yesterday
Is it really that bad?	Don't interrupt me. Come here;Pull that curtain. Mrs. Blitt over there needs the TIPS procedure, no insurance? Yeah, well, she can now look forward to a lifetime of encephalopathy and jaundice thanks to Bottom-Line Bob.
Totally.	I...hate...Robert Kelso. I hate his family, I hate his friends, I hate the guy that cleans his vaguely racist little lawn jockey; in fact, I hate anybody who ever even associates with him. Is that clear?
Okay, relax, it's just a friendly game of golf with a couple of guys from work.	A tee or some tea, sir? because I brought both.
Ignore him. Just let your game do all the talking.	For the record, no, I'm not a hypocrite for being here. What's your pathetic excuse, you whiny, little suck-up.
It's just a technicality.	You're fine.Today's the day I finally beat his uppity, insubordinate Eh! Great shot, doctor! You see, son, I always say, "Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer." You believe him? You're away and yet he hit first.
Argh!ARGH!	It's about what's best for the hospital.
That's true.	Dude, at least you didn't give your girlfriend a gift that used to be inside of someone.
How many has she had?	I have magic breasts.
You're right.	Almost one. You know what, Cox doesn't need your help taking her down for a TIPS procedure. As a matter of fact, he shouldn't even be putting you in that situation!
Hell no!	Hell, yeah, I'm right! Screw Cox! ....I mean, you're not afraid of him, are you?
....Okay, maybe a little.	The Hospital Hallway
That's three!	That's four.
Unfortunately, that was the moment I realized how Dr. Kelso truly saw these people.	Mm-hmm.
You know that's not even a real disease?	Well, I'm afraid I have just an awful case of the 'gotta see 'ems.'
Oh, come on. Yes, exposing yourself to a dead guy might have been a tad unorthodox; and yes, it might be a little hard to live down....	At what point did I become a crazy person?
So is everyone else around here.Oh, that's not funny.	I'm waiting for the "but."
Come on. When I look at you, I look at a doctor who'll do whatever it takes to help a patient.	Thanks. Glad I shared.
Yeah, really.	Really?
And...on that note....	Yeah, really.
I just want you to know, if you still want my help, I'm on board.	The Admissions Area
So it was all a test.	What, are you kidding? It's way too big of a risk for a peon. Okay I just wanted to see what team you were playing for.
I know it sounds melodramatic, but in my mind, as I watched the two of them, they weren't battling for patients or insurance... they were battling for my soul.	I I'm arrogant?
It's an old story, really good versus bad, right versus wrong... the Dark Side versus The Light...	I've got you this time, Cox. I can taste it!
NO!!!	I hope you learn from this.
Actually, sir, I'm not really that in to golf.	You're suspended! Effective immediately.Well, sport, it looks like a permanent spot just opened up on the golf course. How does joining the Chief of Medicine for a weekly round sound?
I think I liked it better when he didn't know my name.	Well, I guess that's your choice, isn't it... Dr. Dorian.
Owww.	That's one for me.
I'm hurt.	That's two.
It was weird knowing that my mentor could be fired by this time tomorrow. But there's no reason to feel any less confident; I'll be fine without a safety net.	Dr. Cox, if you need to talk
That can't be true. I hate that expression.	I'm assigning you to a very important board member whose family built this hospital with their bare hands.
What happened?	But for hypertrophic cardio-myopathy.
So this board member almost fainted? I'll fire up the paddles.	Pre-syncope.
Sir, I'm confused.	Ah! Dr. Wisenheimer's back; how was your ski trip?
Oh, now I get it.	You annoy me.
Oh, great, an eighty-year-old, grouchy, pretentious	But you have this nauseating charm everyone else around here seems to respond to. Use it, okay, sport?
I'm so sorry.	That would be my father. He died.
Oh. I woulda said sorry back then, but I had a little trouble with my S's....I was five.... S's.... So... uh... how are you feeling?	...Twenty years ago.
J.D.	Great. That's why I'm here. Listen, R.J.
How sweet.	Like it matters. Look, you seem like a nice, spineless little boy, so let's be honest. I'm here because it was the only way to end my beast of a mother's nagging, pseudo-concern.
Okay, well let me just check out	So, do your little tests; but first, close the blinds, wash off whatever eighth-grade dance cologne you're wearing so we don't add nausea to my symptoms, and I'll need lemon wedges for my sparkling water which, for some reason, you have yet to get me.
Nice to meet you.	Doing things I want first, your little tests later.
I hate you.	Nice to meet you.
Oh, no, I just... I-I like your shirt. Wh-what-what kind of shirt is that?	What are you looking at?
I knew it! Heh.	It's a white t-shirt.
"What kind of shirt is that." I am-I am such an idiot!	I'm just in a much better place, you know? Do I look different?
Miss Sullivan? Oh, I'm I'm sorry, I didn't realize that you were in the bathroom.	Just keep moving....Refocus; think about helping Dr. Cox.
Look, I know that you're on the Board, and I have this friend well, he's not really a friend, he's more like a mentor....	It's okay, come on in.I meant, come in the room, not in here. What's the matter with you? Are you even a real doctor?
Sorry. He's a.... Wait, wait, wh-why are you dressed?	Losing interest!
That's it!	Oh, I'm going to a party. I assume my tests are normal, or else you wouldn't be chatting me up.But, gosh, Huckleberry, I sure hope we can go down to the river sometime and race frogs!
Listen, you spoiled, bossy, chore of a woman.	That's it!
You're in now, go for it.	I'm sorry, what'd you just say?
I'm the doctor, here. So put your gown back on, get back in bed, and shut the hell up.	You're in now, go for it.
Well, get used to it...missy.Uhm... I didn't mean to be such a hard-ass just now. You can totally wait until I'm gone to put your gown back on.	No one talks to me that way!
Yes, ma'am.	Take off your pants.
The beginning of any relationship is really about three things: Control...	More.
Oh, God.	The beginning of any relationship is really about three things: Control...
...Dependence...	Oh, God.
...And timing.	He was released a couple-a hours ago.
Other than that, there aren't really a whole lot of surprises.	Your mother broke her leg.
Oh, Dr. Cox, have you met	Other than that, there aren't really a whole lot of surprises.
Oh, no, no.	Hello, Jordan.
"Perry"?	Perry.
I never heard that, I'm not here, and I don't have your ex-wife's bite mark on my neck.	You never heard that.
Oh my God. I gotta get out of here. Anger like this has a way of being passed on to whoever's closest.	Ooh. That must have hurt.
Ugh!	Happy Halloween.
Okay, when dealing with a crisis, everyone knows that you go right to the source.God, the source is pretty.	Maybe that'll teach you not to spy on people during their alone time!
Miss Sullivan? Excuse me, Miss Sullivan.	Okay, when dealing with a crisis, everyone knows that you go right to the source.God, the source is pretty.
Okay... 'Jordan'Uh... I just don't think we should see each other again.	Honey, I think we're way past "Miss Sullivan".
I am so sorry.	The story of my life. Anytime I let my guard down just a little, I get hurt.
She's gonna be okay.	You know how long it's been since I connected with someone? You know, it's not fair that just because of him I don't get to spend time Boy, it's hard to keep that going! See ya, D.J., I got a date...."See each other again"...
Your ex-wife. She's the answer.	Okay, Linus, you're way too excited; I want you to get your blankie, go in a corner, and take a time-out. Non-displaced femoral fracture... Carla's mom's gonna be fine.Okay, what?
Come on, she's on the board! Deep down, I'm sure she's a reasonable person.... Not that I know her that well, or at all, or have ever been alone with her.... But I'm sure if you just	Uhhh.... Things that ruined my life. Things that took half my money. Things with sharp edges!
...Ask?	No!
I wonder if he wants me to ask her?	I'm gonna go ahead and do this just as slowly as possible so you don't misunderstand: Nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnooooooooooooooooooooooo.
Fine. I'll ask her.	I wonder if he wants me to ask her?
That's a "no".	Fine. I'll ask her.
Or, I could just ask Jimmie Walker to talk to Dr. Kelso.	This guy's gonna need 30 MAQs of KCL.
Or I could get back to the problem at hand.	Who are you?
Jordan!Look, I know you're on your way to the board meeting, and I know you don't really like me, but	Or I could get back to the problem at hand.
Oh, thanks, that's that's special. Look, I have to ask you a favor, but you have to know this is not why we slept together.	I don't dislike you I nothing you.
I think we both know that's not completely true.	Yeah, you had nothing to do with why we slept together.
Please don't do that.	Oh, please. Even though you're terrified the Good Dr. Cox'll find out, if I wanted you to go to his apartment right now and have sex with me in front of him, you would.
Then, Jordan, look into your heart and see if you can dig up some sympathy for someone who means a whole lot to me; and probably means a little to you, too.So will you help him?	You know, you remind me of him when he was younger.
He's taking it well.	YES! I am bullet-proof!
I don't know why she did it; maybe I got to her, maybe she knows how much the hospital needs him, maybe, somewhere, she remembers why she cared about him in the first place.	See you in hell.
Whatever the reason, it made me realize that every ending leads to new complications.......New problems to be dealt with.	Oh, listen here, pumpkin, if you're honestly having this much trouble getting over me, just go ahead and give me a call and I'll toss you a sympathy throw-down anytime.
...New issues.	I'm watching that.
What happened?	She was never boring.
Look, I don't think you realize how important you are to some people around here.	Eh, you marry somebody just like your mother, and then you remember you hate your mother.You asked her for help, didn't you.
I'll always remember that moment as the first "thank you" I got from Dr. Cox.	Look, I don't think you realize how important you are to some people around here.
It felt good.	Well, geez, Agnes, does the field hockey team know that you're missing?
Stick with the truth, and you can't get hurt; it's just always been my philosophy.	Although, it did take some stones to be honest.
God, no!	You didn't sleep with her, did you?
Philosophy is tricky.	God, no!
Sir, I'd say it's Beck's Triad.	Over the last few weeks, the most amazing thing has happened I've been nailing rounds. I think I'm actually starting to separate myself from the pack.
...It keeps me on top of my game...	Sir, I'd say it's Beck's Triad.
Looks like a break in the ulna, right there.	...It keeps me on top of my game...
It's good to be the king.	Looks like a break in the ulna, right there.
You know, it's it's okay to be impressed by me most girls are.	It's good to be the king.
The only problem with reaching the top is that sooner or later someone starts nipping at your heels....For me, that guy was Nick Murdoch.	You know, it's it's okay to be impressed by me most girls are.
Well, the gurney adds drama.	Wow.
Good bed-side manner, good rapport with the nurses...	No problem. Just give him Prednisone and Benadryl. I'll go...
...sees me staring at him....	Good bed-side manner, good rapport with the nurses...
Act busy!	...for a dermatology consult.
That's the...that's the stud, right there. That's where you'd...hang a painting.	Act busy!
Hey, how are you?Oh, okay. There there that is.	He was born John Dorian, but he was simply known as 'J.D.' Doctor. Friend. Lover.Hey, man, how are ya?
Yeah, I know. I still feel like I'm seven years old, playing 'MASH' with my older brother.	Gosh, can you believe we're doctors? The other night, I'm at a restaurant and this guy starts choking. They asked if anyone was a doctor, I didn't even move!
I don't wanna be HotLips again!	Yeah, I know. I still feel like I'm seven years old, playing 'MASH' with my older brother.
Shut up, and kiss Frank.	I don't wanna be HotLips again!
I don't talk to my brother much.	Shut up, and kiss Frank.
What are you doing? Don't connect with him.	I don't talk to my brother much.
Well, I'll see ya.	What are you doing? Don't connect with him.
Wait. Whatever happened to the guy in the restaurant?	Okay.
Don't laugh. Don't laugh!Damn!	Oh, eventually I remembered I was a doctor; 'course, he'd been dead for twenty minutes very embarrassing. Food was good, though.
You slut.	Yeah. Guy on the bus fell asleep on me, and drooled on my shoulder.
How about Nick?	Yeah.
Well, you could start by looking at him.	Oh... I'd let him drool on me. Oh, that's gross, why did I say that? I I shouldn't talk to people. Besides, I wouldn't know what to do even if I was interested.
It felt weird trying to push Nick on her. I mean, this morning I wanted to kill the guy; but the truth is, he's so nice, he probably would've helped me.	Did he look back, did he like me? Why doesn't he like me? I can't believe I already blew it.
Oh, my God, I'm drawing a.... Oh, my God, I can't even remember what you draw when your mind draws a...something!	Ahh, if it isn't the brain trust. Someone tell me what this patient's rash is. You have until I finish my squeezy-juice.
Then why don't you just answer it?	It's Erythema Migrans.
Please. Like he knows me.	Everyone looks up to you. It's important to them that you don't get stumped. Besides, come on, it's important to you, too.
It's, uh, Erythema Migrans, sir!	Please. Like he knows me.
Mission accomplished.	Yeah, sure, congratulations. Now...go.
No	Oh, no, no, no. I didn't know you wanted to do it. You do it.
Well I O-okay.	You'll be great.
Doesn't mean anything.	Wish my dad was alive.
So, what, you just, like, flipped a coin in your head, or...?	Doesn't mean anything.
Okay, go, you know, insult me like you always do.	No. It's just that, right now, he's better at internal medicine than you are.
I think everyone's finally coming around to my way of thinking about Nick.	No problem. Just give him Zofran and a 20 C.C. per kilo bolus of normal saline.
Who cares? Everybody's got a cute butt; _I_ have a cute butt.	Oh, it's almost like it's been sculpted.
How you like me now, Nick? Uh-oh.	Son, I'm more proud of you than I've ever been of an intern.
Paging Dr. Martyr. I mean what the hell was that guy	Well, then. You have just won the privilege of writing my next ten lectures by...this afternoon.
....Thinking.	Nick? That was amazing.
It's good to be the king.	....Thinking.
The hospital starts to seem like a whole different place.	What can I say? The lectures this kid wrote for me were fantastic!
Hey, man. Want some company?	The hospital starts to seem like a whole different place.
Well?	Nah. I just wanna be alone.
I'm'unna.... I'm'unna.... I have to.... Things.	You see, Dr. Dorian, your problem is...you're a pansy. If you were in my way, I'd throw you off this ledge right now. We're out here alone.... No one would ever know.
Oh, you got it.	Hey, good timing. Gimme a hand with this foley cath., will ya?
Whether or not Nick knew how petty and jealous and competitive I'd been, I still felt like I needed to step up, lay it out there, and apologize like a man.	Oh, you got it.
We cool?	Whether or not Nick knew how petty and jealous and competitive I'd been, I still felt like I needed to step up, lay it out there, and apologize like a man.
Besides, even if I was the star for a little while, he's the man now.	Yeah.
This belongs to you.	Besides, even if I was the star for a little while, he's the man now.
Oh, sure.	Oh, thanks a lot, man.Can you grab me some more tape?
Once you line up behind a truly strong leader, everyone picks up their game.	Oh, sure.
We began to function like a well-oiled machine.	We need to get the results of this urine sample.
Hey, Nick, I got the results back from the, uh.... Nick?	We began to function like a well-oiled machine.
Sure. You know, Elliot's not gonna let herself be overwhelmed anymore.She's been drinking!	Hey, can you help me find Dr. Murdoch? Peter's parents are here and he's not answering his page.
Nick! Touch my butt, please? ...Hey, you all right?	Hey. We were just looking for you.
The scariest thing was that I thought he was stronger than all of us. But maybe it's not about being the best. Maybe it's about finding the little things that get you through the day.Whether it's the support of someone close to you......or letting yourself feel overwhelmed...	I can't do it anymore. I I'm done...I'm done...I'm done.
...if only for a moment.Or being selfless every once in a while.I don't know.I guess, in the end, it's about surviving......any way you can.	Okay....
Whoa!	See you tomorrow.
That's it?	You're stupid.
Am I stupid?	Give it time, it'll eat at ya.
Damn him!	Yeah, little bit.
Let's get outta here before we end up on the 6 o'clock news.	Oh, don't even think about it that way. This is just a nice place to buy a burger that's a short, convenient two-and-a-half-mile walk away from the hospital.
I'm worried about the kids.	No! ...We're here protesting.
Oh, this is just, um, it's thirty-eight dollars in singles....I-I bought a newspaper, and this is the change from my forty.	So what's that in your pocket?
Sir!No pulse.	Neil!
Call an ambulance!	Starting CPR.
Holy inferiority complex, Batman! How low is my self-esteem that I'm the sidekick in my own fantasy!?	Dr. Dorian! Dr. Turk!
Damn you...sir.	It could be worse, Robin. You could be Alfred, the Butler.
Life in a hospital moves so fast. One second you're a hero, the next, you're obsessing about intern evaluations.	Damn you...sir.
Really, what'd you get?	Who cares? It's only a grade.
It's a proud day for women everywhere.	An A-plus. But, then I turned on the water-works and the resident changed it to an A-plus-plus.
Somehow, I doubt it.	Listen, Super Girl: I'm gonna break you down into so many little pieces that my grandmother, who can do a thousand-piece puzzle of clear-blue sky in less than an hour, will never be able to finish putting you back together again. Even if she does go back in time to when her vision was perfect.
Outraged and disgusted.	I'm sticking with we were protesting....J.D.?
Okay. Who hasn't bought us drinks, yet?It could happen!	You should take Bambi out tonight; maybe with all the hype, you can finally get him a girl.
Oh, man; this is so uncomfortable. She's not gonna get the invite.Just hold your breath until it's over.	I'm just...having dinner with a friend.
You could take Elliot with you?	Oh, man; this is so uncomfortable. She's not gonna get the invite.Just hold your breath until it's over.
Have a good time tonight!	Great. I can't wait.
No.	No, why? Did you take something?
Nothing.	What'd you take?
Now that I think about it, I'm psyched to have Dr. Cox do my evaluation. It'll give me a chance to finally see what he truly thinks of me.	Newbie! Come!
You didn't even fill out my name.	Look, Doogie, I'm up to my cha-chas in busy work, so I'm gonna go ahead and take a rain-check on your report card just have you do it yourself.
Well, sir, these evaluations...	Dr. Dorian, how are you?
Okay, whose breasts haven't I signed yet?It could happen!	It's just a pleasantry, sport; let's keep it moving. Listen, I've been thinking, with all the publicity you and your friend have been getting, it would be silly not to milk it a little bit see if we can't promote the hospital. What do you say?
Anything for the hospital, sir!	Excuse me?
I dunno whether to be easy or hard on myself. I mean, either way	I describe you as: I'm on my lunch.
Dr. Cox? Have you been here the whole time?	Can't you see I'm watching my stories?
But I thought you said you were too busy to do my evaluation?	No; I just came in through the couch door. Move.
She is ta-haasty. Watch me work a little cat-and-mouse game with her.	Nothing! Okay, I'll be right back.
I am so sorry.... And I love ZZ Top.	She's married to the sound-man, bud. And that little thing that's clipped to your collar, that's a microphone.
Well, good enough that he asked me for mouth-to-mouth again!	Okay, we're rolling. So, how is my cameraman doing?
I, uh, finished my evaluation.	Oh. So you're gonna play it that way, huh? Touche.
Enjoy. I think you'll find it's a good read.	Oh, great. I thought it was gonna take you a little longer, so the marching band won't be here until this evening.
Well, yeah....	Hey, Newbie. This thing actually does matter, so tell me, were you completely honest with yourself?
I'm I'm not...gonna bark like a	Say it right into the camera, there, hotshot. Now, you can have this thing back anytime you want. You're gonna have to bark like a dog, though.
Woof!	It's your call.
No, no, no! You're going to like it!	This isn't one of those uncomfortable moments that'll change our friendship, is it?
Roll 'em up.... Roll 'em up.	Good. 'Cause I need some good news, man. Can you believe that newslady? "What's it like to be a black doctor?"I just wish this was over.Why have we stopped?
But you do love 'Sanford and Son'.... We both do.Bum-bum-bwa-dum. Bum-bum-bwa-dum-bwa-dum-bum.	Yeah, everybody assumes that I'm a good athlete, or or or that I grew up poor, or that I love 'Sanford and Son'.
That's what I'm talkin' about.	Bum-bum-bwa-dum.
So what, they put you on the cover.	Remember our college brochures?
Come on, it's different this time. Now it's both of us.You can still see my hand on your shoulder.	Twice?Ohh? Ohh!
And that's when I realized, I'm not gonna let people take advantage of me anymore.	Come on, it's different this time. Now it's both of us.You can still see my hand on your shoulder.
Look, this is so unfair, you're supposed to do my evaluation not me. And, you know what? You're gonna do it, buddy-boy.	And that's when I realized, I'm not gonna let people take advantage of me anymore.
I'm serious.	"Buddy-boy"? Why...I...oughtta....
Well, if it's that easy, then it won't take you that long to do it.	Relax, Newbie. It's just an evaluation; it should be easy.
When?	All right, well, don't you worry about it another minute, there, Newbie. I'll evaluate you, I'll evaluate the hell right outta ya.
Fine!	Oh, just the second I get off work.
Great!	Fine!
Here it is.You get off, like, six-ish, er...?	Great!
Hey, Turk. Look, I'm really sorry about the whole poster thing. It was racially insensitive of me; I should have been more aware of your feelings before I went ahead and spoke for you.	You're such a guy. You can't even begin to understand something this deep on any kind of real emotional level.
I love you, man.	It's okay; your intentions were good, and there's never been an issue of race between us. Since the day I met you, you've been nothing but a friend to me.
Keep it real!	Hit me one.
I'm cool with that.	It's time. Sit down.Now, what do you want me to say? That you're great? That you're raising the bar for interns everywhere?
I-I can't think of a safe answer. I just figured	I'm not gonna say that. You're okay. You might be better than that someday; but right now, all I see is a guy who's so worried about what everybody else thinks of him that he has no real belief in himself.I mean, did you even wonder why I told you to do your own evaluation?
It's funny how our perceptions can be so off....	Yes.
...Like, when you're searching for a place to fit in, and you don't even realize you've been there the whole time.Or how a bunch of posters can't turn you into a role model if you've already been one for years.	Anytime.
Of course, in my case, I knew exactly where I stood. And it didn't feel that good.	Hell yeah!
What, your window cleaner?	Well, look what magically found its way back home.
Now that's just bad luck.	No. Ammonia. This is window cleaner, right, uh....Why!?
Hey man how's it goin?I have no idea who you are.What up dude!	Hey! Hey! Over here man!
Hey wait a second he's dating Carla. This is not good.	Hey man how's it goin?I have no idea who you are.What up dude!
How's it goin I'm-	First of all I already told her I got a girlfriend. Second you just put your bare lips on my ear.
Mmm Jennifer.	J.D., I know. He won't stop talking about you. I'm Jennifer.
I do what I can.	Tell the nice lady.
I know two things about bars, one they're always packed the week of Thanksgiving and two put a beer in my hand and I'm Mr. Smooth.	It's on, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on!
Well, I once tripped over an I.V. and blood shot over everyone! Er uh a little got on my nose… Every damn day saving those children!	I was laughing so hard milk was coming out of my nose.
Right.	Who wants margaritas? Dude, less blood more fruity drinks.
That's the thing about Turk he hasn't changed a bit since college. He's still the same goofball who tells me how to be cooler.	Right.
Why do you say that?	Dude, this girl's pretty hot, so try not to blow it. Okay?
That sounds like a Fat Albert joke.Don't worry about it man I feel good tonight, you know what I'm saying?. Except for this stabbing pain in my side.	Because you're like a 24 hour convenience store. You never close.
Dude!	So he was up all night with a high fever, cramping and crying.
On the bright side it'll be interesting to see what it feels like to be a patient here.	Poor Bambi. Don't worry Carla will take care of you. Make sure he gets admitted right away.
You're a good friend.	You know people die here?
Not right away.	Eh! Eck!
Whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah. You're examining me? I don't want you to see my unmentionables.	Alright, showtime. Clear out so I can check em out.
Actually I use the word unmentionables for my genitals as well.	I've seen underwear before.
No, no, is it a problem if it whistles?	Shortness of breath, dizziness, problems urinating?
Oh it's active.	Oh, you're making this so much easier! Are you sexually active?
Cold hands.	I'll write, rare dry spell in the margin. Okay time for the physical
Ow!	Elliot's exam was frighteningly reminiscent of when my older brother used to beat the crap out of me.
I'm still puking every hour and my fever's pretty high but you're sure it's okay for me to be out of bed right?	See that wasn't so bad. All done.
What annoying thing?	I don't know Dr. Benson was kind of my mentor, so don't do that annoying thing.
Come on that's a little-	You know when you talk.
He can say what he wants. The bottom line is he's showing me off.Watching Dr. Cox I realized we never really stop craving the attention of people we look up to.	See there it is. How does that not drive you crazy?I know you're all excited because got the gown on but under no circumstance are you to curtsy.
He seemed nice.	Any questions? Great.
You know I'm hearing it now it is kind of annoying when I talk.	Careful newbie.
I guess in a lot of relationships you regress to the person you were when you first met.	You know I'm hearing it now it is kind of annoying when I talk.
Dude she violated me.	So Elliot's uh exam was that bad ay?
Not everyone, just the people that work here. Oh and my parents.	I heard you're telling everyone I violated you.
So there it is a classic trap. Two choices, either wuss out or tell the truth.	Was there something wrong with my exam?
Well, you're kinda rough, yeah you're rough. And you're a little business like. Oh and you're cold.	So there it is a classic trap. Two choices, either wuss out or tell the truth.
Yeah, those too. I just think you know you could be more comforting.	Mm hm you mean my hands?
I could tell she appreciated how hard it was for me to say that.	Yeah, those too. I just think you know you could be more comforting.
Maybe not.	Do you know how annoying you are when you talk?
Hey I was watching that!	Maybe not.
I guess I never realized how hard rounds are on the patient. It feels like you're on display.	Well, I haven't had my coffee yet so I'm finding it hard coming up with a more colorful way to say who gives a crap? Actually that wasn't half bad.Our next patient is a twenty-six year old male who has presented vomiting, abdominal cramps, and fever.
I do cardio.	Still Rodin's masterpiece makes us wonder, why didn't he spend a little less time thinking and a little more time at the gym?
Well, for starters I would've given me that news in private no matter how angry I was at me.	And how would you proceed Dr. Dorian?
I can't believe I have to spend all Thanksgiving here. Tell me that wouldn't kill you.	You better watch it Bambi you don't want a hundred pound white girl mad at you. You'll flinch every time you hear a range rover.
Do they celebrate Thanksgiving in your homeland?	Not really.
You have a Chicago? Be nice to me, I'm getting surgery.	You mean Chicago?
Yeah but who's the intern who's gonna do all the work?	Dr. Wen's the attending.
Oh good God	I get to cut you open. I get to cut you open. I get to cut you open. I get to cut you open. I get to cut you open. Uh ooh ooh. Go girl, uh uh go get it. Uh uh and go uh and down and down. Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh.
I think it's a universal feeling to wanna be there for a good friend. That's why from now on I'm gonna stop seeing Turk as my crazy frat brother.	Don't worry we're fine here.
After all he's a highly trained competent young doctor.	Mark for the incision right about here.
Sir I'd prefer it if someone other than Dr. Turk performed the surgery.	Dude! I'm about to bust a mad slizzice in your insides!
The best thing about good friends is how quickly things like this blow over.	Fair enough. Dr. Kotter will perform the procedure tomorrow morning.
You understand right?	The best thing about good friends is how quickly things like this blow over.
You want some salsa for that chip on your shoulder?	Whatever man.
What do you mean like school in July?	I can't believe you, I would never ever do something like this to you. You're like school in July.
Here's what you should do.	Look Elliot, I'm not the kind of person who likes telling people what to do but
I'm dating Turk I get it, sometimes he is a big kid. But you have to realize when it comes to work he's as capable and mature as anyone.	You have to stop thinking of your patients as strangers.
Turk's not that mature he spent all yesterday being a walrus. He had straws and stuff.	Kelso is just pushing your buttons every now and then you gotta to let something go.
You're wrong.	Kelso's not just some harmless guy pushing my buttons Carla. He's a pod person.
Wow guys thanks. Where's the food?	Hey buddy. Okay, forget about everything that's going on. We know that you're bummed out about missing Thanksgiving. So we decided to bring it to you.
Who's on call tonight?	Bambi your fever's spiking. They're worried that your appendix might burst. So we're going into surgery now.
Most doctors don't believe in the whole out of body experience thing. And I don't know if it was real or a dream but I swear I was up there watching Turk operate on me and I have to say, he's an amazing surgeon.	Dr. Turk let's get started.
Turk I was an idiot	Hey, I just need to check on your incision.
No seriously man, I want you to know if I ever need surgery again I want you inside of me.	It's okay man.
Dude she rocks.	I wanna be the one inside you.Look J.D. I get it. I mean to me you'll always be that geeky kid with the Pat Benatar T-Shirt on.
Ooh!	I just want you to know how serious I am about what I do.That's not important. You know it's still Thanksgiving for like 20 more minutes.Now you can have ginger ale and a cracker.
Get those pennies away from me!	Oh and I forgot, you're change… two pennies.
I guess what they say is true the people you work with really do become your family. Like your brother, and your sister in law, or that cousin you have funny feelings for,. and the crazy angry uncle everyone sort of hopes isn't coming this year.	Happy Thanksgiving man.
Ah uncomfortable silences and alcohol… just like Thanksgiving at home.	Nobody talk, just drink.
Their was the Nina…	Drink!
I think sarcasm works better when it's shorter.	Reading a book. About how to tell my room-mate he drives me crazy sometimes without hurting his feelings.
Yeah, see, there ya go.So, what are you doin'?	Fascinating.
Yeah; I'm okay with it.	You realize you're annoying me?
It's just a bench.	J.D., I've had such a crappy morning in this hell-hole that I decided to come out here and eat my lunch. This spot feels secluded I mean, it's so peaceful. I feel like I'm getting my spirit back.
Nice. You know, I've already eaten, but I suppose I could	Sit down, sweet thing. Sit down.
Your cupcake.This is how I get _my_ spirit back.Mmm-mmm! ...I feel _alive_ again! I feel alive again! Alive again! I feel alive....!	Okay, what's it gonna take for you to leave this second?
Okay. You know what? It's time to change this pattern.	Your cupcake.This is how I get _my_ spirit back.Mmm-mmm! ...I feel _alive_ again! I feel alive again! Alive again! I feel alive....!
Morning.	Okay. You know what? It's time to change this pattern.
Just doing a little drilling, huh?	How do you figure?
Look, I have an idea: Let's try and go the whole day without getting in each other's hair; you know, just...give each other a break...? What do you say?	Yeah.
That that's good, but you know, I already I have a nickname; it's...it's "J.D."	I'm gonna give you a nickname.
I was, but I figured I owed it to the ladies!	I thought you said you were exhausted?
It's hard for doctors and nurses to be long-term friends....	Do you ever stop giving?
You see, when you start out, the nurses know more than you. But after a few months, the training kicks in and you both feel the dynamic shift.	His O-2 set's dropping; I think he just needs respiratory treatment.
Uhhhh...actually, Carla, I think, because of the congestive heart failure, he just needs Lasix.	You see, when you start out, the nurses know more than you. But after a few months, the training kicks in and you both feel the dynamic shift.
The future of the relationship depends on how she handles that very moment.	Uhhhh...actually, Carla, I think, because of the congestive heart failure, he just needs Lasix.
Hey-hey-hey what's happenin', Rerun.	I know.
Okay, how 'bout a little of this.	What up, Raj!
Take it back.	Oh, come on, it wasn't even that good a show.
Are we still on for that, uh, Bresson exhibit?	This second.Ooh, look at the time! Gotta go it's lunch-time! See you, Baby!
You wanna come?	Oh, I'm sorry, uh...did somebody just ask out my girlfriend?
Oh. Now I see.	It's short for "Scooter Pie."I hate Scooter Pies.
You big jerk.	Oh. Now I see.
Baby, photography is for studs.	Hey, thanks again for the invite, Bambi; I love photography.
After working at a hospital for a while, you develop a sixth sense for danger.Maybe there's a mass cas. alert...maybe there's a code.......Maybe someone spent the morning with the most annoying patient in the world and needs to vent.Luckily, I was prepared.	Baby, photography is for studs.
Yes.	Did you do your pre-rounds?
Yes.	Discharge summaries?
Yes!	Pharmacy renewals?
Yes.	S.O.A.P. notes?
Yes.	Central line changes.
...Yes.	Okay, Janet. But...did you go ahead and fix your beeper so it doesn't play that annoying song every single time you get paged?
Crap.	...Yes.
Is that all you got!?!Good one!	I expect you to act like a professional around here!
Ahh, he earned it.	How you doin'?Dude; that's totally how my car was rockin' when I took this girl out last night.Am I right?
Pain.	Ahh, he earned it.
Yeah; you know what really pisses me off? Is that no one ever calls him on anything, you know?	So Cox tore into you, huh?
It's not fair. Wait, why are you eating in here?	You wanna kick and scream while you're teaching people here, that's fine. But if you _ever_ yell at my friend again over _nothing_, then I will personally wipe that scary smile off your face, put it in my purse, and keep it there until no one around here is any more scared of you than I am.
Go outside and stand up for yourself!	I'm not afraid of Kelso! I just felt like eating in here.
You know, Todd, I'm not sure, but I'm I'm gonna guess that it's your penis.	Dude. You know what else stands up for itself?
Oh, no.	It is!
Actually, sir, it's "who, who", but thank you! That that's great.	No-no, no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no, no, NO! There's no time for 'yeah...but's. I want her punted outta here in the next five minutes or you will personally be responsible for covering every missed shift during this year's flu season. Now go. Now go. Now go.Hey, you.For what it's worth, I don't care if your beeper plays "Who let the dogs out woof, woof" as many times as ya like.
'Scuse me?	Sure. Oh, and Ginger, by the way, just a real smooth move running to your mommy.
Around here you have to make big choices every day.	Man, I wish I could stay home and read sometimes, you know? But, my job, it's like, Mm! you know? And with the "Married by the Millennium" thing still hanging over my head, I go on, like, a thousand blind dates. And then there's all my friends who, like, always need something. And there's me, who's, like, never wants to let anyone down, you know, ever! You know, with so many balls in there air, sometimes it gets, uh, it gets a little overwhelming! As soon as I leave here, I know I'm going right back to that mess. Oh, my God, I'm practically crying. How pathetic is that!
To tell you the truth, most of these choices actually have nothing to do with medicine.	Well, actually, I I came down here to tell you that, uh, we're gonna keep you here for the weekend just to get some rest.
In those cases, you have to make sure that your emotions don't get the best of you.	It's so on.
Look, my name is not Bambi! Okay!? It's Dr. Dorian. And I don't I don't really need to be looked after, okay?! So loo how about I'll be the doctor, and you just...you be the nurse!	Give me that, Bambi! That's not a toy!
Good choice.	Yes, Doctor.
Look, Carla, wait.	Okay, you gotta fix this before word gets around.
She called me "Bambi" in front of everyone. My name is not Bambi!	What did you do?
Ugh!	It's Scooter!
Yeah, but	It's okay. You over-reacted.
Well, actually, I	I should have realized you can stand up for yourself.
I think I've said all I can.	Sweetie, I know you would take it back if you could; I do! We're okay, right?
Ah. Don't tell any of my patients, but neither did I.	No; actually, I never went to college.
What? No, no, that's just it's just a joke. I'm doing the whole, like, "Turn that frown upside-down...."	What, is that supposed to make me feel better or something?
Wait! You just accepted my apology. You can't take it back!	Yeah, you know what? Hold it! I don't think we're okay.
Why would you?	I don't want it.
Oh, thank goodness; 'cause I thought you were mad at me.	You know I was only gonna go to that stupid exhibit because I wanted you to think I was brainy or something. I'm so angry at myself.
Look, Carla, if it's a problem, then you, me, and Elliot and Turk, we'll get together and	I've had hundreds of interns decide that they don't need me anymore. Why should You see, this is why you can't be friends with doctors.
Carla, I do not think	I don't work with Turk! And I'm not that close to Elliot. The only problem here is _you_, okay? We're supposed to be friends. Your self-esteem is so wrapped up in what you do. You're a doctor that's all you are, that's how you define yourself. And you think that you're better than me because of it.
Okay, sometimes that's true.Carla, you're a good nurse.	Admit it. Admit it right now, or I'll never respect you again.
Please wait.	I'm a _great_ nurse; you patronizing ass.You don't even get it, do you? For nine years, I never once felt bad about myself for what I do not for one second. And then I met you.
Hey.	The Hospital
Sometimes the only way to take a really good look at yourself is through someone else's eyes. If you're lucky, you'll like what you see.	Hey.
Or you'll learn from it.If you don't like what you see, I guess all you can do is hope that you haven't burned too many bridges.	Impressive.
Hey, Carla, how many M.A.Q.s of potassium should I give this guy?	Or you'll learn from it.If you don't like what you see, I guess all you can do is hope that you haven't burned too many bridges.
From that moment on, I knew I'd be "Bambi" forever.	You know the answer to that; don't do that. But thanks, Bambi.
He's actually very talented.	See you tomorrow, Scooter.
Everyone's way? Or _your_ way? Think about it.Thank God.	Are you aware that you are in everyone's way?
Still, there are some traditions I enjoy. Like Nurse Tisdale's 9:15 cup-a coffee.	Everyone's way? Or _your_ way? Think about it.Thank God.
Oh , this thing?Who put this up!?	Ohh, I don't know, but I'm guessing it's about hmm 9:15ish?
But I've only worked here for three months.	I did. I drove around the whole city before my 5 a.m. shift just...looking for that trying to add a little cheer. You will not ruin my Christmas. Not again. Not this year.
Things could be worse, I could be with Elliot, doing my mandatory day in the free clinic.	But I've only worked here for three months.
I assume you want something.	Yeah. Quick tip, there, sports-star when you're defensive about your feminine side, it just makes you seem more girly.
Wow. I guess that means he respects me a little.	Easy; nobody likes a cranky punching bag. And yes, it's about a patient pretty good friend of mine, actually.
Huh!	Wow. I guess that means he respects me a little.
I hate him.....but not as much as moments like these. There's nothing I can do for that guy, and yet, when I go in there, the whole family's gonna look at me like I got some magical power to fix him.	Hey, Randy, Jackie, whatta ya say? This is the monkey I got to videotape the birth.
Heyyy.I'm sorry, but it's been two weeks and your son shows no neurological improvement.	Hey, everybody!
Oh, you're ridiculous.	It was a miracle! First of all, the man was damn-near dead; then he comes out!
It was not a miracle!	He was damn-near J.D., I'm telling you, it was a miracle!
I kind of envy Turk to be that sure of something, to have that faith of course, that doesn't mean I don't love busting him about it.	Yes it _was_ a miracle! Dude!
Okay; so you think _God_ was responsible for his recovery?	I kind of envy Turk to be that sure of something, to have that faith of course, that doesn't mean I don't love busting him about it.
That's fine; we all have our beliefs. I, for instance, carry around this tiny little Monopoly piece for good luck.	Mm-hmm!
Oh, excuse me, Nurse Theresa, have _you_ ever read the Bible?	He did, I heard him, Baby. Go get him.
Dude, that's just the big Christmas tree in Miller Park.	Right now.See, when they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. Matthew...2:10.
Do it again. Please?	How pathetic is that?
Oh, God, his ex-wife. The tension actually hurts. You have to break it; say something, anything!	I thought I got Randy and Jackie in the divorce.
Banana hammock!	Oh, God, his ex-wife. The tension actually hurts. You have to break it; say something, anything!
You know, I think we all know that's just not true.	Oh, please, you should've seen him when he was a new intern: "I don't want to be a doctor!"
My family.	Wrapping presents. You?
One thing about Turk: He's always been good at rallying people.	Come on, guys! All the spirit you need is right here. Can I get a Amen-a!
I don't wanna go to mass in the stupid mor Oooh, hey! Candy!	Okay, Sweetie.
I was just I was trying to, uh....	I don't wanna go to mass in the stupid mor Oooh, hey! Candy!
Childbirth has been so romanticized.... I guess because if people really knew the truth....	Oh, it's no problem.
You'll fart, pee, puke, and poop in front of ten complete strangers who'll be staring intently at your vagina which, by the way, has an eighty percent chance of tearing!	Congratulations! You're expecting! Don't worry your doctor will tell you everything you need to know.Hi, Doctor!
Still, no matter what the realities, the end result is always the same.	You do it.
Oh, look at the baby!	Still, no matter what the realities, the end result is always the same.
Well... I think that the baby, itself, would serve as proof that it was...you know...born.	So, in other words, there is no permanent historical record of the birth of my friends' baby.
Well, I was there; you know, I could certainly jot down some of my feelings and...impressions.	You don't understand what you've done. My ex-wife is probably gonna hold this over my head for so long that I doubt I'll ever see the sun again. And I like the sun, Newbie; it made me hopeful.
You know, if he was really mad at me, he would've stayed and yelled at me.	Well, I was there; you know, I could certainly jot down some of my feelings and...impressions.
At least I can go home now.	Don't kid yourself, Newbie I couldn't _be_any madder at you!Oh! Ah! Do _not_ do that again! That's a bad newbie! Oh, bad! Oh, bad!Bad!Ah! Oh! Oh! Oh! Bad newbie!
You see, maybe it's because Christmas is a hard time for people, maybe it's because too many families get together, but, statistically, Christmas Eve it's one of the worst nights of the year to be on-call.	At least I can go home now.
I can't believe I'm wearing a suit at 6:30 in the morning.	You see, maybe it's because Christmas is a hard time for people, maybe it's because too many families get together, but, statistically, Christmas Eve it's one of the worst nights of the year to be on-call.
Noted.	If you ruin this for Turk, I'll have to hurt you.
Great! Can I go back to bed?I'm kidding! Let's do it I wanna get me some of them church crackers.	I'm not going.
Merry Christmas.	Baby? What happened? Turk? Turk, come on.
Just don't say "banana hammock."	A young pregnant girl said, "What am I gonna do," and I said, "Oh, babies aren't my thing"! How could I possibly be too hard on myself?
Look, I'm sure she'll turn up.	Just don't say "banana hammock."
I never really thought of faith as important; but without his, I don't know, Turk kinda seems like he's fading away.Me, I could use a little faith. I have to tell the Wheelers I didn't tape a thing.	Yeah, that's exactly what's gonna happen: She'll definitely turn up, she'll have a healthy baby, and nothing'll ever happen to either one of 'em.
Excuse me?	You made some interesting choices with the camera, Orson you didn't want to see any faces?
We shaved the baby.	Yeah, well....
Shaved it....	You shaved the baby?
Yep; definitely. Shave and a hair-cut...two bits.	Well, it's standard procedure, what with the recent outbreak of pre-natal lice.
You're such a special friend.	Oh, yeah, I was actually just planning on doing that...never.
What's your problem, anyway?	Well, gosh, Marjorie, aren't you sassy today! Did Santa finally bring you the Y chromosome you always wanted?
Maybe Dr. Cox has pushed me too far, I don't know; whatever it was, I told on him.	Oh, I've seen 'em; they're real. And they're gross.
Plus, he didn't even go see Baby Charlie yet.	Maybe Dr. Cox has pushed me too far, I don't know; whatever it was, I told on him.
And then something amazing happened they connected. And all the hatred they had for each other was suddenly focused on me!	Plus, he didn't even go see Baby Charlie yet.
Oh, God, yes.	J.D., do you have a second?
One of the worst things about this place is how often you feel like there's no one to turn to.	I talked to a 9-1-1 operator who got a call from this young girl who was in labor, but they lost the signal. I don't know what to do.
Babies are amazing. Especially the way they bring people together.	You're okay, okay? You're gonna be okay.
I really think it's impossible to be unaffected.	Thanks.
Because a baby can stir something deep down inside you you didn't even know was there.	What up, little dawg!
They can help you find something you thought you'd lost.	Aw! Look at the baby!
So, I guess Turk was right after all: Miracles do happen.I think you just have to be willing to look for them.	I don't know I just knew!
God bless us, every one.	Merry Christmas, guys.
Really? 'Cause I felt like it was it was right?Hey, wait up!	That was so cheesy.
Crap.	What?! I didn't say anything, I didn't do anything what imaginary slight have you concocted in that paranoid little brain of yours?
Well, shouldn't there be some sort of sign that say...Oh. Look at that. Well, you should put it back down before someone slips and falls.	Crap.
Something's going down.	"Q-Tip"! 'Cause you're skinny and your head's fuzzy.
Shut up!You see, in baseball, when a pitcher's really hot no one talks to him, no one looks at him, you just stay out of his way!	No; shush, shush.
See, 'cause he's the pitcher	Because you should never, _ever_ jinx a pitcher when he has a chance to throw a perfect game! My GOD, Barbie, how do you put your bra and panties on in the morning?! All by yourself! It's...remarkable!
Put me down for two boxes of those mint thingies.	DR. DORIAN. Listen, I know you're busy, but my daughter's selling cookies.
I'm your wing man, Maverick!I was watching, uh, 'Top Gun'. Did you know that Goose is actually the guy from 'E.R.'?	Go down to Bed 18 and get me his tox-screen; and you better cross your fingers that the news is good, because if it's not I'm blaming you.And Newbie: I want you to start a drain on the purulent pericarditis in Bed 23 now that's a tricky bastard, he's tried to die five times on me already today. Keep an eye on him.
You really do have to keep an eye on things around here, 'cause just when it seems like everything's going great.......that's when the tiniest thing can throw it all out of whack.	No, I didn't! But but, please, keep talking!
A drunk clown hurt me once.	Well, that's just fine, then, kiddo. I'm not going to be able to make the board meeting today I'm going to be tied up all afternoon at Dr. Dorian's pity party. Should I bring something? Maybe I could rent you a clown.
But, sir, I	The point is that people are less likely to sue an institution if we can put a friendly face on it. You've got a friendly face.
Hello!How are ya, I'm Dr. Dorian.	By the way, this is a special phone if you don't answer it, you get to be the intern who does the physicals over at the state prison!
Nice to meet you.	Alex Hanson.
Hellooo.	Ooh, a firm handshake. I like that.
Excuse me.	Not you. Ginger, get the lead out! Come on.
Oh, so you can do movies and I can't.	It puts the lotion on the skin.
Oh, I'm sorry. The good news is you'll be done in a second.	You have no idea how loud that is in here!
Not that good a sound.	Was that a good sound?!
Well, stuck is such a literal term. It's more like, not moving.	Oh, my God! Is it stuck!?
I can't; you were knocked unconscious, you could have a serious head injury. Just be glad you're not claustrophobic.	Well, pull me the hell out of here!
I promise.Dr. Cox must have my pager on speed dial. He's completely on top of me today.	Promise you won't leave me.
That's naughty!	Oh, do you know how much I wish Dr. Cox was on top of me?
Oh, come on, you're over-reacting a little bit.	You make me so mad, I might actually scream! Every day you bitch and you bitch about how hard Dr. Cox is on you, and you don't even realize that you're his go-to guy.
Ummm.... He had me intubate and extubate Mrs. Pollard; float a Swan on Mr. Caulca; and then do two thoracenteses, a paracentesis, a radial art. line...oh, and then place a transvenous pacemaker for a complete heart-block. Why? What did you do?	What has he had you do today? Hm?
He takes it sugar, no cream.	Oh, uh....Cream. No sugar.
It's all right; I'm right here, I'm right here.	J.D.!
Whoa.... It really feels like there's something going on, here. I wonder what she looks like?	You're such a nice guy.
Why are you squeezing all my fingers?	Why am I always in your fantasies!? You got a problem, man!
I am so in.I'm right back out.	I'll tell you what I'm not doing: I'm not checking for a wedding ring....
Sure, I was probably thinking a little bit about the M.R.I. girl, but I also like to believe that, perfect game or not, giving a friend the chance to shine was just as important to me.	Watch the attitude, Gidget, or I won't let you go down to the bonfire with the other beach bunnies. Now, I wanna do a once-around to make sure that everybody's....
Sir, it's, uh, Dr. Kelso he's making me baby-sit this patient downstairs.	Sure, I was probably thinking a little bit about the M.R.I. girl, but I also like to believe that, perfect game or not, giving a friend the chance to shine was just as important to me.
Hey, Elliot, do you	Wow!
We all have important things to do.	No time!
Hey, do you know what Alex Hanson looks like?	We all have important things to do.
My heart hates uggos.	Well, why don't you look into your heart and see how it feels?
So, do you know what she looks like?	You know what, that's exactly what's wrong with you men. You're all so superficial, so afraid of what you really feel. I'm so sick of it!
Ohh.... Come on, just tell me, does she look anything like Jimmie Walker?	Yeah, I do. But I ain't telling you.
Uhh, Alex, he's gone.	It turns out I only have a mild concussion, and plus, I work here and that's
You know, you're not a bad guy if you wanna wait and see what she looks like.	Oh. So, what, uh, restaurant are you taking me to?
Ohhh....ohh....are you sure? 'Cause....okay.Ah! I gotta go. Sorry.	I'm kidding! You don't have to take me out to dinner.
What the hell is going on, here?	I just don't know what to do about Dr. Cox!
Fine, why don't you just quit, become a lesbian, and hook up with some hot model?	It's like, I say one thing, he says the other. I seriously can't take it anymore.
I don't know...I just thought it'd be hot. Elliot, he's testing you. If you ever want Cox to respect you, you can't be afraid to disagree with him.	What does that have to do with anything?
But I still do it. Get back in the game, Elliot.	You're afraid.
I've been thinking a lot lately about taking chances.	Mm...Sweetie...it happens.
...And how it's really just about overcoming your fears. Because the truth is, every time you take a big risk in your life, no matter how it ends up, you're always glad you took it.	Good girl. Up on the second floor, holy cow, there's a laundry list of stuff I want you to do....
Wait! Stop the machine!	...And how it's really just about overcoming your fears. Because the truth is, every time you take a big risk in your life, no matter how it ends up, you're always glad you took it.
Will you go out with me?	What the hell are you doing!?
It's iffy.	If I say no, will you still let me out of this thing?
So, say it.	Then I guess I have to say yes, don't I?
Huh.	Sure. I'd love to.
That night, we went out on our first date....Had our first dinner....Rented our first movie....Took our first long drive....	Yes! YES! YES!!! You _are_ hot! Smokin' hot! In your face! WOO-HOO-HOOOOO!
...Killed our first raccoon.Ever since then, every date we've been on has always ended the same way.	Look out!
Oh, it's Cox he wants me back at the hospital.	Nooo!
Yeah, that's me.	But the page is addressed to Lillian.
What a drag....	Yeah, that's me.
That was probably the wrong time to ask for a quickie.	What a drag....
It's hard to describe how scary it is when you don't know an answer at rounds.	Uhh....
But, I'm not, I was....	You mind not staring at me while I'm eating? I hate it.
Eating.	What am I doing right now?
Staring....	What are you doing?
Not really.	Okay.There. Now no one gets to eat it! Ya happy?
Hi!You know what's great about you working in the hospital?	Hey, you!
Like, even when our dates get interrupted, we can just have a date here. Yeah, like, let's say for instance you wanted to watch a movie we could just go to the conference room and watch that video on S.T.D.s. It's funny, and it makes you think!	Hm?
Well, how does a date with you end?	Look, maybe it would be good if we actually had a date that...ends.
Tonight. Dinner. Hyde's.	It can range from a kiss at the door to...all I have for breakfast is yogurt, and I'm out of bowls, so you'll have to eat off my stomach.
Kuru.	Kuru?
Yes, Kuru.	Kuru.
Hell, yeah.	Wow. I'd actually never thought of that.
I was not.	Were you aware that the only documented cases of Kuru were members of a cannibalistic tribe in eastern Papua New Guinea?
Really?	Actually, Doc, I was in New Guinea just last week.
That patient just mocked me!	Newbie, do you happen to know what a zebra is?
Dude, I'm sorry I can't talk right now. I really gotta figure this Mr. Yeager thing out.	So, last night, when I was with Carla....
Okay.	Cool. Cool.
I got it!	Let's just say my horse didn't finish the race. I mean, I'm at the filling station but my credit card gets declined. I'm on the jet ski
No, no, no. Mr. Yeager!	Good, 'cause I had no idea what I was gonna say after that one.
And then it happened: Suddenly, Dr. Kelso didn't seem as frightening.	Wrong!
In fact, nothing he did seemed to scare us.	Win some, lose some.
Not anymore.Not even the most horrible thing he could think of.	Booga-booga-booga-booga!!!
See, I noticed he had a rash on his legs, right? And then I realized he's been having jaw claudication, which led me to....	All righty. But then I'm due back at the hootenanny.
Yeah, whatever. I'm with you.	Temporal Arteritis. Of course it is. Nurse?Will you start Mr. Yeager on high-dose Solumedrol and get the surgery resident he needs a temporal artery biopsy, stat.Now, Newbie, I'm relatively certain I can handle this. You're off anyway, aren't you?
I am so on top of things tonight, it's scary.	Fair enough. Let's go treat the patient.
Hell yeah.	I am so on top of things tonight, it's scary.
"Look, J.D., we're still great," right?	Look, J.D., um
Alex dumped me.	I-I think you're a really good guy, okay, but....
She's not blind.	Aw, you mean the blind girl you've been dating?
Well, I was just so excited about what we were doing here last night, I just forgot all about our date.	Of course she's not. Okay, Newbie, how'd you drop the ball on this one? And don't tell me you cried, or I'm gonna have you banned from the men's room again.
Well, you know what? That that means a lot coming from you, Mr. Right Here With Me Two Hours After His Shift, Also...And Last Monday Night, Too...Guy.	You didn't forget. You kept looking at your watch. I saw you.I just naturally assumed that you were just afraid of missing 'Judging Amy' it never occurred to me that you were choosing work over being with that sweet little biscuit, you stupid piss-ant.
You heard me.	What?
Or not....	J.D. Hey.
You were right, I don't prioritize you over my job, but I'd like to. Look, Alex, I wanted to be a doctor for so long, I sort of forgot how to want anything else. And now I meet you and I Look, all I'm trying to say is, I'll do anything in the world if you give me a second chance.	Or not....
Okay. I'll leave you guys alone.	I'm sorry.
And that's when Dr. Cox started poking the old bear with a stick.	I didn't page you.
Maybe he felt sorry for Kelso and didn't want to take away the one thing the guy had.	Get over here. Right now!
...maybe he just hated rounds, I don't know.	How on earth are they ever going to learn anything....
But if you didn't know Dr. Cox like I did, you'd have believed his performance, too.I guess the key to a lot of things is balance. Whether it's balance of power...	...ridiculous! Now get the hell out of my I.C.U! I'm taking over!
...balance in love......or sometimes just balance.For some of us, it seems too far out of reach......too difficult to achieve.....But the important thing is just to never stop trying......especially if you like girls named Alex...and chicken salad.	Dr. Simotas, stop smiling!I hate smiling.
The air feels crisper, the sun seems brighter...even your morning breath smells good.	Mmm. Good morning.
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.	You taste like old eggs.
How so?	I love old eggs.You are so different from the guys I usually go out with.
Yeah, well, that is because I respect you.	Well, for starters......I'm still wearing pants.
Yeah. And also, this triple-knot, I couldn't get out.Argh!	Oh, yeah?
Me neither.	Hey, thanks for being so patient with me. I hope you don't think I'm a big tease. I just...I love sleeping in the same bed with you. I've never slept better, you know?
You know, in fact, I'll go ahead and say it: I hope we never have sex.	Mm.
Whatever....	What would you say...if I told you I feel ready right now.
Yeah, tonight is good, but I think now also good.	Oh, okay, then I think tonight, we should get a nice bottle of wine
Get out!	Now that's what I'm talkin' 'bout!
Oh, God! I'm so sorry! I'm sorry.	You're on my foot.
Not today.	Whoa. No, please! Step on my foot! I'm just waiting for an excuse.
Yeah.	Really? Why not?Ahh. I get it.
Thanks.	Nice pull.
What? I I am not discussing that with you!	You slept with her yet?
Listen, Jolly Green: people's personal lives are just that they're personal.	That's a no.
I'd start him on a Demerol drip and	Okay, Grace, you wanna finish?
Yeah, but he said he quit.	Mr. Barnes has been admitted for substance abuse three times in the past year.
I believe in Mr. Barnes.	Oh! The addict said he quit? Why wouldn't you tell me something like that? 'Cause, don't you see, that changes everything.
They don't.	My mom says they frame my face!
Yeah, lots of times.... Never _with_ anyone, but....	Okay.I mean, people just don't understand addiction.... Why are we in the on-call room?Ah.So, have you, uh, ever fooled around in here?
Yes, please!Oh...hey.... Hey, Elliot...um...can you come back in, like, two minutes?	Would you like to change that?
...Or, like, eighty minutes?	Hm?
What we should do is split up into teams and search every room. We'll take this one.	I just wanted to tell you the nurses just did a check of the narcotics drawer, and there's 50 Percocet missing.
Uh, Alex?	You know they're gonna go right to Mr. Barnes; I'm gonna go check on him, okay?
I just don't like it when you leave.	Hm? What?
That's a good point.	Why would you assume Mr. Barnes stole the Percocet? There's lots of people on that ward.
Also a very valid point.	Yeah, and three of them are in comas, two others can't walk, and one's a nun.
Do _not_ stoop to her level.	I am _not_ judgmental. If I were, I'd tell you your shoes are ugly.
Can we get back to the matter at hand? This is about Mr. Barnes.	It's a _frame_. Why can nobody see that!?
Oh, crap.	Yeah?
Yeah. It's just, you know, they both have a point	Smooth.
What's that?	Stick to the booty principle.
Alex.	The booty principle: Which one do you want to sleep with?
I'm not sure about Turk's advice; I mean, sometimes he oversimplifies things especially when it comes to booty.	Then I think _she_ might be right.
I agree with Alex. Yeah, I've been thinking about it a lot, and I think that, you know, she's right about Mr. Barnes we can't we can't just jump to conclusions.	What would you say if I told you I feel ready right...now.
Hey, tell me something: What do what do you think about Alex?	Oh, I am _so_ surprised.
I'm serious. Look, no ramifications, nothing, just tell me what you think	He's not sleeping with her.
You're jealous!	I don't like her; I don't trust her, and I'm afraid that she's gonna hurt you.
So, "Shut up" because you're so jealous of her...that you don't even care that I'm happy for once.	Shut up!
Do not, under any circumstances, say what you're thinking.	Do you honestly believe that's what's going on here?
I'm sorry, but you had your chance with me.	Do not, under any circumstances, say what you're thinking.
Why don't I ever listen to me?	I'm sorry, but you had your chance with me.
When an Attending calls a lowly intern for a consult, it's an unwritten law that the intern should agree with whatever he says.	The guy has two-vessel disease, and he hasn't been tried on medical management, so he's got a couple options and neither....
Wow...that's my pager!	Actually, sir, uh, I recommend bypass surgery.
And it was just then that they realized what was really going on: Dr. Cox was in love with Turk's girlfriend!	Hey, Sweetie.
So...you were wrong.	So?
When you can't make things right with one of your best friends, nothing can make you feel better.	Yeah, it's not about that anymore, is it?
So, are we doing this, or what?	Hey, I'm finally off; do you wanna get out of here?Hello?
Mm-mm, Mm-mm. Don't look, no, no. Don't look, no, no.I already brushed, like, eight times, but I'm gonna wanna take some mints out of your purse.	Relax! The first one's a freebie, so you can get your form back.Mmm. I'm gonna change.
These are Percocet.	See, all I did was lose the pants, but I think it gives me a completely different look.
So, you never came over here last night 'cause you just passed out.	J.D....
The speech always sounds the same, no matter whose mouth is comes out of even if it's someone you thought you could really like.	Yep...I should I should go; yeah.
We ended up talking for a while after that....	Hey, look, you don't understand, okay; my job comes with a lot of stress. It's it's not like I have a serious problem.
No, but I never even made	You owe me twenty bucks.
All right, I should've done this a long time ago; so, here goes: I'm sorry. I shouldn't accuse you of being jealous, you were just looking out for me, and...you were right about Alex.	Twenty bucks.
No.... But, why does that matter?	You never did sleep with her, did you?
Are you sure?	Because I was jealous.
This.	What are you thinking about?
Ew.	Great job last night, buddy.
Good thing you came along. I've been stuck on four since med school.OWWWWW!	Ew.
All the time!	Dammit.We we really shouldn't feel weird about this. I mean, this things like this happen all the time.
It's not a big deal!	Yeah, it's, uh, it's really not a big deal.
No more repeating....	Okay, you've gotta stop repeating everything I say in that weird tone of voice.
I totally agree.	Look, J.D., what happened last night was a wonderful mistake. I think it's probably best if we just go back to the way things were.
Tomorrow...	Well, I'm gonna see you tomorrow.
What are you doing? Elliot's amazing, and you're crazy about her. If you let her leave, I'm gonna do this all day: "I get knocked down! But I get up again! You're never gonna keep me down! I get knocked down! "	Tomorrow...
Wait, Elliot.Look, I just, uh.... Argggh.... I...I....	What are you doing? Elliot's amazing, and you're crazy about her. If you let her leave, I'm gonna do this all day: "I get knocked down! But I get up again! You're never gonna keep me down! I get knocked down! "
Yeah, let's do that.	Oh, my God, just say it! Say, "Elliot, stay in bed and have sex with me all day until neither one of us can move."
Oh, I'm I'm good for that.Whoa.... I got...to, uh....	I cannot believe you almost let me leave.You're gonna pay for that.
You don't really smile, though, you just make this face...	Oh, don't joke. My mom would come sit in the front row and tell me I'd look prettier if I smiled more.
Well, I was, girl. I mean, four times? I mean, seriously, give it up.	What about you? You just look surprised that you're actually having sex!
Yeah, you did.	I think I already did.
What movie are we watching?	God, how weird was that this morning? I mean, have you ever been more uncomfortable in your entire life?
It's 'Basic Instinct', grandma....Yeah, once. But see, all this sex, it just soothes my soul....	What movie are we watching?
...And I really like your nose....	Mmmm.
I don't even remember. I just know I went to the door, and when I came back, you said I looked sexy holding a pizza.	How did that last time even start?
No, no....	Oooh, you did.Okay, for safety reasons, I should go. I should really go.
You're not going anywhere; 'cause you know why? You gotta help me eat this pizza.	Yep.
See, now, you even look sexy holding that slice.	Okay.
You do.	...I do, don't I?
But it'll it'll help people.Like those two, for instance. I mean, they've been dancing around each other for months, now.And you know what, excuse me for not being afraid to show people around here how I feel about you.	No, J.D. J.D., I just think it's best if we keep this between us for right now. I mean, it's hard enough at work without everybody talking.
Not just the guys.Good morning, Dr. Cox!	You just want the guys to know you're getting some!
Excuse me?	Dude, H.F.F.A.
I don't know. Why should I know? You know, it's funny that you think I would know I have no idea where she is.	So, Elliot says she's looking for a surgical consult. Do you know where she is?
Ha! Clever! You know, she told me she's not going out with anyone, you should ask her out.	I know where The Todd would like Elliot to be: In his pants!
Dude, Joanie loves Chachi.	Whoa, Ell no, no. Elliot and The Todd? That's a terrible couple. That's that's worse than Joanie and Chachi.
Please....	The Todd is asking Elliot out. I think she'd be lucky to ride my
You know what, let me let me talk to her for ya.	All I heard was "lesbian."
I don't know.... Because you're cute, and you're fun...and I told him to....	Why did he ask me out?
Plus, there's rumors going around that you're a lesbian.Look, you told me not to tell anyone about us, and I guess maybe I just wanted to make a point. And, uh...now I'm gonna kiss you.	What?
Okay, let's do it; let's have the talk.	You know what, after I have sex five times with somebody, I...usually like to have the relationship talk.I know, I know it seems rushed, but, you have to understand, five times usually takes me anywhere between six months and seven years.
Yep. You my girlfriend?	Okay. You my boyfriend?
Cool.Good to talk things through.	Yep!
Well, from now on, that is your laugh.	I love that little laugh!
Yeah, I just, I saw all of that.Ohh, don't be shy; come here, baby....See the echo report on the aorta...	Ohh.... So if I go like this:
What are you talking about?	Bravo; just a big bravo. Heaven help me, I love Newbie Theatre. Honest, I do.It's the way you both play your parts with such wonderful commitment that almost had me believing that you aren't having whiny, neurotic, extremely pale sex with each other.
Oh, please, you guys are just jealous 'cause you're not the new hot couple in town anymore.	We don't look like that!
Well, I tell you what, while you guys were sleeping, we were up in the kitchen, fryin' up some love!	You don't have to tell them that.
I'm sorry.We didn't.	That is not funny.
Oh, come on. Elliot!	Oh, that's great. Thanks, um, thanks a lot, J.D. Really mature.
I cannot have anymore until I work off the last two slices.So, what do you say: fat, gassy, bloaty sex?	Yeah. Big one.
I don't care.	Okay.Oh, I'm gonna puke!
But it's your laugh I gave it to you.	Ohh.... that laugh.
Well, see, it's not as charming if you're mad.	Yeah, I love it so much, I can't stop using it.
That's not true.	You know you only laugh at your own jokes? I mean, you never laugh at anything I do.
Oh, all right, maybe you just don't know funny. Okay; let me help you out: Silly hats are funny; ALF, very funny; anyone in a chicken suit.... Oh! Over-sized phones are funny.	Oh hey, Dr. Cox, I'm open! Hit me!There was nothing funny about that.
Hold on.Hello? ... ... She's right here.It's for you.	J.D....
Probably just a bad ball.	I'm not being obsessive, but I rolled that damn thing exactly the way the video I bought told me to.
You know what, Elliot, it's hard to be honest with you when you're so neurotic, you don't even trust the computer to keep your score.	You don't always have to patronize me, I mean, you could just be honest with me and tell me that I suck.
I'm sorry!	Oh, so now I'm neurotic.
Bowling's a tricky sport.	Is it always this hard?
I know what you meant. It's difficult for everybody.	No, I meant
Want me to pick you up...?	My turn!
Uhhhh.... Well, technically, yes.But, you know, it's it's really a judgment call, and if she really was that bradycardic, I probably would've called the fellow....But I, that's that's me. I....	Is she right, J.D.?
I just I I don't want him to think it's about our relationship.	Yeah, you should've.
Well, if I didn't respect you, I wouldn't be having sex with you. ...That's not true, I totally would be!	Look, I know that you want Dr. Cox to like you and to respect you, but you should want me to like and respect you, too.
Ohh, a perfect dismount off her high horse.	Look, if you can't talk about this for real, then forget it.
Why is it impossible for you to ever let anything go?	If you don't like something, why don't you just say it; I mean, why do you always have to hide behind your stupid little jokes!?
And when are you when are you letting that stuff go?	Oh, I let tons of stuff go; like when you wouldn't stand up for me in front of Dr. Cox. Or when you started telling everyone we know that we're having sex.
Oh, and that's a bad thing? That's a bad thing, Elliot? Why don't why don't we get all of my friends together in a room and we'll fight your friend.	Fine. You wanna know why I won't let that go? Because the only reason that you wouldn't stand up for me is that you're so terrified that someone, somewhere, in this hospital won't like you.
Look, Elliot, this is me, okay? And there's a lot of people here who like me for who I am. I thought you were one of 'em.	I'm getting so tired of this.
Things that wouldn't'a bothered you a week ago in a friendship become so incredibly important when sex is involved. I just...I think it'd be easier if you weren't friends with your girlfriend.... At all.	The Psychologist's Office
Am I in a relationship now?	J.D.
......No.	J.D.
Oh please, Elliot, I had, like, two pieces.	I can't believe I ate half a pizza.
I will. 'Cause I'm a gentleman.	If you tell anyone anything about today, please leave that part out.
Yeah... I think it's gonna be great.	So......Do you think this is gonna work out?
I believe me, too.	I believe you.
Don't let her get the last word.	You watch where you're walking.
Just... You watch where you're walking.	Don't let her get the last word.
Damn!	You watch where you're walking!
Try as hard as you can to avoid them, you're bound to runAnd the next day...And the next day.	Damn!
You don't even play sports.	Try as hard as you can to avoid them, you're bound to runAnd the next day...And the next day.
Feel better?	It so happens, this helps me to relieve stress.
I guess the only positive is that our hospital is like one	You look like you got problems. You're a girl. Hence, girl
Dr. Cox, I was wondering-	I guess the only positive is that our hospital is like one
Yep, it's a good place to heal.	At least they're real.
Even though I see death all the time now, I still react the	You okay?
I used to like the Silver Surfer.Hang ten! Hang...	Yeah, the correct answer to that question is 'Nothing, Sir.'Oh. My. God. Would you look at this hellhole? If I have to see
I guess after a while you get used to Dr. Cox's rants.	Get in here.
The truth is that Dr. Cox isn't really angry. He's justOkay, maybe he's a little angry.	And of course the lab tech is nowhere to be found, so I can't get
We didn't need those... so... all done?He broke his pencil...	The truth is that Dr. Cox isn't really angry. He's justOkay, maybe he's a little angry.
Yo, you are not going to believe what Dr. Cox...It's you.	I'm a nervous poo-er.
Ugh. Could Turk have picked anyone worse to be doing this	Yeah. It's me.
Uh, I'm going to go to bed.	If this is a peripheral vascular disease study, they might find it
You are not going to believe what happened yesterday. Dr. Cox justOh yeah. Broken computers, chairs through windows, shattered beakers.	Careful, I've been hurt before.
All the way?Okay boy. Who is it?	Downtown.
But Dr. Cox, I...Okay! Okay!	Listen up, little piggy. You open up this
Look, Dr. Cox, I'd invite you in, but I...	Oh dear lord, please tell me that's not a onesie.
Oh thank God.	Marcia, I have no interest in coming in.
Ah, minty.Okay, so we're here. What do you want to talk about?	Thank you.
Ah, yucky.	Laura, if you don't toss that shot back, I'm going to throw you up on
Yucky.	Yucky?
So if you're not going to talk to me, what's the point of sitting here	My god, I'm drinking with a mouseketeer. Two more.
Hello, ladies. Oh yes, it's a onesie.	You know, it's a good point. It is Excuse me, ladies? Do you know anybody who might like to
Oh, yeah, of course.Look, Dr. Cox. Don't get me wrong, I love getting drunk in my jammies	We had two good years, and two bad years. But not all at once.
Well. You seem fine, so...	Thanks for coming out, there, Newbie. Hope this whole thing wasn't too
I love to melt the middle.	I'm not fine. I mean, why do you think we're out here at this bar at 2
I, uh, think I left my wallet in my other onesie.	And you owe me $53.

I beg to differ.	Well, hold on a second there Rainbow! This just off the newswire!
How you like me now, bitch?Maybe I just don't have anything bottled up.	Well, at least I let mine go. You, if you ever were able to actually

Thank you, Dr. Reid. Okay guys. One, two, three!	Dr. Dorian, we're ready for the finale.
It felt really good.	Thank you, Dr. Reid. Okay guys. One, two, three!
...Cooler.	I'm open.
You see...it's a lot cooler if we don't make a big deal out of it.	Woman. Woman! Shush.
Whatever.	Hold on a minute.
The point is, we've found our stride; we know all the ins and outs.	Whatever.
That was me.	Heh. My bad.
Sir.	Morning, sir.
Elliot, that is disgusting.	Well, Mrs. Winston, it's back to the home for you.
Ow!	I hate you guys! I hate you, I hate you, I hate you!
Let's face it, we've earned the right to be a little cocky.	Ow!
Jerome!	Let's face it, we've earned the right to be a little cocky.
And I gotta tell ya, nobody can take this feeling away. Nobody.	My man! Hey, who the hell is Jerome?
Because after months of having to do everyone else's scut-work, we're finally not the lowest people on the totem pole.	Oh, thank goodness, it's the Mod Squad.
You see, today...we get our very own med students.	Look at you three, all excited!
The devil's greatest trick was convincing the world he didn't exist.	They're actually buying it.
Giiirl!	Babay!
Sugar darlin'!	Nope! But, knowing this hospital, it's probably someone black!
So, I dunno-I'm just thinking I wa-I want someone I can be friends with, you know?	Giiirl!
Don't worry about it, man, I do that all the time.	I know what this looks like, but...
No.	Really? Do you ever part your hair on the wrong side just to see what you look like to other people?
So, do you have any questions before we get started?	It totally messes everyone up!
Easy, tiger!	Yeah, what's the babe situation like around here?
Oh, boy.	Easy, tiger!
Ahhhhh! Okay, so you're gonna do H&Ps, you're gonna do admission ordersWhat are ya doin'?	Uhhhh.
A famous doctor once said, "Show me a med student that only triples my work, and I'll kiss his feet."	Oh, um.... I can't really walk and write at the same time it makes me nauseous.
Okay, okay, okay. Bye-bye. Bye-bye! Moving on. See you later. Help someone else. I'm sorry.	Oh, uh, ye we were just talking. This guy he is the bomb!
He wrote down the guy sweats when he exercises.	Relax, Bambi. Be nice to Thumper!
I'll call Ripley's!	I do.
Yeah it was! Okay!	Cool! Great first day, Dr. Dorian!
Yes, Carla! They're each one mistake, but when you put 'em all together, it makes, like, 4 million mistakes!	Relax, Bambi, it's just one mista
I'm sorry.	Mmm-hmmm.
I'm s I'm sorry.	Yeah, you are.
Carla... I gotta go home.	Egh.
No, no, no. But Josh did all this.	Hold it, Q-Tip. You have to co-sign all these orders, fill out a vascular consult on Bed 3, and get a tox-screen for Mrs. O'Brien.
Mrs. O'Brien, I'm afraid I'm gonna need a urine sample.	Uh-uh, honey. I don't think so.
Wh-what was it that tipped you off? Was it your, uh, inability to perform even the simplest task? I'll bet it was the fact that I only got home twenty minutes ago because I spent the entire night cleaning up after you!	I came by because...I know I didn't do so great yesterday, but
Well, you know what, Josh, you should be scared. Because, I gotta be honest with you I don't think you got what it takes. Do you?I didn't think so.You can stare at me all you want, I'm still not gonna feel bad about what I said to Josh.You don't scare me, woman!I'm so sorry, I'll apologize at rounds.Oh, Nurse Roberts, have you seen Josh?	I'm sorry. Um...I was just really scared.
I didn't mean for that to happen! I didn't.	Nice job, Bambi.
Okay, here's what happened.	J.D. trying to keep up with Elliot.
I mean, he was screwing up constantly.	J.D. Trying to keep up with Nurse Roberts.
It's not like I forced him to quit.	J.D. trying to keep up with Turk.
I just don't think it's my fault he quit.	J.D. standing against the doorframe looking into the Admissions Area.
I was talking to her.	I don't know.... I think most of the bad things that happen around here are your fault.
Even Nurse Roberts says he's the most incompetent young doctor she's ever worked with.	Well, I'm not gonna tell you what you wanna hear.
It's not my fault he failed.	That he was the most incompetent young doctor I ever worked with.
Kidding! Josh! But you know what, forget all of that. The thing is, you have to hang in there. Now, I promise you, I am gonna help you.Here we go!You're doin' it! You're doin' it! Yeah you are! You're doin' it!So what do you say?	You told me I shouldn't be a doctor.
Why would anyone feel sorry for you?	Look, Dr. Dorian, I know what you're trying to do. My whole life, people have felt sorry for me.
But Josh, those are the same things that I was dealing with when I first started here.... Except for the the ass part.... I actually have a...great ass. It's...firm, like mutton.	Look at me! I'm clumsy, I'm always throwing up, I don't even have an ass!
Newbie, wait.	I can't.
Shut up.Look, Josh. You're the one who knows whether you wanna be a doctor or not. But right now, I kinda got my hands full, okay? So whatta ya say you put some gloves on, Shirley, and get the hell in here.Okay, now, locate the radial pulse.Josh, look at me.You can do this.	"Newbie"?
What do you want, a cookie? Go put your scrubs on and get back here.Go go go!	No way!
Could you...re-do that?	G'head.That's it.
I think a lot of us get freaked out when med students come because it feels like being forced to accept new people into your family.It changes everything. Me, I was more struck by how these "newbies" made me look at myself....	I know, isn't it great!
Elliot, have you seen my clipboard?	I guess.
How's it going, man?	No. Nope. Oh, this'll be fun. J.D., I would like you to meet, J.D.
Are you bummed out that we have the same name?Oh, don't don't worry about it, man; I'll tell you what you're a little bit older than I am, so you were J.D. first. So how about you'll be J.D. Number One, and I'll just be J.D. Number Two. How about that?	Make him leave.
Hey Number One. So, uh, I've got one more patient, do you want to have lunch in ten minutes and you can bring my clipboard?	Hey Number Two.
Okay.	Yeah.
Number One!All right, cool.	Hey, Number Two!
Number One!	Hey, Number Two!
I honestly think the best part about working here is the patients. When they see how much you care, they're always grateful.	Number One!
Okay, Mr. Simon. Good morning, how you feeling?	About time. Idiot.
No, sir, I was just trying to assess how you're	I was just asking Nurse Fajita here if you guys get extra points for asking stupid questions.
Carla, please. Sir, if there's anything I can do to make your stay here more comfortable	Bambi. Don't bother.
Okay. Will you hold me after?Maybe we shouldn't bother.	You can kiss my man-sized ass!
Which one?	Hey Bambi, you know Mr. Simon made one of the night nurses cry?
Frank used to be a Navy SEAL.	Frank.
Hey, Number One.	Hey, Number Two!
Simon says "Hello"!	Because, Bambi, you're kind of like a doctor. Now come on, he's just another patient.
Just going to have Carla here give you a little stronger pain medication.	What the hell do you want?
Toodles.	Beat it, junior.
What?Hey! Hey, is that my stethoscope?	No. Um, Maybe you left it in one of the girl's bathrooms?
I'm not hiding from Mr. Simon, I have a new exercise program; it's called 'Short Bursts'.	You don't have to hide from Mr. Simon.
Do you have to ask?	Mmm, is it working?
Huh. Where did Mr. Simon go?	Yeah.
Hey, Number One. What happened?	Hey, Number Two!
Hey, Number One. Did you give him a dose of naloxone?	Hey, Number Two!
He went so fast.	Hey, Number Two!
Hey, Number One.	Yeah. Say "Hey, Number One".
Just thought I'd talk to you guys.	Not now, maybe in the morning before work...
Mommy, are you and Daddy playing wheelbarrow?	J.D., when you were a kid, did you used to walk into your parent's room in the middle of the night?
Son, you go back to bed, I'm fixing Mommy's back.	Mommy, are you and Daddy playing wheelbarrow?
Yes, once.	Son, you go back to bed, I'm fixing Mommy's back.
I just can't stop thinking about Mr. Simon. I neglected him because he was such a jerk; and I'm just kinda worried that's what killed him.	What's up, Bambi?
You're right. Argh...thank you, Carla.	Well, could have been the neglect. Could have been the terminal cancer. Bambi, you're a conscientious doctor, you'd never do anything to hurt a patient, you know that.
Peace out, Turk!	Mmm-hmm.
We all know what goes on in the bedroom...	Night.
It's back?	Bambi. About yesterday.
Morbidity and Mortality conferences are just fun little meetings they have when they think you may be in any way responsible for a patient's death.	Uh, they want you to present Mr. Simon at a M and M conference this afternoon.
Is it hot in here? It's, like, it's hot!No, I'm fine.	Bambi. Don't be nervous.
Still, there's no reason to start obsessing. You did nothing wrong.	Okay.
Hey, Number One.	Hey, Number Two!
Okay, you have to stop doing that. Look, Number One	Hey, Number Two!
Okay, listen, I know we have the same name, and I feel very bad about that; but I can't spend every second of my day playing this game with you. I'm sorry, I...	Number Two!
I'm a kay? That was terrible; can I have a do-over?	Dr. Dorian, we have examined Aaron Simon's file. Before we begin, do you have any last words?
Actually, Sir, I I'm not sure how this whole thing usually works, but I was kinda hoping we could take a closer look at me.I've been sorta doubting my performance, and it would it would be really helpful if we could all talk about it. As a group.	Initially there were concerns that Mr. Simon may have been over-medicated. We have concluded that his pain control was both adequate and well within normal limits. Thank you for stopping by.
Bottom line, Dr. Kelso isn't looking to do me any favors. If I did something wrong, he'd call me on it...	Actually, Sir, I I'm not sure how this whole thing usually works, but I was kinda hoping we could take a closer look at me.I've been sorta doubting my performance, and it would it would be really helpful if we could all talk about it. As a group.
...then how come I still can't sleep?	Bottom line, Dr. Kelso isn't looking to do me any favors. If I did something wrong, he'd call me on it...
But I didn't overmedicate him!	Yep, looks like you screwed the pooch there, Tinkerbell.
Depends what you mean by different, I	Of course you didn't, and I always check your orders after you make them. But if you're wondering whether or not you treated Mr. Simon differently because he's a complete jerk, well... I think you know the answer to that one already, don't you?
Uh huh.	I have to warn you, I just got dumped in front of my ex-wife not ten minutes ago, okay Betty? It's always easy to treat the nice ones nice, isn't it?
You know, it's, uh it's barely misting out...	But your drug addicts, your child abusers, your garden-variety jerks... Man.
Mine too!	It's my hair, if it even gets damp, it frizzes out and becomes wildly unmanageable.
Hey, Number One. How you doing, man?	Hey, Number Two!
I guess there's good and bad in all of us.	Hey, Number One. How you doing, man?
What!?	Bambi.
Come on, what right do they have to be so damn mopey?	Mm-mm. Mm-mm.
And that’s when Elliot said something that explained everything.	Come on, what right do they have to be so damn mopey?
Oh, I am so sorry.	Our parents are coming.
I could tell my friends were pretty upset. Still, there was a bright side....	Oh, I am so sorry.
It’s all right.	I could tell my friends were pretty upset. Still, there was a bright side....
...I knew I could make it worse.	It’s all right.
You missed a spot!	...I knew I could make it worse.
I like the pictures.	You know, you can help. You can't even hear the television!
If I believed in karma, I might be a little more cautious about giving these guys a hard time...	I like the pictures.
Hey, Dad. No, no, nothing. Turk and Elliot are freaking out because their parents are coming to visit.	If I believed in karma, I might be a little more cautious about giving these guys a hard time...
But karma doesn't scare me!	Hey, Dad. No, no, nothing. Turk and Elliot are freaking out because their parents are coming to visit.
No, no, no, no, it hasn't been that long since you and I saw each other.Dad...	But karma doesn't scare me!
My mom and dad got divorced when I was seven. I know that's not so unusual but even though everyone's relationship with their father seems different, mine always seemed *very* different.	Oh, get some chips!Wowzer! Rowdy's a boy dog.
Dad, please!	God, I'd like to take a run at her. Would you take a look at her rack?
Okay, you know, I think I'm going to hit the sack before I get even more uncomfortable.	That is correct, Christopher.
There it is!	You know, your mother had a beautiful bosom.
Oh, my God! Dad!	Fire in the hole!
That was a nice moment.	Count it!
I guess everyone's parents drive them crazy.	That was a nice moment.
Parents have a way of making their children regress.	Mmm-hmmm.
Well, sort of. Elliot and Turk wrote this paper and then my dad decided "I want to come, too!"	What in the hell is this? Parents weekend?
Yeah...	Look, Reba, if I ask you a question that doesn't specifically deal with a medical issue, you can bet your powdered bottom that I don't want you to answer. Do you understand?
Ooo! Ooo!	It's like... working with a monkey!
Nothing.	What?
Can I help you, sir? Sir?	So, uh, how long are you guys staying?
Excuse me?	You can help me by minding your own damn business!
Nice meeting you.	Oh, aggressive, huh? Do you really want to get it on with me, Pipsqueak? Because if you do, I guarantee it'll be the last stupid thing you ever do on God's green earth.
What the hell was that about?	Nice meeting you.
He can't be that mad. We both know that even though residents are supposed to teach you, they really only show up when they want something.	This is your basic arthrocentesis, there, Newbie. Your resident should've showed you how to do this a long time ago.
Actually, I	Hey, I have to give the med students a lecture on heart murmurs tomorrow. Could you cover for me?
That sucks. I totally wanted to spend some time with my dad tomorrow.	Thanks, man.
What do you mean?	Then take him?
I don't I don't think you really get my dad. He's not really interested in my work. He's more like a buddy.	Uh, I don't know, secure a vehicle of some kind car, balloon, tricycle and transport your father from wherever he is to where you're going to be.
The thing is, I don't really need a buddy. What I need is a father.	Ohhh-kay, that was my mistake. Here I engaged you and gave you the impression that I actually care which is just so wrong! God!
I have testicles.He's he's a kidder! Heh.	Well, you definitely need something. Um, maybe a backbone, or perhaps some testicles. At the very least, a pillow that you could carry around the hospital and just cry your sad eyes out into whenever drama occures.
What? Nobody knows that.	What is the mechanism of cheyne-stokes respiration in systolic dysfunction?
If that's not saying, "I love you and I'm proud of you," I'm not really sure what is.	Can you believe my dad winked at me?
And that's when I decided to take a chance.	I know! Lemme tell ya, there are no gratuitous winks in the Reid household. It's like...
That means a lot, Dad.	Are you kidding? I'd love to come to your heart murmur lecture! I'm a big fan of those things!
Hi, Ms. Turk.	Thank you.
Well, uhh, umm...	John Dorian, get over here.
Well, remember on Thanksgiving when I said your turkey was dry and you picked me up and shook me?	After all these years, are you still afraid of me?
And that's when it happened.	I know! It kills me!
That's when Carla realized she was exactly like Turk's mom.	Make a decision!
But Dad, you sell office supplies.	Work is great, Johnny. I like to believe that I'm selling dreams.
I always thought parents were like tornadoes.They blow into town and devastate everything in their path.	Yeah, I prefer to call them dreams. I'm gonna-I'm gonna steal another Jell-o.
There's no food on your tray.	Hi...
But it's different for me.	Oh.
No.	How you doin', Elliot?Great talk. Uh, anyway, Johnny, I was talking to my buddy Jake this afternoon. You remember my buddy Jake?
Right!	Well, anwyay, Jake's my buddy and he's leaving the country for who knows how long so I thought I might get out of here tomorrow afternoon and go catch up with him which would mean I'd miss your thing but I wouldn't know what I was hearing anyway. Right?
I think what surprised me the most was that I was actually surprised.	Right!
I probably should have woken him up to say good-bye, considering he'd be gone before I got home. I told myself I wanted to let the old guy get some sleep but even I didn't believe that.	You still talking to yourself? I thought you'd outgrow that by now.
Yeah, I'm not that busy.	Yo, J.D., you wanna grab a bite with us tonight after Elliot and I do our presentation?
I meant that later I'm not that busy	Well, if you're not that busy, then you have time to do this discharge summary for me.
Arrrrgh!	Fantastic!
What is with parents anyway? Why is it so easy for them to make us feel bad?	Fine.One...
My dad flaked on me again.	Now, you've got to at least try and pace yourself, Newbie, otherwise sure as shootin' you're going to burn out. Come.Oh, I heard the sad sigh, I see your shoulders are slumped, and I'm aware that you have some whiny-ass problem that you want to talk to me about because you probably think it'd be cathartic to get it the hell off your chest but believe me it won't be. What you've got to do, for me, is the healthy thing. Keep all of your feelings bottled up inside where they *so* belong!
What? No!	I'm sorry, um, you're not on drugs, are you?
I skipped lunch but I've been snacking all day.	Are you in jail? Have you been beaten? Are you malnourished?
Well, he did some considerable emotional damage, so...	You are, in fact, a perfectly healthy twenty-six-year-old doctor who keeps crying about how horrible his father was.
Part of me thought Cox was wrong and I had every reason to be angry with my father.	Oh, mama!
If it's okay with you, we just won't talk right now. Got a needle. Need to focus.	So... how's it going down there?
But then I stopped thinking of my dad as a father, and started thinking of him as a man. And I realized some things that deep down I probably always knew. Like, maybe he wasn't crashing on my couch to spend more quality time with me but because he couldn't afford a hotel room.And maybe he wasn't going to see his buddy Jake to catch up, but because Jake was someone he might be able to sell something to and he really needs a sale.And maybe the truth is, he's just a middle-aged lonely guy trying to get by and it sure would be nice if someone would give him a break once and a while.	If it's okay with you, we just won't talk right now. Got a needle. Need to focus.
Hey, Dad.	But then I stopped thinking of my dad as a father, and started thinking of him as a man. And I realized some things that deep down I probably always knew.

You know, I did, but I got someone to cover for me because I wanted to make sure I caught you and let you know how cool it was to see you.	Hey, there he is! I thought you had to work all day.
Yeah.	Really?
That would be really great.	Well... Well, listen, I, um, you know, I have to travel a lot lately so I'm sure I'll be back in this region again soon. I could swing back out to see you.
Great.	Great.
I see you've been taking advantage of the farting policy.	Great. I'd be happy to see you.
I'm not gonna pull your finger!	Hey, pull my finger!
Maybe the mistake we make is thinking our parents will change.And maybe they did a better job than we give them credit for.And maybe there, amid all the crap they dumped on us, are some things worth keeping. Like a passion for something you never knew you had. Or the ability to constantly surround yourself with people who love you.	Oh, me neither, sir.Oh, they were all out.Placement of an iliac stent when hemodynamic results of PTA are inadequate or primary stent placement at the initial time of PTA...
And "Z" is for the Zs you'll be getting, now that you know heart murmurs from "A" to "Z."What are you doing here?	Thank you very much, folks. We've been great.
I know, but did you see "A" through "K"? 'Cause I did a really cool thing with "A" through "K."	Yeah, I just figured I'd come down and check it out. You know, see how you were doing. And for the record, that was atrocious. I mean, downright abysmal.
Tell me about it.	Yup.Heh, heh. Parents, huh?
I missed this.	Yeah, what's that, a shot at my dad? That's stepping over the line, pal.
Come on, man, let's get out of here. There's something to do, there's......film festivals, there's theatre, there's museums. Let's get out and get some culture! How 'bout some of that!	Nothing.... Nothing.
Turk turns everything in to a competition. It can get kind of annoying.	Let's put Rowdy on top of the TV and see which one of us can throw a hat on him first.
What?	Let's play Steak.
No, see, I paid seventeen dollars for this steak, and I'm not gonna....You want some?	Steak: The first person to finish their steak is the winner of Steak.
The problem is, these stupid games always seem to end the same way.	Uh-huh.Ankles is a simple game: The first one to get embarrassed and pull up their scrubs loses.
I'm your beeyotch.	HA! HahahahaHA! Say it!Say it!Just say it.
It wasn't a race! Okay, fine! Let's just play, uh, let's play Tip Over the Trash-Can! Okay?I win!I...I win.	Good, clean win, T-Dog. Now, let's go down to the Caf and get our doughnut on.
Yeah.	Can I play?
Yeah.	This is fun.
How is that helpful? Do you not get the whole doctor-patient relationship thing? We're supposed to be a team.	You may have whatever you want, there, cowboy.
Doug. Look away!	Ahhh, sorry to interrupt you, there, Bobbo, but I gotta ask you a quick question. Now, when you were born nay, "spawned" by the Dark Prince himself, did that rat-bastard forget to give you a hug before he sent you along your way? Because you can't just let two good nurses go on account of feeling small and insignificant. And, besides, with your money, you oughtta able to keep a little man tucked away in the closet and bring him out whenever you want to knock him around, huh?As you were.
Okay, Mr. Hoffner, here's your surgical consult. But, I have to warn you, he's gonna agree with the medical course I set out for you. Now then, Dr. Turk, why don't you tell Mr. Hoffner whether or not you think he should have surgery.	I'd like chicken.
Okay, the important thing to remember is that we're both professionals, and we should behave as such in front of the patient.	I think he should have the surgery.
You can't consider this a reoccurrence! He was under-treated last time!	And no girlfriends. It's a...gassy disease.
That's why we're gonna give him frequent colonoscopies!	He's high-risk for colon cancer!
I can't believe you're turning this into a competition. Luckily, it's not up to you it's up to Mr. Hoffner.	How frequent?
You're getting a meat plate for dinner!	I'm gonna go with surgery.
Aaaaaaaaaaaagggggggghhhhhhhhhh!	"A surgeon and a doc, above...it...all!"
I'm your beeyotch.	Say it!
I AM!	Oh, it's okay, Jumbo; it's okay! Now, who's my big boy? Oh, who's my big boy!
I am!	Oh, you're my big boy!
I'm a big	You're my big boy!
What's up, Benedict.	Rough all over. So don't talk to me, Joanie, just go talk to your patient. Go!
Benedict Arnold?	What?
Oh yeah?	That's just the lamest smack-talk I've ever heard in my life.
Well, that's not what the red-coats thought!	Yeah.
So, what's up, man? You're gonna go under the knife just 'cause that guy told you to?	Wow! You went Colonial on his ass!
Like who?	No, I spoke to some other people.
He's a janitor!	All fixed.
What???	Look, I'm just a janitor, I don't know much, but I do know this: You need surgery.
Doug, for God's sakes!	Dr. Kelso.... I'm sorry. I was wrong.
I, too, decided it was time to act like the most confident girl in the room, and face things head-on.	No problem!
That was my patient, Turk! I brought you in as my friend, and you're so damn competitive you just go ahead and take him from me? That sucks!	I, too, decided it was time to act like the most confident girl in the room, and face things head-on.
Excuse me?	Tough.
Oh, you know, that sounds like a great friendship.	You're damn right I'm competitive. See, that's what makes me a good doctor I want to win at everything every day, and you should, too.
He never got the concept of the team.	Dude, if you don't wanna play Steak again, that's fine, all right? This has nothing to do with friendship, and you know it! So stop blaming me, because the truth is you're angry at yourself 'cause you couldn't get the guy to believe in you!
I win at Cookie.	I know. Have a cookie, man.
When most of your time is spent fighting a constant stream of death and illness, you'll look for any victory you can get, even if it's just a victory over your own self-doubt.	Yes.
Of course, sometimes, your ego leads you into battles you can't possibly win.And sometimes, you have to admit that feeling competitive isn't a bad thing. Because, if you truly believe you're right, you have to be willing to fight for it.	WOO! I got a date. I got a date.
Listen, I know what I'm telling you is the right way to go, and I am not gonna take "no" for an answer. So, what do you say?	Of course, sometimes, your ego leads you into battles you can't possibly win.And sometimes, you have to admit that feeling competitive isn't a bad thing. Because, if you truly believe you're right, you have to be willing to fight for it.
What?	You won. Now beat it.
Bottom line, when the stakes are high, you have to go for the win. You know, as long as you don't get caught up in the petty stuff.	Go.Let's get you some sherbet!
One of the best things about women is that they're so unpredictable. Of course, that can really bite you in the ass.	Yep. Right.
Look! It's got a letter!	Boink. Who's your new friend?
And I was having problems with my lady, too.	"Eat your doughnut."
Nurse Roberts is gonna take a blood sample so we can check your Hepatitis viral load absolutely no big deal.	Can we get a move on, Q-Tip? I got tickets to "Bring in Da Noise, Bring in Da Funk" and I don't want to miss The Noise.
No big deal at all!	Nurse Roberts is gonna take a blood sample so we can check your Hepatitis viral load absolutely no big deal.
Could somebody get that?	No big deal at all!
In my arm.	Hello! Dr. Dorian, I understand you might need a refresher course in hospital safety. This is a syringe. When filled with infected blood, where is the last place you might want to stick it?
What's this?	Just get him to sign the damn paper!
Thanks. That's, uh, that's comforting.	If you should develop any symptoms that suggest you may have contracted Hepatitis B, this form simply states the hospital is not responsible.
Hey, here's your pen.	Um, I'm I'm sure you'll be fine.
Elliot got some booty! Some booty! Some what? What? Elliot got some	Ahhh, the Walk of Shame. All you can really hope for is a supportive friend to help you get through it.
What? It's my "Elliot Got Some Booty" dance.Oh, come on! Elliot, it's not like anybody else knows.	Stop it!
Somebody got some a action!	Well?
She got some aaaction!Come on...it's funny!	Ugh!
The curse of the scrubs machine one of the hospital's most annoying money savers. The only way to get clean scrubs out is to put dirty ones in.	I can't find my scrubs top! I must have left it at Sean's.
How can I help?	The curse of the scrubs machine one of the hospital's most annoying money savers. The only way to get clean scrubs out is to put dirty ones in.
How else can I help?	Give me your shirt.
Okay.	Just go!
Let me guess golf cart accident?Playing.	All four of us are doctors.
Oh, I got hit with the business end of one of my Hep-B patients' syringes last night.	So, junior, what's with the antecubital veinal puncture?
He's okay, right?	I once had a colleague who got bit by a patient with rabies.
Well, I'll I'll be okay.	Oh, but Hepatitis! Scary stuff.
I, uh, I have to go check on a...thing.	Ohhh...maybe!
Good news, friend. The doctor is in!	I don't have anyone to talk to.
I don't know anything about those.You have to read "Tales of the Fourth Grade Nothing" completely turned high school around for me!	I asked for a newspaper, and they gave me a bunch of Judy Bloom books from Pediatrics.
You see, nobody keeps John Dorian from moving on. Nobody!	I don't know anything about those.You have to read "Tales of the Fourth Grade Nothing" completely turned high school around for me!
You know, I could be really sick here! Could you be nice for once in your life?	We've secretly replaced this doctor's blood with Hepatitis blood. Let's see if he notices!
I know.	It's Ted.
'Kay. Thank you.	Sure, Bambi, no problem.
Aw, John Dorian's a wuss.	'Kay. Thank you.
I would, but I don't got no mojo workin'. Right with the mojo I, um, you know, I have to go lecture some med students on myocardial infarction....	And why can't you do it?
What?	Sure.
What's wrong with them?	I'll take him. You just gotta grab my three gomers in 408.
And...?	Hey, I, uh, thought about what you said before and, um, you're right I haven't been that nice.
I love that!	Doctor.
You knew the answer to that.	HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor?
What's your problem?	Shut up!
No. Oh, come on, I have problems, too!	This stuff doesn't come as easy to me as it does for you, okay? I study every night, and you know what else I have to do to try and remember all this crap? I tape-record myself saying it, and then I listen to myself over and over. Do you have any idea how annoying it is to hear myself go on and on and on...and on...and on...?
I traded my meningitis patient just traded him, like a baseball card. And you wanna know why? Because I was afraid of him!I'm a doctor who's afraid of sick people! You wanna take a picture with me?	Oh?
It's a weird feeling when you realize you've lost the respect of four people all at once. But it's nothing compared to losing respect for yourself.	I traded my meningitis patient just traded him, like a baseball card. And you wanna know why? Because I was afraid of him!I'm a doctor who's afraid of sick people! You wanna take a picture with me?
Why did you let me switch patients with you?	No. Hey, do you know any women who hate themselves enough to actually date me?
No, see, you're full of it you knew I was scared, why didn't you just tell me to go in there and deal with it?	Because you asked me to. Oh, and because of your puppy-dog eyes.
Thank you. Now, can I have my patient back?	Well, gosh, Newbie, I don't know what it was about that day. Maybe I hadn't had enough sleep. Maybe my mind was on other things. Maybe I didn't have enough fiber in my diet, and I failed to do my morning business. I don't know what the hell it was, but the bottom line is I didn't feel like spelling it out for you. And I know, I know, you want your little speech, and that's fine because here it is: You're a doctor. You might get sick. Get over it.
Fantastic.	No. Because, aside from his weird Judy Bloom obsession, I like him. You will be de-lousing Mr. Schaffer guy's like fly-paper!
You know, when you start med school they warn you that you're gonna have to make sacrifices.... But I guess that means different things to different people.	Oh, and, Belinda? D'you know what else is real contagious?A big ol' smile!
Like giving up something you really want now for something you've wanted your whole life.Or spending less time on yourself so you can spend time with someone you really love.	Elliot exits on her way home. Scattered along the wheelchair ramp are the sad remnants of Sean's bouquet.
At some point, you might even have to give up your own sense of safety and well-being.But after a while, it doesn't feel like you're giving up anything at all.	J.D. faces the "Contagious" sign.
You know what? Let's talk "Super Fudge."	Hey, Doc.
I had this patient today, thought he had blood in his stool? Turned out to be pimento!	Is that good cocktail conversation?
What?	Mmgh.
'Boys on the Side'; 'The Doors'; and as for Miss Connolly: topless in 'Inventing the Abbotts', bottomless in 'Requiem for a Dream', and in 'The Hot Spot', you gotta love her frontal and...tush-tush!	Drew Barrymore, Meg Ryan, _and_ Jennifer Connolly?
That's the thing about best friends they just get each other.	You da man.
Neat hug!	Yeah, I scored this big restoration job.So, who's the, uh, fan club?
So, what's that, like your lucky board...or something?	Newbie, no one likes a lookie-loo. Not now, not ever.
Oh, my God, that's disgusting!	Oh, that? No, it's a nail-gun accident.
Oh....	Yeah, yeah!
Ow.	What about the tough guy?
Oh, please don't.	Bye-bye!
I was _surprised_. I don't like surprises.Oh, my goodness!	Well, it's okay you're just a doctor, you shouldn't have to _look_ at stuff like that.
Ooh!	Pictures capture moments in time.
You're a little weird, aren't you.	When they're posed, they're not real. You know, I hate that whole, like, "gneen!" thing. That's why, at a party, you'll see me in the bushes with my camera.
You know, we don't it says it right there on the box.	Wow, re-wrap a dirty bandage. It's phenomenal how you doctors keep all this stuff in your head.
I guess sibling rivalry never goes away. No matter how old you get.	Ugh, you're so...
Me neither!	Me neither.
Yeah, we were....	When spoken to, Newbie. When spoken to. Here, I thought we were clear on that one!
You know, he's never asked me to grab a beer. But I don't care....	Hey, Ben, you realize we haven't grabbed a beer in a couple of weeks what's that about?
Oh, God, yes.To buddies!	Newbie? Would you like to come?
Aww! Good! At last, a worthy foe!	Never naked, but just hand-to-nipple in 'How to Make an American Quilt'.
"Chalk boy"....	Oh, chalk boy....
"Arrr! There's a _____, Newbie! Break it up! "	but it just comes off sounding like a cartoon pirate. "Arrr, Gladys! Chalk it! Don't pleasure it! Arrr!"
Yeah, I'm d I'm done.	Are ya done?
Actually, Ben has been sneaking me beers all night, and I'm quite drunk.	All right, Clara, you can go ahead and order yourself a Cosmopolitan; we'll just grab a cab home.
One of the things that sucks about being a doctor is that you never miss a red flag.	I dunno. Sorta weird, 'cause I cut myself shaving last week and it wouldn't stop bleeding.
I'm with you, Big Dog.	I was a heartbeat away from giving an appendix patient a crotch lobotomy! If I do my best, and I lose a patient? You know what, I can live with that. But if a clerical error is the reason why a guy's walking around here with only the lonely?Well, damn! That don't sit well with the Big Dog!
I was paged because Ben's blood-work was finally ready. Unfortunately, the chart wasn't in the out-box. I'd knock, but the hematopathologist is the meanest, intern-hatingest monster in this hospital.	I'm with you, Big Dog.
The truth is, the hematopathologist was the last person in this hospital I wanted to deal with.	Don't be a chicken. If you need something, just go in and get it.Uh, excuse me, sir?Aggghhh! I'll...come back...later.
OH! Why do you have to jump out and scare me all the time!?	The truth is, the hematopathologist was the last person in this hospital I wanted to deal with.
You're kidding, right?	I don't jump out and scare you! I follow you around all day! I only got about an hour-and-a-half worth of work around here, and the rest of the time I track you...like an animal.
What? How did that get there? Come on, good news.	Haha.... I don't know? Am I? Hmm....
Leukemia.	Hey, Bambi.Are you okay?
No.	Leukemia.
Wait a sec. First Turk's patient, then Elliot's.... This is a mistake, I just I feel it in my gut I'm sure of it!	Oh, Janice! Are those the test results we've been waiting for?
Uhhh, no, this is someth You know that lab is just it's backed up again? And so I'm gonna it's you know, a little while.	Hellooo? Janice?
Turk, I can fight my own battles, man.	Yeah, I know who screwed this up. It's that same lazy-ass admitting nurse that mixed up my files. And there she is! I'm gonna go get her.
No, I lost my thesaurus.	You're not gonna write her one of your angry notes, are you? 'Cause she doesn't deserve it.
Hello......Nancy. Hi, howYeah, could you just check it's a very important file that I	Okay, well you go get her, then!
She said "in a minute," so I'm sure that in a minuteOh, now it's two! You're in.	Tag me in. I am oiled up and ready to go!
You said "drop the ball."	Thank you....Look here: My friend needs you to check on the Ben Sullivan file, and you're gonna do it right now. Why? Because you're not gonna drop the ball like you did on my patient.
Rapido!	I know! That was totally by accident!Chop-chop, Nancy!
No, sir, I just	Hello, Dr. Dorian. Let's take a ride.So.... Word has it you've been doing a little fishing in these here parts trying to catch yourself a big ol' prize-winning mistake.
Franklyn!Can you help me out here?	Okay, I make lots of mistakes. But I really have to go to the bathroom right now, and after that I'm going to lunch.
Can you do that?	What do you want me to do, cry?
Quickly! Quickly!	Sure. Gimme a second to think of something sad.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't even put you in this position. I	Okay, that's not helping!
Stay with it, Elliot....	Oh, there we go. You know, another man in my life trying to protect me.
Good, Elliot, this is good....	I mean, everyone thinks that I'm just this little girl who can't take any criticism because her mom and dad give her nothing but criticism.
...become your mother....	And look where it's gotten me! You know, I'm 26, single, and all I do is work! You know, I may as well just give up the idea of being a healthy and...happy relationship, and just go ahead and.... And.... And....
The admissions clerk office, he didn't make a mistake, and the lab technician didn't make a mistake. Maybe I'm just an idiot, I don't know.	Because so far, no one's screwed up.
Excuse me?	Let me ask you something.You're kind of a boob guy, right?
I think this is the most uncomfortable conversation I've ever had!	I can tell, because I've seen you look at mine. Um, not in a sleazy way, or anything....
I stand corrected! You're my best friend's girlfriend!	You wanna touch one?
I'm afraid so....	Ah, so your instinct is to pass on this fantastic one-time offer?
Oh, sorry.	I'm up here, Bambi.
Well, what am I supposed to do, though?	See, with Ben it's one of two things: Either your instincts are right, or your brain is trying to protect you from something. I'd say you have pretty good instincts. Trust them.
The Hematopathologist.	You know there's only one more person to talk to.
Hello?	The Hematopathologist.
You go by your first name?	Call me Dr. Bob.
"Fred Bob"?	No, first name's Fred.
Hi, I w I was hoping that you could recheck Ben Sullivan's blood smear.	What can I do you for?
I kinda wish you did.	Well, that depends, young man. Do you actually think I made a mistake, or do you just wish I did?
Sticking with the "weird" thing, huh?	Argh! You could hang a freakin' raincoat off my nipples.... Left one at least, only the right one's just a little shy.
No, we wouldn't.	It works for me.Listen, um, you guys wouldn't be keeping me here if there wasn't something potentially wrong with me, would you?
Oh, my God....	Hey! I wanted to ask you, um, how come this guy's always, like, following you in the pictures?
Yeah.	Him.You want to see the rest of the pictures I took today?
These are good, man!Ben, good news, man!	Look at that one.
It was weird how everyone had come to see Ben off.	Come on.
After all, he had only been here one day, and there wasn't even anything wrong with him.	Everybody in?
Wait, why would you want a picture like that? I thought you said that posed pictures aren't real?	After all, he had only been here one day, and there wasn't even anything wrong with him.
What do you mean?	Come on, J.D. None of this is real. You know that.
I kinda wish you did.	Do you actually think I made a mistake, or do you just wish I did?
Uh, yeah.Ben, you have leukemia.	Let's try this again: Are those the test results?
...Yeah....	Well, that sucks.
Uh, I know the nurses call you Sir Plunge-A-Lot.	What's my name?
Ah, come on, I'm sure you don't know my name, so	I know.
How'd you know my middle name?	John Michael Dorian.
Today seems like a good day to hide out in one of my patient's rooms.	Because I care!
Unless, of course, my patient is missing.	You, my friend, are an incompetent fool.
I don't	Where's my brother?
I... think it's great that you're going back to school!	Oh, oh, if you say "I don't know," I'll show you what I learned last week in my crotch-punching class!
Jordan, he found out he had leukemia yesterday. It's life-changing news. You can't be surprised if he's a little depressed.	Why would he wander off? Oh! Maybe he went to a real hospital!
Ben, put the small children down.	Hey, Doc, this guy's got something on his shoulder you might want to take a look at!
No, Ben. Ben! Okay, okay...	Anybody missing one of these?
No, Ben! Ben, seriously! Ben! Not funny! Ben, stop! Ben, put me down. Ben! Fasterrrr! Whooooooo! Ha ha ha ha ha! Eeeee-eagle! Whooo hoooo!	You heard the good doctor. Come on, you'll have to sit this one out. You know, my hands are free which leaves me to do... this!
I don't like that much freedom down there. Makes me tingle in my giblets.	Ha ha, the sweatpants years.
I'm a good intern, but when you're dealing with disease and family, an intern just doesn't cut it. What you need......Is a hero.	I swear, if you don't start taking this seriously...
But I didn't even say anything.	Shut up. Shut up. And definitely shut up.
I hear you, Dr. Cox!	I know, but I enjoy saying it to you. Okay, here's the deal. If we're gonna beat this thing, and we damn sure are, we're gonna do it one way and one way only. We're gonna be a team! We're gonna be a team, team, team, team, team! You hear me?
I'm sorry. I got very excited. Go! Heh.	I am so not speaking to you, Rhonda, thank you!
Wow. He did it!	Go, Team Cancer!
No problem!Uh... got him to put his gown on.	Now, do you think you can make Ben behave like a patient or not?
Antonio played by the actor Tony Shalhoub. Also particularly fantastic in a film called "Big Night.""	"Wings." And shut up, I like the cab driver. He... slays me.
I didn't care about the abuse. The most amazing thing for me was to watch how Dr. Cox dealt with his friend. How he made him feel safe.	Congratulations! Your Dimaggio-like streak for saying nothing even remotely interesting is still alive and well!
You are such a stud!	Gotcha.
So you used your key to get into my personnel file. Big deal.	Your mother's maiden name is Turner.
How could you possibly know that?	Your first kiss was with Sarah Briggs at the embarrassing age of sixteen. She wore a green turtleneck, and you wonder sometimes if she still thinks about you. I'm guessing no.
Ted, you probably don't notice it yourself, but this hospital is a freak show!	Morning, Dr. Dorian.
That's that's just great.	Hmmmm-mmm!
No, I'm Kimmy!	Oh, uh, am I Kimmy?
Around here, bad news always comes back to haunt you.	Nobody got one.
Dr. Cox, Ben seemed pretty down after you left so I thought I could cover for you and you could go hang out with him.	The periampullary carcinoma patient had a failed palliatitive stenting of the common bile duct so this is what I want to do. I want to go ahead and prep him for a pyloris sparing pancreaticoduodenectomy. Thanks.What's up, T-Man?! Show The Todd some love!
Oh, I don't mind, I just	Well, you're just an absolute lamb but you don't have to do that.
It's funny how people handle bad news in different ways.Some people have a visceral reaction...	Newbie, stop!
Some people go into denial...	Time to get my soapy soap on!
And others...	No way.
...Others just walk away.Chemotherapy looks harmless, but it's really poison pumped directly into your veins.	What chance do you give a guy with Ben's blast percentage, huh? Twenty percent, thirty, maybe? You see, I can't handle that. I cannot. So, no thank you there, Johnny.
The Earth Mover! Can I see?	So where's my Tonka truck?Ha ha! Score!
This is the true story...	I can't believe Perry bailed on you. Typical. He's always out the door if things get too real.
He didn't bail.	And start being realllll!
That's not uncommon.	You're afraid of escalators.
How are you doing this?	You like the way cashmere feels on your skin!
Look, Dr. Cox, I've been doing a lot of thinking and I honestly think that the only reason you're not down at that hospital right now is that you're afraid.	That's right! You run away! Run away from the truth!
You gotta get back in the game, Coxie!Okay, Coxie was a mistake. Pretend I didn't say Coxie.	I think you're right. I do. Partly because you've really... gotten to know me this year.But mostly it's because, well... I told you that I was afraid earlier today so please don't tell me that you've come here to reiterate things to me that I've already said because I know the things I've already said. In fact... I'm the one who said them.
Look, it boggles my mind that you just bail on a patient!	Geeeet out.
I think one of the most universal human experiences is feeling alone. You'd never know it, but there's most likely tons of people feeling the exact same way.Maybe because you're feeling abandoned.Maybe because you realize that you aren't as self-sufficient as you thought.Maybe because you know you should've handled something differently.Or maybe because you aren't as good as you thought you were. Either way, when you hit that low point, you have a choice. You can either wallow in self-pity......Or you can suck it up. It's your call.	No. A patient is a stranger in a bed that you can distance yourself from whenever you need to. Ben is my friend and I'm going to try to get in there to visit him in the next couple of weeks but if I can't... that'll be very sad for me. But really... it will just mean that I'm human. Oh, and newbie? Please don't think that you have come here because Ben needs me. You're here because you're scared to death that you might have to rely on yourself for the first time ever and that... that is just the saddest thing of all.
As for me, I decided that if Dr. Cox couldn't do it, well then I would have to be the one there for Ben.	You're mean.
Well, thank God.	Bum bum bum... when criminals in this world appear and break the laws that they should fear / And frighten all who see or hear / The cry goes up both far and near / For Underdog! / Underdog / Underdog / Underdog / Speed of light, roar of thunder / Fight all who rob or plunder / Underdog! / Ahhhh! Underdog! Underdog!
To most people, it might have seemed like nothing had changed.	You think it's like New York? You know?
But it had a little.	Umm...
As for Ben, he actually responded to the chemo and went into remission. Hopefully, he won't be back, but who knows? Still, that's not what this story's about.It's about the day I realized that admitting we're not heroic is when we're the most heroic of all.	"Joy... and pain!" Here we go, here we go! "And sunshine..." What else? What else? "And rain!" Cut him up! Cut him up!
I guess he'll always be a hero to me.	Now unleash the dog of wonder / Tearing evil, spans asunder! / Underdog / Ahhhh, Underdog! / Underdog...
I haven't even showered yet.	You find it funny, Dr. Dorian? Why don't you tell me the EKG findings of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome?
You know, I never woulda slept with you if you'd told me you were Dr. Cox's ex-wife.	We could shower together for old time's sake.
Uhhh....	What was that, Newbie?
He likes Carla, anyway.	Relax. He doesn't know.
I heard that!	I got Carla wrapped around my finger.
Nothing.	What are you guys talking about?
Forget about it.	Thank you.
All right, enough is enough!Oh!	That's just the kind of thing that can be construed as sexual harassment.You got a few hairs in the sink, there, huh? For God's sake, man, don't comb so hard.
I don't know why my mind is all over the place. Maybe it's because today isn't just any other day; it's my last day as an intern.	I guess I don't fit in with your mirror friends. Enjoy.
Ahhh!	Ohhh, you got me! Lemme go, lemme go, lemme go, lemme go!
What the hell, he deserves it, too.	Let's get our last day on!
Mo	What the hell, he deserves it, too.
I'll see what I can do. Hey, how come you haven't mentioned it's my last day as an intern?	Oh, come on what the hell, Newbie. This gentleman is suffering from an inflamed gallbladder, and you actually have him eating a grilled-cheese sandwich. Hhhere's an idea: why don't we just have him wash the whole thing down with a big ol' mug of vodka.Mr. Bober, back there, is one of our frequent flyers; he's been with us every six months for the last two years, and I've grown rather fond of him. So if you could somehow manage to not kill him, well then - oh, gee that would just be ducky.
Nuh-uh.	Haven't I?
Okay.	Come here!
Why is he so uptight today?	Despite the fact that when you wake up tomorrow morning you will be a resident, you'll still be the same excitable little girl that you are right now; the only difference will be that some sorry new intern will probably mistake you for somebody who actually knows something.
Oh, okay.	Hey, Perry.
Carla.... Can you do me a favor? This Mr. Bober needs to get another Foley catheter - I am so swamped.	And I don't think
When a couple gets in an argument, you should run for it before you get roped in.	I know we're not finished yet! See, I didn't say we were finished yet.... But, really, baby, it's up to you.
Careful, tiger. Careful.	I did not say "get"! You're being ridiculous. What do you think, J.D.?
I wish people would call me "tiger."	Careful, tiger. Careful.
I agree with Laverne!	What?
Don't worry about it; somebody else'll get it.	Well, maybe if you tell him how hard it is on you, he'll get better!I'll get paper towel.
I was gonna say something, but, it turns out, he gave me a pretty good idea.	Yeah. Who can we get? I'm not shocked, that's how you live your life, isn't it? Got a problem? Hey, just pass it on down the line....
Thank you so much for taking Bober from me.	I was gonna say something, but, it turns out, he gave me a pretty good idea.
I owe you.	But, J.D., I just
Still, Elliot wasn't gonna let herself get stuck with Mr. Bober, either.	Ah, I know; and I'm sure you have a cool "Jungle Party" t-shirt to prove it. Now, can we please finish this physical? And, I can't pee right now, so you'll have to go for me.What a good girl. Good girl.
Look, we can stand here and argue all day about who screwed who	Hey, it was J.D.'s patient! I was just the middleman.... -Woman.... -Person.
Or nothing, I'm on break - let's do it.	Or?
Fine, loser gets Bober.	Okay, Rock-Paper-Scissors, right now.
That's right. We all agree we did nothing wrong; so let's just check in on him and forget about it.	Yeah. I mean, we were just joking around. I mean, our only mistake was not being careful about where we were.
And that's when the three of us realized, even though we'd all spent time with Mr. Bober, none of us had any idea what he looked like.	That's right. We all agree we did nothing wrong; so let's just check in on him and forget about it.
You guys, we have to do something. If we remove Mr. Bober's gallbladder, it should relieve the recurrent abdominal pain.	What's wrong, dawg?
And then, all at once, we realized we had to do something. We decided to attack the problem on three fronts.	Problem is, he has no insurance.
Dr. Cox.	And then, all at once, we realized we had to do something. We decided to attack the problem on three fronts.
So I thought if you looked at Mr. Bober's chart, and and you agreed with us, you might be able to, you know, pull some strings, er....	Dr. Wen.
And now, here it comes - the calling me a girl's name, the telling me not to waste my time....	So I thought if you looked at Mr. Bober's chart, and and you agreed with us, you might be able to, you know, pull some strings, er....
I was half right.	Yeah. I'll be more than glad to help you, there, Charlotte.
W-well, th thank you!	I was half right.
Are you dying?	Don't ever be afraid to come to me with stuff like that. The simple fact that you actually seem to give a crap is the reason I took an interest in you to begin with. It's why I trust you as a doctor. Hell, it's...it's why I trust you as a person.
Aw, just say it.	I've got a new shrink.
You know, Dr. Cox, I wanna thank you for this whole year	Aw, just say it.
And I just wanna know...if I can buy you dinner.	Oh, no, no, no...no.
Great! I'm off in, like, a half hour	That'd be terrific.
Would have been nice.	Oh, no. Here, I was led to believe that you were doing a gift certificate kind of thing. But, to sit and eat...with you, that's-that's just...that's crazy talk! I have half a mind to issue you a drug test. I mean, come on, what'd I sign up for
Did he just say "fiscal"?	Right but, what if...we were to look at this from a purely...fiscal perspective.
How the hell we supposed to get that?	You get used to it. Boys, I'll do what I can, but if you're gonna pull this off, you're gonna need a board member behind you.
Help!?! You were awful to me! You-you-you-you-Awful!	Hey, congratulations on becoming a resident. Glad I could help.
It's been a long year, but the important thing is we all got through it together. We were a family.	Hear, hear.
Oh, Ms. Sullivan, thank you for helping us with Mr. Bober.	Hey everyone.
Oh, please God, no.	Carla, my ex-husband is in love with you. It's true. Ask your boyfriend, he knows; he and Perry talk about it all the time. I don't know why you haven't mentioned this to her! Perhaps you're afraid of something? Huh. And Bob? When are you gonna tell Perry that that promotion you're making him jump through hoops for? was filled months ago! It just seems wrong. Which brings us to Twinkie. If you don't have the courage to tell your 'colleague' Dr. Dorian that you're still crazy about him, I'm gonna go ahead and do it for ya, 'cause that's what friends do. Yeah! And finally, Perry, you are not gonna believe what happened the first time I met your little protégé, here....
Yep. One big, happy family.	I slept with him... and it was good - oh! How's that for stirring things up? Have a great summer, everyone. Bye!
Noooooooooooooooooo!	Carla, my ex-husband is in love with you. It's true. Ask your boyfriend, he knows; he and Perry talk about it all the time.Huh. And Bob? When are you gonna tell Perry that that promotion you're making him jump through hoops for? was filled months ago!Which brings us to Twinkie.If you don't have the courage to tell your 'colleague' Dr. Dorian that you're still crazy about him, I'm gonna go ahead and do it for ya, 'cause that's what friends do. Yeah!And finally: Perry, you are not gonna believe what happened the first time I met your little protégé, here....!
Of course, I've been wrong before.	Good morning, Tiger.
How could you let a woman kick you out of your own bed?	Of course, I've been wrong before.
This is unacceptable. You said we were gonna sleep head-to-foot.	Baby, why you have to be so cranky in the morning?
Yeah, but with the head-to-foot alignment, it's just there's no way for them to lock in.	Dude, either way the naughty bits are still in the middle.
Ugh. I'm not!Ready to go?Morning, boy.	Could you be more homophobic?
Rowdy, no.	I can't remember the last time I was in this foul a mood.
I hate it that everything is so messed up between all of us, you know?	Babe....?
I had my shoes on, it would have been impossible to lock in.	Well, just remember what I said to you this morning in bed.
I'm cool. I'm cool.	Everything's gonna be fine. Okay? Just be cool.
What?	I can't get to sleep / I think about the implications....
Oh, God!	Night after night my heartbeat shows the fear....Ghosts appear and fade away....
Just keep it down.Shh!	Come back another day....
Uhhh....	I can't get to sleep / I think about the implications....Of diving in too deep / And possibly the complications....
Hey, Elliot....	It's just overkill.Day after day it reappears....
Nightie-night.	Night after night my heartbeat shows the fear....Ghosts appear and fade away.......Ghosts appear and fade away.....
Ah, that's that's very clever...it looks like I wet myself. Do you actually think that that's funny?	Whoa.... Looks like someone switched to big-boy pants a little too soon.
Good God, that's cold!	Yeah!
Could I have Mr. Buckley's chart, please?	What are you smiling at?
And just like that, it was my turn to face the music.	Oh, uh, that's the sound of all the bees in your bonnet. And, Perry, even though I could give a rat's ass, I still think it's a pretty sound!
Steady now.... Be brave.... Don't cry.	And just like that, it was my turn to face the music.
What the hell?	Good morning!
Woo!	Dr. Dorian.
Ooh! Is that my new nickname? 'Cause, you know, I actually thought people were gonna start calling me that in high school when I was in our production of 'The Wiz'....Yeah, it was the sort of the "hip" version of 'The Wizard of Oz'.... Nipsey Russell played the TinMan? "Come on and ease on down, ease on down the road!" Remember that? No? Well, anyway, you know, kids can be mean and everyone just started calling me "Dorothy." ...High school was hard....	Here you go, whiz-kid.
Uh...yeah, sir, I have a full patient load; I don't understand that you just drop this guy in my lap and expect me to make him a top priority.	Oh, I'm sorry, sport; I was thinking about soup. Now, Mr. Zerbo was initially admitted with a high fever and suspected meningitis; but, both the NCT and the lumbar puncture came back negative.
Neurology, rheumatology, hematology.... This guy's been turfed to every service in the hospital, no one knows what's wrong with him, what do you want me to do?	You want me to say "ta da!" so it seems more like a trick? Mr. Zerbo back there is a major hospital benefactor. And, by golly, you know it's a lot harder to write a big, fat check if you're dead.
Dr. Kelso....	I hope it's navy bean today.
'Kay, fine! You know.... After all, I'm I'm the Whiz Kid!	Well, gee, sport! I would say you should stop whining, find out what's wrong with him, and treat it; or you can be damn sure I'm going to give you something to whine about.
Once you're a resident here, you get a decent locker. Still, it's a co-ed room, so if you need to change.......you do it fast.	Don't stain 'em.
Dude! That was, like, some sort of record, or something!	Once you're a resident here, you get a decent locker. Still, it's a co-ed room, so if you need to change.......you do it fast.
I had planned to avoid Dr. Cox all day; but, unfortunately, I needed his help.	Bueno.
Dr. Cox, I have this, uh, patient, Mr. Zerbo, I can't quite	I had planned to avoid Dr. Cox all day; but, unfortunately, I needed his help.
Who knows.... Maybe he just decided to let the whole ex-wife thing go.	Dr. Cox, I have this, uh, patient, Mr. Zerbo, I can't quite
All negative.	Auto-immune serologies?
Then again, maybe he's just letting me stew for a while.	All negative.
Negative.	Bone-marrow biopsy?
What kind of man tortures people like this!?!	Negative.
Okay, fine: I'm sorry I slept with your ex-wife!	Afraid you got yourself a toughie.
It was an accident.	I think I'll sit back down.
A little scary Sorry! Jitters!	Look.... First of all, it's not like you tripped and fell into her...and then out of her...and then into her...again. And, second of all, you're smart enough to know that I don't want to talk about this; I don't want to know where you did it; I don't even want to know...how it was.
And here come the fireworks....	A little scary Sorry! Jitters!
Cool!	Lookit: I know you didn't have any idea who she was, and I understand why you were too nervous to tell me. So, whatta ya say we leave it at that? I forgive you; you are forgiven. Okay?
Did you find it?	I'm not I'm not hiding! Um...I just I w I was just looking for my, um...you know the....I was...looking for my dignity.
Oh, for God's sakes, would you throw her a rope?	No.I must have left it at college.
I have no idea how to treat this patient. Help me out.	Oh, for God's sakes, would you throw her a rope?
Now, she's in a really awkward place; so just be sensitive.	I have no idea how to treat this patient. Help me out.
I think we should sex each other.	Now, she's in a really awkward place; so just be sensitive.
Just hear me out: Our relationship ended so quickly, maybe too quickly, you know? And, now there's like these these feelings floating around, and I feel like we're always gonna regret it if we don't...see if they lead somewhere.What do you think?I can't believe how weird it feels to be back here again.	I'm sorry?
If Carla's so mad, I don't understand why she doesn't just crash at her own place.	Yeah.... But it seems so right.
What are you talking about, Willis?	Oh, she is back at her place.
Yeah, I know.	That's pretty funny!We should make that one of our things.
Yeah. You know what's weird, though? It's like, Dr. Cox and I are pretty vegan-kosher.	I think I'd really panic if she went back to her place.J.D., this sucks.
No.	He hasn't yelled at you?
Mm-mm.	This is the guy that screamed on you for like twenty minutes for dropping a thermometer? And he hasn't raised his voice once about you bumping uglies with his ex-wife?
And that's when I realized something....	I don't get that guy.
Uh...I must have misplaced my pager.	Hey, where you been? I paged you twice.
The reason Dr. Cox wasn't yelling at me like he used to...	Uh...I must have misplaced my pager.
...he didn't care about me anymore.	Huh. Probably ought to try and find that.
What the hell are you doing?	Hello, boys.
Do these help?	This is how The Todd gets his self-esteem on.
Hey.	Uncool!You look totally hot, Mirror Todd.
You know, Elliot, I think we should talk about the sexual tension	Hey.
Awesome!	There is no sexual tension, okay!Just...go ahead and look before your neck snaps.
And the and the sexual tension.	J.D., the problem is this place. I mean, when we broke up, I had to see you the next day...and the next day. And we never...got any distance from the relationship. I never got...to move on, you know?
Is it starting to burn?!	It gets better!
Be that as it may, I think there are some simple solutions. Dr. Cox, you're angry with me.	Bambi, you paged us here.
And you won't admit this, but you're in love with Carla.	No, I'm not.
And Carla, you're mad that Turk didn't trust you enough to tell you.	You're starting again.
Whatever. The point is that Turk is sorry.	See? Trust, woman, trust!
Can we just try and stay focused	You're not in love with me, you idealize me.
If we could just refrain from name calling	You should be glad I never took our relationship for granted, you silly woman!
Aren't you glad we did this?	Okay, that's it! Now, I have killed for so much less than that, and I'll damn-sure do it again unless you all shut the hell up right now and I MEAN NOW!
Oh, my God rounds!	I'm going out for Mexican food tonight. And I'll see you in bed, my friend.
Rounds started five minutes ago, and I totally forgot about Mr. Zerbo! Oh, my God...Oh, my God...Oh, my God	The Hall
Ow!	Are you plannin' on makin' this worth my while?
Think, Whiz Kid, think!Ah, the hell with it.	Dr. Dorian? How 'bout you step up to the mic and tell the entire gang how you ended up treating Mr. Zerbo.
Sir, I did nothing.	Think, Whiz Kid, think!Ah, the hell with it.
Nothing at all.	You did...nothing?
Huh?	Great job, sport!
Oh, no problem.	Thank you, doctor.
It's funny.... I guess sometimes when you do nothing at all, things just have a way of fixing themselves.	Oh, no problem.
Ahhh. It's good to be home.......Sort of.	Yeah, ya do.Do you know how I know that this is yours, Farrah? 'Cause when I paged you earlier, someone found it next to a can of Fresca and a dog-eared copy of Teen People magazine. Anyway long story, short: The whole incident gave me a bang-up idea; because, you see, I've got tomorrow off. So I'm gonna be on my couch, sipping on some scotch and paging you every twenty seconds. And if you don't answer every damn last one of 'em, I'm gonna shove this thing so far down your throat it's gonna make you take a tinkle every time it goes off. Big fun, right?You're gonna need this.Oh!Oh!Let it come. Let it Oh! Let it come!
No he doesn't.	Oh, right.... But then the lion kills him anyway. Yeah.
You know, "Sandy" isn't necessarily a girls' name.	Sandy, whatta ya say we start our work day.
Clear.	It's short for "Sandra".
Oh, God. The ex-wife.	Hello, Perry.
Remember, I had no idea she was your ex at the time.	Mm-hmm. Say, let's play a game: I'll throw out an adjective describing how one of you is in bed, and you guys try to guess who it is!
No worries.	Don't answer that, Newbie.
Ow!	Goodbye, Jordan. Sandy.
You know, it's J.D. Okay? And at least I remember the names of all my sexual partners.	Good job, D.J.
It was Camp Meadow Wood. ...I made a lanyard.	Well, I'm sure that girl from high school and your bunk-mate from Camp Morning Wood are both extremely grateful. Yeah.
Maybe Hank....	Hey, J.D., do you think anyone else gets this excited over a car accident?
We weren't the only ones psyched to be in the game.	Maybe Hank....
There's nothing like that feeling of really taking charge of a situation.	But don't worry, we're on top of it, okay?
You know that was...kind of demeaning.	I mean like a glazed thingie. And I like sprinkles on half of it; so if you can't find a half sprinkled, get me all sprinkles and just go ahead and pick half of 'em off.
The frustrating thing was, down in the OR, Turk was probably running the show.	You know, you're right. Would you do me a favor and apologize to her while you get me some coffee. And please be quick, otherwise I'm just gonna have the manager send over a different waitress. Go. You're done now. Yeah.
I think we just have to accept the fact that we're the most under-appreciated people at this hospital.	I scratched my nose with Bad Guy's toe.
Thank you!	Oh, Bambi, I really feel for you.
It's actually not that bad. And the lace feels soft against my package.	J.D., I spend most of my time here getting orders barked at me by people who take credit for my work and blame me for their mistakes. And all the while, I'm expected to hold the doctor's hand. You should try trading places with me for one day.
Nah.	It's actually not that bad. And the lace feels soft against my package.
I'm not gay.	Tim.
Unfortunately, I'm on-call tonight, and as weird as this place is during the day...it's even worse at night. See, that's when all the weirdos come out.Like the ER doctor who likes to work nights 'cause he says he's up anyway.	Huh? Oh! Oh.... I get it. Neither is Tim.
Or the nurse who everyone agrees is just a little bit off.Or, if there's a full moon....	Hey, bro.
Ted, I know, you told me last time that we	Hey. This is my band. We all work in different departments in the hospital.
Hey, you got promoted!	On-site property management including pest control, night-time security, non-arboreal gardening services, and tenant-related easements and liens.
Oh, yeah, I remember, the uh cartoon theme songs.	Dr. Kelso lets us practice here at night.
Hey. So, what attendings are stuck here on-call tonight?	No, no, no. That was lame. We do prime-time now.
Well, I'm "Carol", so yes.	Is Carol the one with the really firm butt?
Oh, come on. You guys are missing the point: No one is here tonight but us, we are running this hospital.	It's disturbing how obsessed you are with your own butt.
I love my butt!	We're in charge!
It's amazing how one moment you think you know exactly what you want....	I love my butt!
...And then the next moment, everything changes.	Oh, God. Come on.
Never actually...done one of these unsupervised before.	Okay, Elliot: The ER doctor knows there's no attending up here, so instead of treating-&-streeting people, he's just admitting everyone. You've got twelve so far.Turk: Oncology, Cardiology, and Pediatrics all need surgical consults...plusThat phone is for you. It's the clinic they, too, know you're on your own so they're just patching all their night calls right on through.And Bambi: Room 201 needs an art-line, Room 202 needs reintubation; plus, Carol, you're needed in ICU to place a femoral swan under flu on Mr. Freed.
And that's when I realized, tonight we really were all alone running the hospital.	Never actually...done one of these unsupervised before.
No, Carla. I'm the doctor. I should tell them.	Look, you've all been on-call before. So, you don't have a safety-net. Most of the time you don't need one, anyway, right?Fine. I'll just go tell your patients that they're on their own because you're all too scared.
That, my friends, is one nerdy honky!	Come on, peeps! Let's go kick some sick patient ass!
I'm gonna need a c-arm in here!	Hm!?
What are you doing in here?	Want me to knock him out?
This this isn't like being a janitor, okay! It's not just like something everybody can do.	I owe ya. I'm helping you out.
YES!	Oh. So you can do my stuff, but I can't do yours.
I don't know, the...rough side of a sponge?	Okay, hotshot, what would you use to get a coffee stain up off a tile floor?
Ahh, the classic Catch-22 between Medical and Surgical. Bottom-line, somebody needs to be decisive.	Yeah, but his vitals are so weak, I wouldn't feel confident about taking him to the OR.
Okay, here's the plan: We do nothing.	Ahh, the classic Catch-22 between Medical and Surgical. Bottom-line, somebody needs to be decisive.
We'll meet back here in a few hours and see if his vitals have improved.	That's inspiring.
Turk should've known that the worst mistake a doctor can possibly make is setting foot in the hospital's free clinic at night.	Yeah. This ends now.
It's really neither here nor there.	You put it up there.
Thank God.	Fine. All right, we're even.
Okay, I want that, then.	You know you could have just asked me to stop hassling you for, like, a year?
But I...use those...for listening.	It's too late.
His vitals are exactly the same. There's gotta be one attending in this stupid hospital.	Oh, uh, they want you upstairs in room, um, 208.
It's on my to-do list.	You all claim you want more responsibility.... But you're being outsmarted by a doctor who wears scrubs made out of hemp; you're afraid to stand up to a volunteer who's answering the clinic phones; and Bambi, did you ever place that femoral swan?
We all knew what we had to do.	Now I know you're all hoping Officer Berson's vitals will go up or down and this decision will be made for you, but guess what? Nothing's changed. So it's on you.
Surgery.	We all knew what we had to do.
Sometimes, just making a decision is half the battle.	Surgery.
Sometimes, we're our own worst enemy.And sometimes, we rise to the occasion.	Thank you, thank you.
Everything went, uh, really well.	Sometimes, we're our own worst enemy.And sometimes, we rise to the occasion.
Even though we all know that tomorrow morning, the three of us'll go back to being the most unappreciated people in the whole damn hospital.	Everything went, uh, really well.
I'll give you a hand.	Me too, babe?
When you spend most of your time together as a part of a group, if you're left alone, it can get pretty awkward. There can be...uncomfortable silences.	I'll give you a hand.
Still, it's nothing compared to the silence you can hear at work.	Uh...
There aren't many things that can make the Chief of Medicine move that fast. But whenever we get a patient who has the same name as a wing of the hospital, you can pretty much predict Kelso's behavior.	Well, that's just great, sport; I'm sure you'll see them over Christmas.Criminy.
I'm sorry, what?	Or the one in the corner who can't seem to stop daydreaming.
Wait. Is that easy to manage?	Scram.
Zipped, schmipped.Oh, I thought we were riffing.	Yak, schmack, the lips stay zipped.
Wow. She had some real old-fashioned sass. I mean, you just don't see sass like that anymore.	Careful, there, sweet-cheeks. I haven't decided which way I'm going to take your temperature yet.
Sass.	Stop saying sass.
I felt I knew the right answer.	Gosh, I'm sorry, nervous guy, but I just can't do your work for you. But, what do you say you head on down to the library and look it up in the New England Journal of Who Gives a Rat's Ass? You've got to leave this instant - this second - this moment. Just go.Boy. Now tell me this, muffin: You're not gonna be like all the other mindless drones trying to turn the sniffles into something much more fascinating just so you're the one who's selected to go to this stupid conference, are you?
No...?	I felt I knew the right answer.
Look, muffin, I'm not gonna run around this hospital like the rest of you mindless drones trying to turn the sniffles into something fascinating just so you can go to some stupid conference.... Schmonference.	So...have you found any cool cases yet?
It's fun to rhyme!	Look, muffin, I'm not gonna run around this hospital like the rest of you mindless drones trying to turn the sniffles into something fascinating just so you can go to some stupid conference.... Schmonference.
Front butt.... It's like the grail.	Bravo! Bravo!
Don't get sucked in!	Oh, did you say something, Mr. Too Scared To Get In The Game?
You know, I have an interesting patient, too.So, basically, Mr. Davis, you received a blunt trauma to the fibrous tissue of the corpus cavernosum.	Don't get sucked in!
You broke your penis.	Great, and that means....?
I-I gotta tell you, it's such an unusual case.... Would you mind if I try and get it published in a medical journal?	Wow. I can't wait to get my cast signed.
I'll let you...mull it over. And smile, Mr. Davis - tomorrow's gonna be a better day...for everyone.	That would be fantastic!
For how long?	Hey, do me a favor: Hold my place in line.
Well, why? What do you have to do?	Uhh, I don't know.
No, seriously, try me I can deal with anything.	Nothin'. Might just veg.
"Go aschmay."	Go away.
"Eat _schmit_ and die."	Angie. Put on your flats, we're going for a walk.
Around here, life can be full of surprises. Some are as simple as forgetting something you were supposed to ask for....	"Eat _schmit_ and die."
Some are so unexpected that everything else takes a back-seat.	Dr. Kelso! Is he gone?
And some you never thought you'd hear.	I'm getting big, fake breasts.
I know.	Listen, Newbie, I don't tell you I respect you a lot because, well, I don't.
This is great! There's only one problem.	Anyway, let's make pretend it's your birthday or something, because I'm...ah, hell, I'm impressed.Let's get some coffee.
You see, ten minutes ago....	This is great! There's only one problem.
I'm goin' to Reno! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!	What the hell. Go ahead and use me in your case report.
Not about Reno.	Beg your pardon, Newbie? What are ya thinkin'?
It's out of mop gas?	The reason I wanted you to stand in line for me is 'cause I needed a new mop. See, the floors are all slippery 'cause this one doesn't work. You know why it doesn't work?
Something in that filthy mop water woke me up. I decided I could have my cake and eat it, too.Dr. Cox would never know.	No. 'Cause it's so old it won't soak up water.See?
But don't worry - Dr. Cox and I never say die!Unless, of course, someone actually dies; then we're kind of forced to by law.	Your abdominal pain suggests you have biliary disease, but all your tests came back negative so...we don't exactly know what's wrong with you.
"The kid"? This is great.	Ohh, come on, the kid's okay.
Well, I've only been here a year, and he's actually just started calling me "The Kid" - which I love, by the way.	So, why haven't I heard your name before?
Okay.	She's talking to me, pumpkin.
Uncomfortable....	Oh, I could do naughty things to that man.
Nothing, sir. I don't want anything from you, ever.	And you?
Well, sir, I	You know, that's what my son always says. But then when Mother's Day rolls around, guess who wants me to go halvsies on a pasta pot for Enid?
You can't just change your mind!	She's not _my_ mother, dammit!Oh. And don't think that I've forgotten that you have yet to turn in a case report. You have until six.
Crap.	Oh, I'm sorry. Did I pass out from the pain in my penis and suddenly we're not in America anymore?
'Cause I, uh, thought it would be nice. Why, don't you like it?Well?	Yeah, I got that. I mean why'd you get it for me?
No.	Your stomach acid is eroding your own intestines. It's remarkable - I've never actually seen anything like it before. Newbie, you?
And that's when I realized Mrs. Warner was the most interesting case in the hospital.	No.
I just had to go for it.	Whole thing's very treatable. We're gonna step outside, and then we'll get underway - how's that sound?Newbie, whatta you say?
Actually, if you could just give me a second, I want to ask Mrs. Warner something.	I just had to go for it.
To marry me.	What?
Mrs. Warner, I was wondering if you'd give me permission to present your case to possibly be published in a national medical journal, so that I might be chosen to go to an AMA conference.	Come on - heel, toe - whatta you say, kid?
Thanks.Excuse me.	Sure. Why not.
You know, I don't care what you think.	Congratulations. You get to represent the Kelso Kennel Club at the big show in Reno. Just remember, when you are posing and prancing in front of the judges, to keep that shaved behind of yours held up nice and high like the proud little puppy that you are. Then when it comes time to hand out those blue ribbons, it'll be such an exciting time for you - it really will be - but for the love of God, Newbie, you gotta try, try, try not to squeeze out a dookie on the astroturf. Because, uh, I mean, God forbid you were ever an embarrassment to Master Bob, right?
I know.Look, I wanna be like you...but a more successful you. There's nothing wrong with playing the game once in a while.Tell you what: Ten years form now, when I'm your boss, I'll go ahead and throw in a good word for you and you won't even have to ask........sir.	Yeah, you do.
I like to think that your life comes down to the choices you've made along the way.Like standing up to a superior.Or the choice to focus on what you have in common, instead of what you don't.Or the choice to let someone help you, for once.In the end, you just have to trust your decisions.	I know.Look, I wanna be like you...but a more successful you. There's nothing wrong with playing the game once in a while.Tell you what: Ten years form now, when I'm your boss, I'll go ahead and throw in a good word for you and you won't even have to ask........sir.
And hopefully, you'll land on solid ground	You're the husband? We've gotta get you some bigger hands.
Well what about your new mop?!	And hopefully, you'll land on solid ground
But you cried!	I like the old one.
Glup.That's a good one.	No, that was you.
Well, you'll need a tin-foil hat to hold in all your thoughts.	So, what, I'm gonna start acting all crazy or something?
Well....	But I can still have a tiny, little bite of my wife's carne asada, right?
The greatest thing about Carla is I always know I can count on her to be the bad cop.	Well....
Carla!	Well, I just thought that
We're a team.	That's right.
"Eat-may" sounds like "eat me."	What?
Of course, on some teams, there's gonna be friction.	"Eat-may" sounds like "eat me."
And some teams, well, they never really seem to get together.	Mmm. That's nice...beeyotch.
She's trying to ask you a question.	And there it is again that ringing in my ears. It's kind of an "Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!" but it's more piercing, more of an "Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!"
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!	Can you believe that!? I mean, every time we even try to talk to him, he starts going off on one of these random tangents and....
Clearly we're on the same page.	You know?
Maybe if you wore your hair up?	We're residents now, we should be treated more like colleagues, and I can't even get him to notice me.Oh, God! Oh! Uh! Sorry, sorry, sorry!
Nothing. What. Is. Up. With. You...Man?	Be careful here.... Don't give him anything.
Sad?	I always get this way in the fall, you know summer's gone, the days are shorter; it just makes me feel so...what's the word....
Let me explain, I	Yes, that's it. I'm a janitor, so I couldn't think of the word "sad." I was gonna say, It makes me feel so "mop."
Maybe I shouldn't bother.	Go ahead, I'm "mopping."
I guess after a while, you just stop being surprised by people.	Maybe you "mopn't."
I didn't know you had a brother.	Oh, cool.
That is adorable. Do you think he'd mind if I call him that, too?	That's my pet-name for Turk you know, 'cause he's mine and he's a black man: "My bruthah."
I know. I'm still gonna ask. So, how come I don't know anything about your family?	J.D., I was kidding.
But you know everything about me. You even know I have them switch Lauren's shifts so we always end up working together.	I don't know. I g I'm just not big on sharing my personal life with people.
Wow.	Okay, I'm _leaving_ now.
I know, it's so unfair.I'm mad about it.	Another Friday night? That's three in a row!
Not entirely unlike a...ninja!	I think you should give Bonnie a break. You know, it's really hard being a woman around here...you can walk through walls and nobody notices you.
Catch you later, my bruthah!	Whatever. I'm out.
He said "Holla."	I'll holla.
Rough day, huh? Well, maybe it would help to share...with someone?	Atta boy.
I think I can handle it.	Okay. You want in? You want me to open up?
Wow.	Fine!I don't like the way I look. I don't like the way I think. I don't like the way I feel about how I look. ...I have too much hair, my boobs are too low, my butt is too big, and I'm so short!Plus, when I work up this morning, I cried for like half an hour because I thought I was getting wrinkles, but it turns out I just fell asleep on Turk's corduroy pants!
No I don't.	Dr. Cox let me tell a woman that her husband's dying!
What, Turk and Bonnie? They hate each other.	You see, that's what's really bothering me.
He's not! That's his "In your face" dance.... Or it's his "There's a sale on lotion" dance. I dunno; he's got so many dances.	Then why is he doing his "You're so getting a piece of this" dance?
Carla! Trust me, there's no way that he's cheating on you.	Please, they might as well be naked. Slut.
Wait, that's it? You were just freakin' out.	Yeah, you're probably right.
Crazy!	Hey, you wanted in!
Oh, thank God.	J.D.!
A lot happens in the cafeteria.... Whether you've just accidentally stolen your lunch....Or you've finally gotten someone to notice you....Or you've connected with a friend on a level you didn't know you could.The cafeteria is just a happy place.	Oh, thank God.
What's wrong with him?	A lot happens in the cafeteria.... Whether you've just accidentally stolen your lunch....Or you've finally gotten someone to notice you....Or you've connected with a friend on a level you didn't know you could.The cafeteria is just a happy place.
Oh, no.	I can't believe you think I got a thing for her.
Hey, when did you guys learn sign language!?Night classes? Wait, when did _I_ learn sign language?	Mm-hmm.
A little can...a very tiny, small can.	J.D. said you're a big ol' can o' crazy.
Okay, you can fix this.	Horrible, horrible death. Horrible, horrible death. Horrible, horrible death....
Carla, look, I messed up and I'm so sorry.	Okay, you can fix this.
Ah, thank you!	Bambi. We're good, okay? We're pals!
I'm so sorry. Does this mean you're married?	I missed my baby's first steps!
Dude, why would you get turkey when there's egg salad?	Well, welcome aboard.
Well, I could've spent the rest of my life with Lauren! ...Or at least with her tushie. I just want to wash it is that weird?	Even. I told a nurse you switched her shifts you babbled all my crazy to the person I plan on spending the rest of my life with!
Come on....	You think this is funny?
Well, don't walk away! Carla...come on.	I told you how hard it is for me to let my guard down, and that quick, you burn me. Never again.
All right, look: Okay, I never meant to insinuate you guys were stupid, all right? Everyone knows you're a hundred times smarter than the jackasses that run this place.	Hello??!!?? For the love of God! Hello???!!!
No, sir. It's not so. Ooh..Would you just go ahead and answer it, already! Hello?	Is that so, sport?
Will you lay off Mr. Hogan? So he made a mistake, all right, people make mistakes. When they do, it wouldn't hurt you to cut them some slack once in a while.	That's it, I've I've had enough. This is ridiculous.
Quiet; this isn't about you! Don't eat meat!Carla! Look, every time you screwed up with me, I've totally let you off the hook.	Thanks, man.
Okay, never. But we both know that if you ever did, I would give you a break. Now let's see how you like it when I walk away from you.Actually, I need to go this way.Right the first time.	When have I ever screwed up with you?
I think every day is made up of tiny little tests.Some are tests of character.Some are tests of fortitude.Others are tests of friendship.	Barbie, as long as you stay and work at this hospital, I'm always gonna be your superior.... That's just the way it goes. Don't get me wrong, you can keep trying to connect with me; I mean, hell, you're...you're so damn entertaining you just might make some head-way. But still, you might be better served and, this is a crazy notion if you could stop worrying so much about who does and doesn't notice...you. Even for a second...that'd be good; that'd be real good.
Really?	I spoke to my brother today.
And if you're lucky, when it really matters, you'll pass with flying colors.	Mm-hmm. He's having some problems.
That still doesn't change the fact that you're gonna be fine!	I work here.
'Cause I'm a doctor.	Why...in the hell are you wearing a coat?
Well, I look doctorly!	Look, Babs, if you're truly worried about people seeing your ass, just go ahead and do what all the other girls do and tie a sweater around your waist.
Where did you come from!?	I was in the military.
Coat-wearing doctors do not take this crap.	If I find out you're wearing a bronzie, without having served, I'm gonna make things uncomfortable for you.
You were never in the military.	Coat-wearing doctors do not take this crap.
Which branch?	Yes, I was.
I'm watching you.That's right, Sasquatch.	The...janitor branch.
You see, things have changed.We've begun to adapt to new situations.	I'm watching you.That's right, Sasquatch.
Most importantly, we've started to treat each other with respect.	Ohhh, sweet baby James.
I think I look spiffy. I'm trying to separate myself from the whole pack.	Dude, you are such a loser, man.
You're gonna want to be careful about yelling that out in a bar.	Oh, do me! Do me! Do me!
Yeah, you are.	The whitest.
I ain't hearin' that, woman, 'cause I'm talkin' to him.	Oh, come on, J.D.'s white!
T. Diddy?	Okay, it's a tie.
Oh, yeah. It's spiffy!	Sharp coat, sport.
Think you really got through to him.Oh, my God, you hear like a bat!	Ha! Ha! Ha! Too slow!
Idiot! I wish I had a guy in my life that would stop me before I did something stupid.I don't know why he's an opera singer.	Think you really got through to him.Oh, my God, you hear like a bat!
And then, I did something I've never done before....	Listen closely, Tiny Dancer: I wouldn't be flapping my mouth if I'd forgotten to get a blood culture on Mr. Blair. And, for the love of God, do you at least remember what you were doing the day they were passing out common sense? Oh, gosh, maybe you were running late that day 'cause you just couldn't find the right thong for those low-rider jeans that you love so much, or maybe you were busy bopping along to whatever boy band really makes your heart race nowadays, and you just drove on by. 'Course, I don't know, I'm just guessing, but one things' sure-shootin': you wound up at the dumb-dumb store and you just went ahead and put so much of that into the car that you could fit, didn't ya?
Look, Doctor: If you flip the page on that chart, you'd see that I pan-cultured him yesterday; but that would probably get in the way of the perverse pleasure you take in pointing out other peoples' slip-ups. Well, too bad, Buster Brown! Because I'm a resident now, and I'm not gonna be making the same little silly intern mistakes I made last year. I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't stand here and yell at me in front of my patient.	And then, I did something I've never done before....
"Buster Brown."	"Buster Brown."
Focus all energy on lip not quivering.Wow!	"Buster Brown."
Domo arigato, Dr. Amato.How is that not funny?	Oh, that's great, Dr. Amato.
You know, you guys are getting to be like Starsky and Hutch.	I don't know, dude.
I would watch that show.	That'd be true if Starsky was a ventriloquist and Hutch was a tiny puppet.
Why do you keep ending up with that guy?	Yeah.
Oh, what, ending up with Dr. Amato is like a punishment or something?	Because the other surgeons are busting my chops for skipping guys' night out.
Check that out.	No, dude; I actually enjoy needing you to lower me on the toilet in the morning.
I know it looks innocent, but Elliot was late this morning. Plus, once you've been here a while, you learn to read between the lines.	Check that out.
Mmm?	I know it looks innocent, but Elliot was late this morning. Plus, once you've been here a while, you learn to read between the lines.
Mr. Blair, that infection keeps hanging around so I wanna put you on a broader spectrum antibiotic that we'll administer intravenously.	Not enough.
I'm gonna tell you something my mom used to tell me whenever I was scared: In the case of severe sinus infection not responding to a three-day cycle of antibiotics, the recommended protocol is Imipenem, 500 milligrams, I.V.q. six hours. Got me through a lot of hard times.	But I'm feeling a lot better.
I love it that Mr. Blair trusted me. It's one of the best feelings you can have as a doctor.	I'm gonna tell you something my mom used to tell me whenever I was scared: In the case of severe sinus infection not responding to a three-day cycle of antibiotics, the recommended protocol is Imipenem, 500 milligrams, I.V.q. six hours. Got me through a lot of hard times.
You can't wear that!	How's it goin'?
You know what I mean!	What, you mean after Labor Day? Eh.
Jerk!	It's a white coat. Anybody can wear a white coat.
Puppet gun. They'd sew it to its hand.	Does it have a real gun or a puppet gun?
I don't care what hospital you go to, Surgery is still a boys' club.	Okay, I'd watch that.What's up, fellas!
I'm just as cool as those guys.	I don't care what hospital you go to, Surgery is still a boys' club.
Bye, Turk!!!	I'm just as cool as those guys.
Anosmia? You know, I always thought it was very funny that losing your sense of smell was called "anosmia." "A-_nos_-mia", you know, like "_schnoz_mia." Don't you find that very funny?He doesn't.	The patient's complaining of anosmia.
Whoa; nobody needs to go call Dr. Cox.	I'm calling Dr. Cox.
'Course it's temporary. It could also be slightly more un-temporary.	This is only temporary, right?
Just when you think you have this place figured out, it finds a new way to get you.	You mean "permanent."
Sometimes it comes right at you.	I'm gonna go ahead and guess: Seven dollars.
Sometimes it sneaks up on you.	Nothing.
Mr. Blair, I'm really sorry this happened.	I told you I didn't want these antibiotics. Tell you what: When your first grand-kid is born, you pick him up and you smell his head, why don't you give me a call and tell me how great it is?
And sometimes, it hits you in places you didn't even know you were vulnerable.	Mr. Blair, I'm really sorry this happened.
Damn.	No more silly medical mistakes, huh? Nice going, there, Newbie.
A patient's blaming me for losing his sense of smell.	I bought some relaxation tapes.... They're working.
No, I-I just gave him I.V. Imipenem.	Oh, God, you cut off someone's nose!? Where is it? Do you have it on you? You're disgusting!
Ted, I don't I don't have the nose. Maybe you should just calm down.	Kelso's gonna blame me. Just...get rid of the nose!
My bad.	MAYBE _YOU_ SHOULD CALM DOWN!
Great. Thank you, Ted.	Imipenem...Imipenem...Imipenem...."Unlike Gentamicin and Tetracycline, Imipenem has never been associated with anosmia." My God, we're okay. We're okay.
What?	It's...my birthday.
No, _I'm_ a doctor! Look at the books, woman!	We thank you.
You were wrong and I was right.	Gosh, I'm thrilled you approve, but, for the last time: I'm up here. I'm up here. I'm up here!
Anosmia isn't a side-effect of I.V. Imipenem. Plus, Mr. Blair had multiple nasal polypectomies, and septoplasty; and his loss of smell is most likely caused by repeated manipulation of the sinuses along with concurrent infection. So, I didn't make a mistake; and you were wrong when you said, "Nice goin', Newbie."	I beg your pardon?
kinda.	Here you've put me in a tough situation: I can't honestly decide whether to say, "Duh," uh, "Doy," or a very sarcastic, "Oh, really?" My God, Fiona, I know it wasn't your fault; hell, the patient probably knows! But he seemed a little distraught, like maybe being able to blame somebody for a second or two just might make him feel a little better? And, I know, maybe it's me, but doesn't that seem like something that goes right along with wearing that fancy white coat? It...does, doesn't it.
"Woof"?	Gosh, I'm so proud of ya. Put her there.Woof.
I still don't know why I was so desperate for everyone to know it wasn't my fault.	The weird thing is, she said she'd already tried "Stink-bug."
I guess it comes down to how we want to be seen by other people.	I'm sorry.
Some people want to be seen as the rebel.Some people just want to be seen, period.Some people have limits on how far they'll go to protect their image.	I would, too!
For me, it was when I stopped worrying about how other people saw me that I finally started to look better.	Coming.
Oh, Mr. Blair, I just wanted to say again that I made a mistake, and I'm sorry.	For me, it was when I stopped worrying about how other people saw me that I finally started to look better.
Good luck.	It's all right.
Laverne! Careful.	Come on, baby. Let's see if we can find you a ride.
Well, you know, maybe tomorrow, I'll get a bad hair-cut and push around a mop all day!I know you don't have to do it, okay?Yeah.	Oh, so we're done with the coats?? All right. Well, it was a fun day, though, wasn't it? See you tomorrow.
You want to get a _clear_ shower curtain? Why don't I just nude up in the living room and you can spray me down with a hose.	How 'bout this one?
I have a chest hair.... I named him Clancy.	Dude, if you're gonna be that self-conscious, I could always doodle in chest hairs right about where you'd stand.
And then it happened....	I have a chest hair.... I named him Clancy.
We're practically kids!	Careful, honey!
Yeah! You have not lived until you've seen a drunken pig do The Robot.	Well, we used to dress up as pigs and hit every bar in town?
Big plans!	We got plans!
Oh, I may take a bath first.	Yeah, pretty much.
Give me some!	Bubbles?
It was sad, 'cause I started to think I'd never feel like a kid again.	Give me some!
What the hell are you doing here!?	Arrgghh! Hey-hey-hey, little brother! It's the head-lockin' Dan!
Dr. Cox, this is my big brother, Dan! He just showed up unexpected!	You know, it's funny, Vivian, I was just going to ask you the exact same question, seeing as how I paged you four minutes and thirty-eight seconds ago.
Dan, um...mm-mm, mm-mm.	Whoa, whoa; easy, there, chief! Why don't we have one of those nurses, there, pour you a big, tall glass of calm down juice.
Oh, Dan, no.	Aaaaactually, why don't you tell me what you keen on?
Maybe he'll let that go....	Oh. Plus, you get to hang out with Bambi!
Well, you know, it's a term of endearment that only Carla uses.	Bambi?
Why are you here?	Well, that's smart, because you do not want to get on Bambi's bad side and suffer the wrath of Bambi! Brrr!
What?	Let me do it.
I can't let you tell him!	I can totally be a doctor.
Doctor, it's an emergency, we need you right away.	That's what I'm saying. Let's keep an eye on the little Rickles children are our future!
See, why hurt me?	He mentioned the nerds.
You know, it's nice when your friends and family click. It makes you feel likeWait a second, is she still laughing?	You know I think it's sexy to dance with a woman who can lift her partner over her head.
Stop your stupid laughing! It makes you look like a whore!Jokin'! Heh.	That is
That's a little weird for me 'cause...I don't know if you'd know this or not, but...we used to be intimate.	Yeah, I remember that.So, while I'm here, we should play some frisbee golf, we should...maybe give dad a call.... Dad. Oh, we should definitely make sure I sleep with that Elliot chick.
Yeah, once...but she was wearing a swimsuit.	Int inimate? What'd you do, bathe her?
Score.	He called me son! He called me son!
Yeah, I...well, you know, I would've invited you, but I already made the reservation for two.	So, uh, you going to lunch with your brother?
Ohh, I'm not gonna mess with that hostess. You know, she uses sharp tones.	So call and change it to three.
Because I need special time with my brother! Argh!	Heh, yeah right. Now, I'll give you three seconds to give me the real reason I can't go to lunch, otherwise I'm coming.Three...two...one.
Excuse me?	Trick.
Whatever.	I just figure you gotta be wondering, "Am I gonna get a trick, or am I gonna get a treat?" You'll be getting a trick.
You just told me it was gonna be you.	It'll be fast, and you won't even know it's me.
False alarm, boys.	You'll still have your doubts.And the best part is, you're gonna be nervous all day about it, 'cause it could happen at any time!That wasn't it. Fun, though!
You do not have to answer that.	What?!
Hey!	'Kay, if he tries hard but there's room for improvement, take a sip of your drink.
All right, you know, fine. A-ask me if she could be better!What? Thirsty!	What? I was thirsty.
But not just like any bar it's like "_The_ Bar". It's like, when all the college kids come home from Thanksgiving, it's like where everybody goes. I go there when I'm home.	I tend bar.
Well, Dan, you don't _stay with her_. I mean, come on, it it it he's not like Greg Brady living in the attic with beads for a door. I mean...he totally has his own space. More like...uh, Kirk Cameron in the last season of 'Growing Pains', when he lived above the garage with Boner? Anyone? Am I the only one? Boner? ...No?	Yeah, I kinda take care of my mom's place, so she lets me stay with her.
And that's when I realized that even though I was a little jealous, that's not why I was trying to keep Elliot and Dan apart.	Well, Dan, you don't _stay with her_. I mean, come on, it it it he's not like Greg Brady living in the attic with beads for a door. I mean...he totally has his own space. More like...uh, Kirk Cameron in the last season of 'Growing Pains', when he lived above the garage with Boner? Anyone? Am I the only one? Boner? ...No?
Dan's doing great.	And that's when I realized that even though I was a little jealous, that's not why I was trying to keep Elliot and Dan apart.
...The real reason was that I was ashamed of my brother. And I think he knew it, too.	Dan's doing great.
Would you please just let it go!?	And every time you say that, an angel gets their wings.No, it's a sweet ride, but as J.D. has made so abundantly clear, I I could never afford this car.
Somehow I knew my brother would handle this the way he always did when there was a deep emotional conflict between us.	Not if I see you first.
No...why?Oh, God! Oh, please tell me that......that was the horn!	So, can you work the windows from back there?
Oh, God! It's everywhere!	There's your heated seat, my friend.
That wouldn't have been a wise choice! No, seriously, thank you, Elliot; we're fine.Damn you, you dirty ape!	You and your brother? I mean, come on, the tension on the ride back to work was palpable. I wanted to say something. I mean, I was this close to getting back in the car.
You weren't wearing a gorilla suit before?	What costume?
A gorilla....	There's someone running around in a gorilla suit? What's he look like?
Well, then, why'd you knock the folder out of my hand?!	No, it's not me.
I didn't ask you to do that!	Because you asked me to. Here you go.
Oh, good, sir.	Hey, sport, how you doin'?
Dr. Kelso, I	I don't have time to stand here and flirt, son. There have been rumblings that you let your brother play doctor the other day.
Sir, I don't follow.	Dr. Dorian, if I had one shred of evidence that incident actually took place, you would be working with my nephew Francis so fast, it'd make your head spin!
Not _inside_, no.	He cleans pools! I forgot you didn't know that! Well, anyway, I trust we will not be seeing your brother in the hospital again!
She wore a tank-top to Fred's thirteenth birthday party.... She taught us how to bob for apples, and three guys passed out.	I'll talk about boobs. Remember Fred Kiefer's mom?
Yeah! Those were awesome!	Dude, remember the cans on Pat Clark's mom?
Elliot! Come on! What does she expect us to talk about?	'Kay, you know what, forget it.
Oh, yeah....	I don't know.... Maybe the fact that you're so embarrassed by me that you make excuses to your friends about how I live my life.
She makes great eggs!	I like living with mom.
And now for the apology.	All in all, I'm pretty damn happy! I'm happy...you know?
That's a load of crap.Look, I know you, okay. I know the reason you wanted to pretend you're a doctor yesterday is 'cause you hate working in that bar and you wanted to feel like somebody for once. Come on, man, you're not you're not driving that car across the country for the three hundred dollars you're doing it 'cause you like the way you feel when you drive it. And the funny thing is, you could be that guy, but you're afraid that if if you actually have to try at something you might fail, and that's just not a chance you're willing to take.	And now for the apology.
Dan....	What can I say? It's been a real pleasure seeing you.
Right then, I knew I'd never see my brother the same way again.You can never let go of the kid inside of you.	Dan....
I'd let her to blow my house down, you know what I'm sayin'!	Dude, that girl in the wolf outfit is totally checking you out!
You see, it's the kid inside of us that keeps us all from going crazy.	...a cashew!
...Even their own home video.	So, Mike, before we get you out of here, I think it's important we go over this one more time, okay?
See, right about here is where you get hurt.Aw-ha-ha!See here, you're not hurt, and then Oh! Good God! Hurt again!Not hurt.... Hurt!Baritone.... Soprano!Married with two kids.... Dying old	...Even their own home video.
Okay; okay, Mike, that's all that matters.Victor.... Ohhhhh....Victoria!I mean, the kid thinks he's Evil Knievel	Look, I-I get it, okay.
Oh, please. I lived for danger.	Oh, gosh, Martha, I'd love to attend your safety camp this summer I would but here my parents are making me go to Maine with them. So whatta you say you make sure and take a lot of pictures, that way, when you get back, we can both sit down and put together a "Friends Forever" collage. Come on, now, the kid's sixteen years old he's a little busted up, it's not that big a deal. I mean, hell, when...when you were a kid, you must've cut your hand on your doll house?
Who's ready for some frisbee!Get my mom! Get my mom!	Oh, please. I lived for danger.
I had...four different helmets.	Who's ready for some frisbee!Get my mom! Get my mom!
I usually don't walk away from Dr. Cox, but today's the day the pharmaceutical reps show up to peddle their new drugs. And, at Sacred Heart, that means one thing: Julie's here.	Lookit, I don't have time right now to be the hundred-watt bulb for your annoying little moth, so if you could just fly away, that'd be great. Just fly awa hey....?
Damn.	I usually don't walk away from Dr. Cox, but today's the day the pharmaceutical reps show up to peddle their new drugs. And, at Sacred Heart, that means one thing: Julie's here.
No, _that's_ hot.	Damn...What? She's hot.
Yeah...you can't ever give a guy that window.	Hey, Baby!
Ohh? Were you named after a precious jewel...ie?	Hi, handsome! I'm Julie.
No.... I'd _love_ one.	You're cute! Would you like a pen?
Steady.... Easy, now.... You're almost...there!	Well, go ahead, take it.
But I	Steady.... Easy, now.... You're almost...there!
She's talking about our tushies. I say we go back, but let's walk backwards!	Well, I gotta say, I don't mind watching you two boys walk away! Oh, yeah, work it! Ow!
What? I am not gonna say a word.	Well, yes it does. But, here, that's what makes it delicious.
Except that. And...that. And now that. And that and that and that. It just keeps on going!	You just did.
That's fine.	Yeah. If that's okay?
No. N-n-no no catchies.	You know, I just wanted to, uh, sneak out for an hour, and see my kid's fourth grade play. But, you caught me!
I gotta get back to work.	No, no, no; I think you're right. From now on, before I do anything, I'll make sure to run it by you first. Permission to go see my kid's attempt to overcome his crippling shyness by appearing in his fourth grade class's production of "Town Without A Turkey"?
What just happened!?!	"Back to work..." Message received.
Well, amazing is sort of a strong word.... I just show up and let the Lord work through me.	You are amazing!
Well, I do have better bed-side manner.... I anticipate problems way ahead of time.... Oh, and my hair never gets in my face; so yes, yes I do!	You actually think you're a better doctor than me, don't you?
No I don't.	Well, I do have better bed-side manner.... I anticipate problems way ahead of time.... Oh, and my hair never gets in my face; so yes, yes I do!
Please, I never do this....	Yes you do. Every time you stare off in to space like this.......I know you're just thinking of something you're too afraid to say.
Maybe she's just upset because she knows I'm right?	Please, I never do this....
Hi, Julie!	Hi, boys!
It's Plomox.	That's a tough one.
I'm not the boss of anyone around here.	Well, you're not the boss of me!!!
Enough, already! I'm not doing this.Fine! Permission granted!	Permission to use the can, Boss.
Well.... Keep it real!	Look, dude, the only way to feel alive is to push the limits once in a while. You know?
Buy a cup!Hey. What's wrong?	Oh, God.See ya, geek!
There are a lot of things that can take you by surprise.Sometimes, it's just realizing that you're not as happy as you thought.Sometimes, it's a hot chick smacking her tushie.And sometimes, it's when you take a chance...and lose.	Mrs. Kahn died on the operating table.
This is a crucial moment. Pick your words carefully.	This just sucks.... You know?
I guess I was right after all.Stupid!	This is a crucial moment. Pick your words carefully.
Elliot! Hey! What I said earlier came out completely the wrong way; I just want you to know that I-I	I just need an opportunity to talk to her when there's no possible way that she can interrupt me.Peanut-butter cracker! Go, go, go!
She's a crafty lass.	Bite me!
Oh, God, this is painful. It's like watching a shark circle a baby harp seal.	Now, see, there I _was_ joking. Try to keep up.
He's like a royal python torturing a hopper mouse. ...Man, I love Animal Planet.	Dr. Reid faced a very difficult decision. And she chose an extremely risky course.
And here comes the crushing blow!	I believe we all have a lesson to learn from Dr. Reid's case....
Whattos to who?	...I say, kudos to Dr. Reid.
Never?	...Without surgery, her patient didn't have a popsicle's chance in hell. By making the tough choice, she at least gave Mrs. Kahn an honest shot.And now, for all of you "wait and see" doctors out there.......If you do not get to the point where you have the courage to take risks, you will _never_ be a great doctor.
What are you talking about?	No problem. Hey.... You never told me that you're part Native American.
No, no, no, no! No quitsies! Check-mate, Gin, and Yahtzee, my friend.	Then I quit.
We've started a new game now, haven't we.	You know, my son used to love to play Yahtzee with me, until you made me skip his play. Now he won't eat!
Mm. You see that nurse over there? I love her. Every night at 10:30 for the last year, I've watched her come in here and get a cup of coffee. And not once have I had the courage to even ask her her name.	I jotted a couple of things down!
The point is, Kelso's right; you know? It's not even just professionally in my personal life, I don't take any chances, either. I want to, I just...I can never seem to take that first step.	Well, if it makes you feel any better, she has a snaggletooth.
What?	Come here!
Where are we going? I don't I don't want to go anywhere. I want to spend time with Snaggletooth!	Come on!
I guess it all comes down to what we're willing to risk.For some of us, it's our feelings....	Nooo.
For others, it's our future....	No.
For me, it was taking a risk, period. Even if that meant starting with my very first step.	I know, Buppy. I know.
I don't wanna do it.	Dude, you're gonna love this!
We could die!	Come on, what's the worst that could happen?
Can't we just go back and talk to Snaggletooth?!	Okay, the second worst?
You learn to appreciate the little things like waking up in your own bed.Of course, if there's someone there with you....	Oh, thank you!
....that's just gravy.Yep, there's nothing like mornings at home!	I'll live.
Morning.	Hey, there, Sunshine!
I forgot Carla is staying with us while her building is being fumigated.	Morning.
The average resident owes over one hundred thousand dollars in med school loans, and makes about as much as a waiter. So you have to do things to make ends meet.Like, you can cover someone's shift.....Or you can steal stuff from the hospital.Or you can moonlight at an urgent care center.....Or, you can steal stuff.Or your dad can pay for everything.....Or, well...you know....	Hey, can somebody tell me why we have no milk or orange juice, but, like, forty fruit cups in here?
Why?	Hold up.
Well, what about that guy taking scrubs?	There's been several thefts around the hospital. We're doing bag checks.
Well, go ahead, narc. I'm clean.	He doesn't have a bag.
Of course, if he was checking my trunk....	Yeah? Ah-ha!
Pudding! Score!	Of course, if he was checking my trunk....
Did he just wink at me?	Well, what can I say? You did exceptional work today, Newbie, and I'm proud of you.
I'm just so happy!No, no problem, sir.	There a problem?
Because I did exceptional work today.	Why the hell is he so cheery?
Sweet! Dude, you are like the best friend ever!	And they said they'll pay you two hundred bucks cash money.
Twice this morning, and I haven't even had my coffee yet.	Well, I haven't pooed in six days.
I'm just saying, if I had to get three by lunch, I probably could.	You really pick odd things to brag about.
Obstetrics and Gynecology is a specialty that's usually dominated by women.	Hey, guys. Gyno Girls, twelve o'clock.
Being a Gyno Girl is a lot like being in a sorority.	Dr. Reid? I'm Dr. Gerson. We were just wondering if you have any thoughts about your specialty? Because we really think you're OB-GYN material.
Ah, just gimme a second, I'm figuring something out for a patient.	J.D.! I can't go with Dr. Gerson because I have to help you...right?
Dammit!	I'm glad we all finally experimented with each other...but I'll never do it again.
How about if Dr. Turk sings "Jimmy Crack Corn"?How about if Dr. Turk sings "Jimmy Crack Corn" as Neil Diamond?	Now, will a lollipop put a smile on your face?
Hit it.	Okay.
_Three_ hundred?	Dr. Dorian. We could use you again tomorrow if you'd like to make another three hundred dollars?
Luckily for Turk, revenge is a dish best served cold.... Not unlike this tapioca pudding.	_Three_ hundred?
Oh? Well, that's good.	You know, we're zeroing in on the guy that's been stealing stuff.
Really?	Yep. In fact, right now, I'm dusting for fingerprints.
I didn't mean anything by it; I...I wink at everybody.Oh, hey, Dr. Kelso!	Oh, my God, Sabrina. You had better tell me that you just had laser eye surgery and they accidentally severed the muscle that enables you to hold that lid up, because you did not just wink at me!
Oh, boy.	Save it for the bath houses, sport.
Well, maybe that's because I found out you stole a hundred dollars from me and I Marcia Brady'd your ass.	That's funny, the lady didn't call me?
You know, when Marcia was working at the ice cream shop, and then she got Jan a job, and they liked Jan better, so they fired Marcia.	What?
Then maybe it's because I told her that you smoke the ganja.	Yeah, "Marcia Gets Creamed" Season Five, Episode Three. Don't _ever_ question me on The Bunch. Besides, there's no way they liked you better than me.
Where're you going? Munchies?	What!? That that's not even true! You're a jackass!
What? No! I hate pudding, and I don't use toilet...paper.I have one of those French things that shoots water up your butt.	No. They found twenty bottles of Vicodin in his backpack. Did you steal pudding and toilet paper?
Bidet to you, sir.	"Bidet."
That is so cool! Did they let you run the siren?	Yeah, I know, but I...freakin' caught a E.M.T. shift, and I was riding around in an ambulance all night.
Oh, quit being such a baby.	I'm not talking to you. ....And, yes.
You stole my money!	"Bab " You stole my job!
Oh, yeah? Well find this!	That was a _finder's fee_!
Wouldn't that hurt?	You know, you're supposed to grab your crotch when you say that.
Come on, Turk! Turk!	Man, because of you, I gotta ride around in the ambulance all night and you know I get car-sick!
You can't just take a computer.	Hey, idiot.Heh, I said "idiot" and you looked. Hey, help me carry this computer into my van.
Stay low.	Help me, or we go check out the trunk of your car.
Carla....	Sh Marie! She's only with you for one week!
We'll talk later.	Hold on a second.Bambi, I've got ten messages from my mother. My Aunt Marie won't stop calling me _about_ my mother. I still gotta run home and put out canned food for my cat, because apparently the dry stuff doesn't cut it anymore. Plus, Turk and I can't find five minutes to spend together, because I'm working doubles and he's moonlighting non-stop so we can scrape together enough money to send my mother to a decent retirement community. So, what, Bambi? What?!
Carla said something that made me realize exactly what I had to do.	We'll talk later.
She said "we."	What the hell are you doing in here?
Carla. She said "we" "We need to scrape some money together." And it wasn't just like a "we're dating" we; it was just like a "we're gonna spend the rest of our lives together" we. I don't know, man, that that just seems big to me, you know?	What?
Can I run the siren?	Yeah, I know.
Wow.	Yeah. I think so.
Ah, forget about it. You can keep the hundred bucks.	Sorry I ripped you off.
I usually don't like thinking about the future. I mean, let's face it, you can't predict what's gonna happen.But sometimes, the thing you didn't expect is what you really wanted after all.Maybe the best thing to do is just stop trying to figure out where you're going, and just enjoy where you're at.	I was gonna, man. I was gonna.
Elliot, I'm a hundred and thirty thousand dollars in debt. You're gonna be all right.	Gu I can't afford this place!
Nada. That's fourteen times we've done it to him, and not one laugh.	Nothing?
Elliot's dad cut her off financially. Luckily, she's got friends to rally around her.	Let's get going to Elliot's.
You got any food?	Elliot's dad cut her off financially. Luckily, she's got friends to rally around her.
This pear is delicious!Need help packing?	Lately, I just feel like I'm drowning, you know?
As bad as things were going for Elliot...	This pear is delicious!Need help packing?
Oh, God, that's good.	As bad as things were going for Elliot...
...they were going pretty well for me.	Oh, God, that's good.
Uhhhh, actually, Dr. Cox, I was watching TV last night, and they had this special on flesh-eating bacteria....	I guarantee you, that's a simple case of cellulitis right there.
Yeah, I think they called it "flesh-eating bacteria" to sound more flashy — you know, hook in all the idiots.	Necrotizing fasciitis; yeeeesss?
Anyhoo, point being, uh, they said it was very easy to confuse, uh, cellulitis with chompers...."Chompers" was the — the animated flesh-eating bacteria that — that narrated the special.	Apparently it worked.
Come on, trust yourself.	Look, Britney, recently I made the potentially fatal mistake of getting back together with my ex-wife, who, angel that she is, is carrying the spawn of another man's seed. So forgive me if I sound a tad irritable when I tell you, I don't care what piece of irrelevant drivel you picked off TV while you were snuggled up in your Holly Hobbie P.J.s.
I think you're wrong.	Come on, trust yourself.
Bah, it's nothing, sir. Anyone coulda made that call.	Brilliant! Necrotizing fasciitis! That's a one in a million diagnosis, son! One in a million!
Thank you, sir.	And yet, they didn't. The student becomes the teacher, eh, Perry? Haha... warms my heart.
Holy crap, it's David Copperfield!	So, I'm guessin' this is just about the greatest moment of your life, huh, there, Newbie?
Well, definitely top two.What's that I see in your ear...? Pa-ZOW!	Holy crap, it's David Copperfield!
Do you want it?	Cool, a coin.
No, top three. Top three.	Here, you take it.Haw-haw! Magic!
...I was The Man.	Yeah!
You!	Great diagnosis!
Grr!	There's Mr. Flesh-Eating Bacteria!
Ah! Sure. "To my two biggest fans."	Doctor. Could you sign these, please?
I — I know... I'm a doctor.	Yeah. They're called breasts.
First of all, in your face, because it was Friday night; and secondly, I woulda made the catch regardless — you see, if you use your head and do some homework, medicine is just... it's basically science!	You know, Eunice, you never even woulda made that catch if you weren't such an all-purpose nerd, sitting home alone on a Saturday night, watching some medical special on TV!
You are correct, sir! Haha—	Admitting it is the first step, Perry! Am I right, Ace?
Hell, yeah.	Yeah, I'll say whatever I want.
Just like that?	You know, I called my mom today, to see if she could convince my dad to send some cash, right? She says I should try and think of this whole thing as some kind of opportunity, and then she hung up on me!
Look, Elliot, my dad's an office supplies salesman. A bad one. So things were a little different for me, growing up.	Well, I may have told her that she spends more money dying her roots than I do on groceries. Still, this whole thing is just as much her fault as it is my father's — neither one of them prepared me for this.
See, this is a bicycle bell. Now, you hold on to this, because I'm gonna give you a different part every year. Maybe after the party, we can take it out for a spin!	Look, Elliot, my dad's an office supplies salesman. A bad one. So things were a little different for me, growing up.
Great.	See, this is a bicycle bell. Now, you hold on to this, because I'm gonna give you a different part every year. Maybe after the party, we can take it out for a spin!
'Kay?	Great.
Still waiting on that kick-stand.	'Kay?
I bet that snowflake thing is bogus, too.	All right, we've got two new admissions — both male, both mid-forties, both with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
Oh, are you too busy eating sour grapes?	I say we let Super Doc here take 'em.
Well, believe what you want to believe. I'll do it again.	Look who peeked in his shorts and found a pair! What are you, feeling like you finally took on the old man in a game of one-on-one and kicked his ass? Well, here's the news-flash, there, Skeetch: It was a fluke!
Please. I know all there is to know about thrombotic... thrombo... cyto — cytop-top-top-top... toppee— toppee—	All right, fair enough, here's your chance — two identical patients. I say we divide 'em up, just like in The Parent Trap. One goes with the sexy, free-wheeling, bachelor dad — hello. The other goes with the whiny, neurotic, sexually repressed mom — oh, just you all over.Oh, and I checked tonight's TV listings — there is no special on that disease, so you're gonna want to stop at the Blockbuster.
Hmmm... the chart for Dr. Cox's TTP patient. I could look and see, but I'm not that insecure about my—	Sweetheart, you don't have to explain yourself to me. But you'd better get your story straight when you come face-to-face with Jesus.
Oops! I. Will. Get. It!Yes! He's doing the exact same thing!	Hmmm... the chart for Dr. Cox's TTP patient. I could look and see, but I'm not that insecure about my—
When you work in a hospital, and things are going well, you should enjoy it while you can.Because, around every corner, there's something waiting to take it all away.	Oops! I. Will. Get. It!Yes! He's doing the exact same thing!
Of course, every once in a while, you manage to get away scot-free.	Yeah, which one of you two's been messing with my business?
Hey, Dr. Cox! You'll be happy to know that I did everything for my patient that you did for yours.	Of course, every once in a while, you manage to get away scot-free.
He died?	Hey, Ace. Your TTP patient coded — I pronounced him.
What?	Boy, that's tough.
Oh, no.	I'd stay and talk you through this, but I gotta go check on my patient; you see, he's still alive.
See? He's pissed!	"Hey, Mark!"
For whatever reason, I was finally fed up.	That's because his name is Frank. Now, as far as your patient's concerned, well, Newbie, I'm afraid you forgot one very important thing.
You know what, I've been working my ass off here for the last year and a half, and the last thing I need is another one of your condescending, never-ending speeches where you spoon-feed me some giant lesson and call me a girl's name.	For whatever reason, I was finally fed up.
Go ahead, walk away! Because I'm not gonna obsess about this!Can you put a rush on this autopsy? I gotta figure this out.You got some crumbs in his hair.	Well, then, have it your way, there, Carol. 'Cause I'm out.Good luck, everyone.
Okay, fine, you caught me — I'm checking on my patient.	Dr. Walsh. Murder, She Wrote!
Hey, Dr. Cox. I'm sorry, I was just so frustrated before. So, now I'm here, why don't you go ahead and tell me what I forgot?	Thank you.
Sure! Hit me.	Can I? Really?
What?!	How about, "Go to hell, Shakira."
Why do you always have to be like that? You know that I try harder than anyone in this place, and you never give me any credit!	What, now that you've decided you're ready to listen, how does it work, huh? You gonna pull a string on my back? Well, step right up and give it a tug. But, I'm warning you, I bet it keeps coming up "Go to hell, Shakira."
Thanks for your help.	Now, you listen to me, Newbie. I'm not doing this because I get my jollies off of being your mentor, and I'm damn sure not doing it so that years from now I can say, "Boy, I knew him when." I'm doing it because if I don't, people would die.
As I sat there, still searching for answers about my patient, I realized that I still needed Dr. Cox. It's hard to face a harsh truth about yourself.I guess the only thing you can do is try to take positive steps.Unfortunately, it's hard to take positive steps when you've burned the bridge you need to walk across.	Yeah, you will. But with me, it's okay, because I love you.Besides, I barely listen, anyway.Come on, Rowdy! Let's go, boy! Let's hit up the fourth floor.Whoa, whoa, boy! Whoa! Slow down!
What?	It was luck.
Thanks.	The thing that you forgot? Turns out, whatever you know about medicine, ultimately, luck or fate or God or... who knows what is always gonna end up playing a much bigger role in the whole thing than you and I ever will. Hell, it was lucky you were watching that show the other night. And it was unlucky that your patient went the other way, even though you did absolutely everything right; and, for the record, you did. I was looking over your shoulder every step of the way.
Let's not make a big deal out of this.	I know we put on a hell of a show, but, dude, put some shades on or something!
Okay, just subtly take the spotlight off yourself.	J.D., when was the last time you got laid?
Once, on a red-eye flight, Turk groped a trans-sexual.	Okay, just subtly take the spotlight off yourself.
Mission accomplished.	Baby, it was dark, and he/she had a body that was rockin'!
Okay! So I'm in a bit of a dry spell.... I have no idea what to do with myself.	We're talking about you right now, studly.
Please! I'm a young, single player with a heart of gold. I should be able to stir something up.How _do_ you get so dirty?...Rowdy!	Why don't you give Rowdy a bath he smells a little ripe.
I'm not the only one in a rut.	Please! I'm a young, single player with a heart of gold. I should be able to stir something up.How _do_ you get so dirty?...Rowdy!
At least you're pretty.	My life is a mess!
Sometimes the hospital seems like a big, hungry monster that feeds on our personal lives.It affects all of us.	Yeah, I know, I was just frazzled. I stopped taking my dad's money, so I can't pay the bills; I'm getting kicked out of my apartment; and thank-you to this stupid hospital, I haven't even had time to look for a new place!
Morning, Dr. Cox!	Sometimes the hospital seems like a big, hungry monster that feeds on our personal lives.It affects all of us.
Ha! Well.... Put it in your pocket and save it for later!	You know, you're about one of the cutest doctors I've ever met! Give me a kiss!
The monster kills everything that's beautiful. Everything! ....Except Lisa, the Gift Shop girl!	Ha! Well.... Put it in your pocket and save it for later!
Whatever. Dry spell, prepare to be moistened!	Okay, boys, remember, now: When we get upstairs, it's the trauma ward, not the "drama ward," so smiles, everyone. Smiles.
Hey, Lisa! How you doin'?	Whatever. Dry spell, prepare to be moistened!
Free gum No! You know, I was just thinking, you're probably one of those girls that's so pretty that no one ever has the courage to ask you out.	J.D., I can't give you free gum.
Okay, momentary set-back. Regroup. Regroup!	No, I get asked out all the time.
Hey, go out with me.It's the right thing to do.	Okay, momentary set-back. Regroup. Regroup!
Very funny, you dumb choir punks! Santa's a drunk! Where were we?	Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Ohh, I could think of a couple things....	So...what did you have in mind?
Who the hell cares.	How _does_ he get so dirty?
Hold me down! Know what I'm sayin'?	Hey, it was a pleasure meeting you, Lisa.YO!Yeah! Gift Shop Girl! Player!
I swear on all the gifts in her shop, I will make you proud.	Hey, look at me. I want you to turn Gift Shop Girl into Gift Shop Woman.
Look, you can either be a jerk as usual or you can accept this gracious offer and get some caramel draped in nougat. Your choice, Jumpsuit.	A buck! What a kind offer from the charitable Dr. Moneybags!
I've seen bigger.No, not you. Although, kudos!	Yes. Relax.
So, it appears Mrs. Watson has developed a post-op infection at her thyroidectomy site.	Well, great. See you tonight.
Mmm-hmm.What? You don't own that!	Newbie, when a patient has an infection, I make it a general policy not to actually push on it. Just start Ancef 1 gram Q 8 hours, and oh, my God, did I just ask my ex-wife to move in with me?
You know, you should move in with my friend: Anal McLooney.	Oh, well, if you don't, it gets mildewy.
Why don't you just crash with me and Turk till you find a place?	I am so screwed! I had to move out of my apartment this morning all of my stuff is outside in a truck.
Fine.	I am so tired of everyone always thinking that I need to be rescued! Okay, J.D.?
Lucky girl.	Someone's getting a late-night drunk call from The Todd.
I can't stop obsessing about this date I have tonight. What do you think I should do?	Sure, Jordan...I guess you could take over the master bathroom. But, would you do me a favor and leave my sleeping pills out in case, when I get home, I want to take 300 of them? Okay, bye.
You know, Perry	Well, for starters, you should probably go ahead and thank your lucky stars that you finally found a gal who's into same-sex relationships.
Yeah, I'm trying it out. I find, with the ladies, if you're clear with your intentions right off the bat, they just fall in to place. A.Q.?	"Perry"?
"A.Q." is sort of a new, hip expression means "Any questions?"	What!?
Oh, yeah, the word you're looking for is "Wow." And the words I'm looking for are "In your face." Yeah! I'm ready, let's get going.P.O. peace out.	J.D.! You ready to go?
Oh, that wasn't me that was Nappy, The Ice-Breaking Puppet.	I gotta tell you, I was a little nervous when you spent the first five minutes talking through a napkin.
That little guy earned his money tonight.	Oh!
Oh, come on, I am so in.	So you think you're in, huh?
No, I feel pretty good about it. You want me.	Come on, you can't be sure.
Uh, yeah, I'm a doctor; all the symptoms are there you do.	I don't!
Whoa. Heh. Uh.... You know, I thought I had to sneeze, but it was a false alarm. Let's do this.	Just kiss me.
You know what it is? It's like a tickling. I got this, like this, like weird, like...it's a flutter. Erp!	Okay.
Yeah?	Nappy?
I guess you never know how the monster's gonna attack.	I want you to stop fooling around, and Give me a kiss.
Sometimes it pulls you away at the absolute worst time.	All right, we need to talk about this.
Sometimes it even takes the roof over your head.And sometimes, the monster takes something you never thought you could lose.......Like your mojo.	Babe, I'm sorry.
Actually, it's a roll of quarters. It's uh...laundry day! Heh.	Is that a roll of quarters in your pocket or are you just having a really good time?
See ya.	Oh.
Everything! Everything's up!	Hey, Newbie, what's up?
What, did someone send out a flier?!	Rise and shine, sport!
All right, calm down, he says that to everyone.	Hey, J.D.! How's your penis?
Okay, you're freaking out! Just keep your head down, and move.	Hey, Goldman! How's your penis?
No.	Hm? Oh, I get it! I haven't paid you back, so you won't even look at me?
See what you did!	It's been one day, you greedy little bastard!
Luckily for me, I had a friend I could talk to about anything.	Dr. Reid, your truck is double-parked.
Hey, Turk. Do you ever have any trouble getting your manhood going?	Luckily for me, I had a friend I could talk to about anything.
Heh, heh. Me neither, dawg!	Hell, no!
Apparently I'm the only one here with women problems.	Heh, heh. Me neither, dawg!
I know we seem insensitive, but in a crunch-time, most guys are smart enough to say the right thing.	Because it doesn't to me. One minute, we're clicking; and the next, you're running for your life. What's going on?
But sometimes the worst thing a guy can say is nothing at all.	Thatta girl.
You never expect a cliché to be an actual conversation starter.	Nah, it's just Todd. He's already called, like, four times to ask if I want to move into his pants.
It's like they're from another planet!	Tell me about it.
Okay...?	Okay. I'm going to engage you two in a conversation. And you speak of it to no one, agreed?
Nine.	Twelve.
My peep's on the fritz.	I just wonder if I'll ever be able to make it work out with anyone.
No, no! No, no, no, no! No, I'm talking about you guys! 'Cause y-y-y-you guys are like you guys are like my peeps, you're my dawgs, and you on the fritz. So, there that's where I get "peeps"/"fritz" came from.	Oh, poor Newbie.
Elliot! Come on! This is crazy you're living out of a van like a hobo...or...Jewel.	Yeah, so? It's, uh, it's cozy.... Hospital-adjacent.
Look, I know you want to show everyone you can stand on your own two feet, but you don't have to prove anything to me. Come on, come stay with me and Turk.	Her poetry changed my life.
I guess, in the end, the monster's always gonna be there.	I LOVE THIS WOMAN!
And sometimes that means letting a friend help you out.	Aww!
Don't sweat it. Well, have a good night.	Um...thanks again, J.D.
As for me, I just have to hope that my problem will eventually work itself out.	You too.
It was exactly what I wanted.	Merry Christmas.
My peep was on the fritz. Much better now, thank you for asking.	J.D., I'm homeless; I have no money, and everything I own is outside in a truck my life's a mess. Plus, you were...going through...a lot, too....
Four times.... And a half, if you count that last thing.	The point is, we were stressed out and vulnerable, and we made a mistake.
Animal Planet.	What'cha watching, buddy?
I don't know...but she seems to _love_ it!The Congo. But look, Elliot, I think I think you're right last night was great, but w-we can't keep doing this.Dr. Reid.	Why does that one monkey keep biting the other one on the ass?
Mistake or not, one cool thing about sex is, it always seems to put you in a good mood.Hell, I think it even cheers up the people around you.	Dr. Dorian.
Well, you're a little old...umm.... But, I I do have a room-mate who's a surgeon he owes me a favor, I could	I was wondering about circumcision.
Ohhh! Well, now...see, that we're set up for.	Talking about their _son_, Bambi.
Don't get me wrong, Carla loves her patients but she also loves how much they love her.	Me?
That's just great.	And you wanted to slice into his manhood to pluck his fruit.
Ugh! What a day! Whoo-ee! I am as stressed out and vulnerable as I was last night.	That's just great.
What to do? What to do...what to do, what to do, what to do?	Me too.
Oh, come on, we could we could rent a movie...got a fresh pack of Uno cards....You know what we could do? We could have sex again I'm throwing it out there.	I don't feel like doing anything.
Oh, come on! I'm sorry, I was kidding! I'm just it's just a joke!	Bite me.
Stay calm.	No, I mean it like you did last night.... Come bite me.
Oh, we're a train wreck.	Problem is that we already know that we don't work as a couple.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hello, and whoa!	So we can't keep doing this.
Look, Elliot, we're adults. I don't think we have to apologize for enjoying what we're doing.	J.D., it's just sex.
And that's when she said the words every man is dying to hear.	Look, Elliot, we're adults. I don't think we have to apologize for enjoying what we're doing.
If you want....	I guess we could just be sex buddies.
Oh, I...can't tell you, it's, you know, doctor-patient confidentiality.	What's all that about?
No, no, I'm I'm not kidding. I...can't.	Oh, right. Tell me.
Can't!	Can't...or won't?
Nah. Kelso calmed 'em down. I think we're okay.	Are they still going at it?
What are you talking about?	We're not okay.
Ohhhh.	What are you talking about?
Uh, yes, sir.	Does this name tag say "Chief of Medicine"?
Couldn't think of a third one, sir?	Look: Stay away from definite answers. Leave yourself some wiggle room. Say things like, We'll do what we can, or We'll get back to you on that, or...Hell, I don't know.
It sucks being yelled at. Especially when it's someone else's fault.	Dammit! When I tell you to do something, you sure as hell better get it done!
Later, dude.	Woo! I feel _so_ much better! See ya, bud!
He's had a nasty case of pneumonia. Let's see. Well, his leukocytosis is resolved, and his blood cultures are negative.... Tell him we'll do the best we can.	You know, Mr. Woodbury's son is getting married this weekend; he keeps asking me if he's gonna be able to go.
Where's the wiggle room in that? There's no wiggle!Fine. Let me just tell him with you so I can enjoy it, too.	Oh, come on! Can't we just tell him that he can go?
How do you do that?	Dude, you're totally hitting that.
Oh, relax, man. We're just having fun.	It's a gift. Now, you remember what happened the last time you two got together, right?
Fo' shizzle.	What are you guys, just sex buddies or something?
Look, if it ever got that emotional, I'd break it off.	Okay.I don't wanna get all Dr. Phil on you, but the last time I checked, women have a hard time separating sex from emotions. So, you may think you're just tappin' that right now, but pretty soon she's gonna be like, "J.D., I need you."
You are good!	Okay. Oh, by the way, dude right there is totally hitting that dude! He's totally hitting him!
I'm so glad Esteban found someone!	I know.
Around here, things can turn bad in a heartbeat.	Uh, no you don't. She switched off, too.
I guess when you work in a world of uncertainty, it's great to have something at home you can count on.	Sweetheart, Mr. Woodbury is still requiring a lot of O2, I'm afraid we're gonna have to keep him here over the weekend. Do me a favor: Give him the skinny, will you.
Elliot? What are you doing?	I guess when you work in a world of uncertainty, it's great to have something at home you can count on.
Oh. Okay.	Sitting in the dark...crying. So, you know, the usual.
She needs you? Oh, my God, Turk was right. You have to stop kissing her, and put an end to this before she gets hurt!	J.D., I had such a crappy day. I really need you right now. Come here.
Eh, she's a tough kid you can tell her later.	Is there something wrong?
Nope!	Eh, she's a tough kid you can tell her later.
Ohhh.	I just don't get it. I mean, why are so many of my patients switching off on me? Are my hands _that_ cold?
No!	You didn't tell anyone that I'm Republican, did you?
Mmmmm.	God, this can't be happening! I'm a doctor! What the hell use is being a doctor if nobody lets you treat them? What is going on with my life?
This is not the time to talk it out. So you just need to get out of the situation without making her suspicious.	Mmmmm.
Hello? ... Oh, hi, Mom! ... Yeah! I miss you, too! I haven't spoken to you in so long.Hi, Mr. Turk. ... No, Chris isn't here. ... No! No, sir, I didn't say "Mom," I said..."mon," like, "Hey, mon, we be jammin'!" ... N-no, sir, I don't think all black people are Jamaican.I I love you too, Mommy!Sir, could you call back later? Chris will be home.	This is not the time to talk it out. So you just need to get out of the situation without making her suspicious.
But you're not gonna tell me, are you.	Yeah.
He made that up.	Can't. Janitor-locker confidentiality.
Carla has to give Mr. Woodbury the bad news.	Well, of course, that could be because he's shaving his dome so much lately that the hair is actually starting to grow inward it's an affliction commonly known as the "infro." But, if I were to guess just exactly why he's been acting weird lately, I would say it's because...he's the one who's been steering your patients away from you.Discuss.
I wonder how he'll take it?	Oh, look, here she is! Come on in! I want you to meet my family!
Wait, wait, you know what? Come on...Mr. Woodbury's doing well enough to be discharged. I don't mind standing up to Kelso on this one. Time to take the "G-R" off my gratitude and give that old bastard some attitude, J.D. style!	Here goes.
I know, I have to go throw up first.	His office is that way.
Elliot, we should talk.	He's in a coma.
What?	I found out that Turk was telling my patients to switch off of my service.
I'll go talk to him.That I.V. looks like it's infiltrating. Nurse must've screwed up.	Yeah, he said he was trying to protect me.
Hello, Richard. I'll tell you what: Tomorrow, at lunch, I'll I'll I'll bring you a new basketball.... And a hoagie.	No. To Richard that was his basketball.
No.	What's up? This is about Elliot? Don't you want to hear my side of the story with your little sex buddy?
Some realizations stop you in your tracks. Others can lead you in new directions.	Come on, man, where's the love? Where's the where's the loyalty? Where's the automatically siding with the person you care about the most?Oh, my God, that's what you're doing, isn't it. Isn't it?
It's a funny thing when we're forced to see ourselves in a new light.	You get your damn life in order.Oh, and, Barbie? Let's say word were to get out that Uncle Cox was doling out the feel goods? I'll make ya pay ya have no idea. Huge!
Hopefully, you see yourself in time to make a change.	Mr. Woodbury! Hold on a sec!
And hopefully you'll be respected for it.	Unfortunately, we're not comfortable discharging you just yet. I'm really, really sorry.
Of course, sometimes, the new light opens your eyes to something you've known in your heart all along.	Glad I could help.
It's nice because it's the beginning of something.	That is so nice!
Okay, less tongue, less tongue.	I.... I can't do this.
Me neither.	No, this. You know sex buddies.J.D., Dr. Cox and I were talking, and my life is just so scattered right now. And I just...I just can't seem to grab a toe-hold, you know? And...I know myself, and if we keep doing this, I'm not gonna be able to separate the sex from my feelings. And we'll just end up being a couple again. And...neither one of us wants that, right?I mean, I know I don't.
Uh.... It's it's no big deal. You you get your stuff out of my room, and you crash on the couch.	So, what do we do?
I hate that stereotype that all black people yell at movie screens. You know? Like, you go see some horror flick, and you be yelling, like, "Don't go in there, girl, he behind the doh'!" You know? It's like...it's offensive.	Here we go.
Why does she go in there!? I mean, he's behind the doh'!	You wish you were allowed to yell at the screen, don't you!
It's weird to run into someone from the hospital out in the real world.	Why does she go in there!? I mean, he's behind the doh'!
Oh, hey, Dr. Kelso.	It's weird to run into someone from the hospital out in the real world.
Oh, I'm sorr You named your car, huh?	I'm just Jim Dandy. Now, unless your pants are made out of Turtle Wax, I suggest you boys get your asses off of Bessy.
Ultimately, life is a lot simpler at home.Unless you live with a co-worker you're crazy about, and she recently decided she can't handle sleeping with you, and she just wants to be friends.	Oh, I'm sorr You named your car, huh?
Morning, pal.	Oh...right. Morning, buddy!
All right, just relax. You can totally handle this.	I'll just go get dressed...and then, uh, we can go to work.
Chop Chop-chop, buddy!	All right, just relax. You can totally handle this.
You were right. I'll just...put this guy's side-view mirror on his roof.Argh.	Told you I could fit in this spot!
Ooh!Yes?	Hey, J.D.
G'head.	I wanted to say something, you know, before we go back in there.
Why?	That I understand that it's gonna be a little bit harder for you to transition into being just friends again.
What does that have to do with anything?	Because...you're a guy?
I know.Oh, yeah...this is how you like it.	You're right. You know what we should do? Everything I own is in the back of this truck including my bed. We should just get in there, get naked, and have sex one last time just get it out of our system.J.D., I was kidding to prove a point.
I don't feel weird.	See? This is good. I don't feel weird.
Okay, just tell her the truth you're crazy about her.	_I_ feel weird.
Look, Elliot	Okay, just tell her the truth you're crazy about her.
Why don't you just get someone else from Surgery to do it?	You guys, I can't take this sweet old lady's driver's license from her she reminds me of my Gram-Gram.
Nevermind.	Gimme it!You want this? You want this?Psych!
Oh, hey, Lisa.	Hey, J.D.
You guys, this conversation is starting to make me feel a little uncomfortable, okay? And I'm sure "Dr. Reid" feels the same way.	"Ohh! Dr. Reid!" Sweet!
So, she wants to play Chicken, huh? Well, buckle up, missy!	No I don't. You can "ehn-ehn" with anyone that you want.
Well, maybe I'll just ask Lisa out again.	So, she wants to play Chicken, huh? Well, buckle up, missy!
Maybe I will!	You should.
Good.	Cool.
That's what I'll do.	Take it home.
It's a date!	Fine. But I am taking my own car so I can escape in case you turn into a freak again.
Okay, you're smarter than him. Think of something clever to get him out of here.	What's up, Medical Dogs!
Hey, Todd.	Okay, you're smarter than him. Think of something clever to get him out of here.
So, anyway, Elliot....	What the hell? Did you just throw something out into the hall?
Great! ...You know, but there's no rush for you to move out.	Hey, I found an apartment!
That would be stupid.	Well, what are we gonna do, just live with each other forever, and anytime we feel, like, lonely or vulnerable, we just hop into bed and have hot sex?
I know.	We're both human, so, staying in that situation would be a big mistake.
I thought so.	I get it 'cause I'm a janitor, so, when I pack for a vacation, I just pack cleaning supplies. That's funny!
About...being a janitor?	Actually, I'm going to speak at my son's career day.
I I didn't mean it that way, I just....	What do you think, there aren't kids out there that want to grow up to make the world sparkle?
Look!	How did you mean it?
Where is it now?	My truck was right there.
Wow.Gotta go. Good luck.Tally-ho!	You have to ask the guy who stole it. Everything I own was in that truck.J.D., I don't know what I'm gonna do!
Yeah, well, I've had Malik since I was seventeen; that's totally different. Don't worry about Kelso, his wife can drive him.	You do.
Then what's with the look?	Nothing!
Fantastic!	Mmm.
You're the one that drew all these lines up, said that we're not in a relationship right now.	Look, I really just needed your help last night, and you completely bailed on me.
Ow.	Guess she told him.Gotta go.
I never said that.	I was just thinkin' about what you said, and, uh, you're right buncha kids don't want to hear about being a janitor.
And I'm sorry you lost all your things, that totally sucks. How're you holding up?	Thanks.
Throw her down on that gurney and mount her like a lion.	You know what? It was just stuff. I'm fine.This is good! It feels like we've really turned a corner, you know?
I know!	Throw her down on that gurney and mount her like a lion.
Yeah.... Hey, is my breath okay? Because I think Lisa and I actually might try talking tonight.	I just don't feel like going back to that hospital, you know?
It is not.	Dude, that whole damn building is packed with liars!
Okay, maybe you're right. But, we're doctors, man. I mean, that comes with the territory; some patients just don't like telling the whole truth.	Well, if the cut was that deep, I'd probably just, uh, pull your arm off.Once again: _Doctor_..._Jan_ _Itor_. Dr. Jan Itor.
I don't know.... Maybe it's 'cause they're proud...maybe it's 'cause they're scared....	Well, I don't get why people have to do that.
Maybe it's because telling the truth would make them feel too vulnerable.	You know what, it was just stuff! I'm fine.
Oh, my God!	I guess. Dude, you're gonna be late for Gift Shop Girl.
There are a few things I've always believed in....Flowers are good for any occasion.And nothing is more important than making time for an old friend.Especially if the old girl's seen better days.'Cause even if it breaks your heart to be 'just friends', if you really care about someone, you'll take the hit.	Oh, my God!
Ohh! It's beautiful! But my parents'll kill me if I marry a black guy.So, you're gonna ask Carla?	Well...?
Okay, ready?You sure?	I'm doin' it.
Congratulations! So, when are you gonna ask her?	Positive.
You might as well put it in her cham-lame glass.	Tonight I'm gonna make her a nice dinner, then I'm gonna put the ring in her champagne glass.
Okay, first you gotta get, like, fifty candles, right?	Okay, Mr. Know-It-All, what would you do?
You spread 'em all over the room with some rose petals....	Mm-hmm?
Like a meadow in springtime.	That's right, because the roses are beautiful, and they make the room smell amazing.
Yeah, bitches and hos.C'mon, hurry up.	Nothing, guy talk!
It's tough to be a woman in a co-ed locker room.	Oh yeah? If I'm "gay," how come I work out so much?
Dance! They want you to dance!	It's tough to be a woman in a co-ed locker room.
Hey, Laverne, can I borrow a nickel so I can get a soda?	Thanks, mama.
Elaine's been on top of the heart transplant list so long, she's in and out of this hospital almost as much as I am.	Sorry, this window's closed! By the way, Elaine's back.
Hey, homeslice, we talked about this you don't get into bed until I come here so I can see your bootay.	Elaine's been on top of the heart transplant list so long, she's in and out of this hospital almost as much as I am.
You are naughty!	If I finally get a damn heart, I'll let you eat ice cream off it!
I honestly believe, in hospitals...there's like this...balance. You know? It's like, when one person dies, another person gets a chance to live. I like to call it The Circle of Life.	Ugh. You know, it always feels so weird to be sitting around hoping someone's family pulls them off life support.
I like that baby lion cub. What's his name...?	Oh, my God! You must stop watching 'The Lion king'!
Trick question! You like it, too!	..."Simba"...?
I'd say she's pregnant.	Oh, you girls! Excuse me, Elaine, I actually need his opinion on something.
It's kinda flattering that you'd choose me.	Just a terrific catch, there, Newbie. Listen to her heart, will ya? I heard mitral stenosis and I need an extra set of ears, let's go.
See? We don't always have to be like, "Bluh-bluh-bluh-bluh." We could be like, "Hey! How ya doin'! I'm good, thanks!" This can work, you know? We can can be there for each other.	Thanks.
No. You keep it.	It's just a pen, Scooter, not a kidney.Thanks.
Me too. I'm a worrier.	Relax, Steve. He's a worrier.
Nah, I just, I think the Larkins compliment each other they're a good team. Kinda remind me of us.	Oh, shut the hell up, would you please? At least she's ballsy, unlike that husband who's the overly thoughtful, sensitive type that drive me crazy.What?
Sometimes it's hard to find the right words.	What the hell is going on?
Sometimes, words come easy.	Sir, I'm so happy for you I could crap.
Sometimes, the words don't come out at all.	I loved it, but, why spend all this money on this fancy dinner?
But, ultimately, you have to grit your teeth and just say it.	No reason.
You see, as a doctor, you get used to the whole balance in the hospital thing. You know, when one person lives, another dies, and how it always seems to even out...	We don't deliver this baby, your wife could die.
...but it never seems fair when it happens in the same family.	We're gonna do our best.
Oh, come on, death isn't that bad. Especially if you're dying from laughter you're on 'Candid Camera'!	Sometimes, as a doctor, I wish my life was more like my favorite TV show.
We got ya! A camera there, there, and there!	Where are the cameras?!
Have you seen Mr. Larkin?	Baby, don't go.
Oh, no.	Thanks for the pen.
Well, you know that I would never mean for that to happen. You know that, right?	Yeah.That's my favorite t-shirt.And this...my favorite skin!
Okay, this is a little cozy for me.	Yeah! I know that.
Trust me, I wouldn't want to have to make this decision.	I don't think you people are getting how difficult this is.
You know, you and I are a lot alike. We may seem like the kind of guy you can just, you know, throw in a head-lock and draw a mustache on...but, in crunch time, we always come through.It's time. Come on.	I wish I could ask my wife. She'd be better at handling this than me.
Death is always hanging around this hospital.	Nice job, Newbie. That's a real nice job. What we gotta do now is cross our fingers.
Ultimately, it all boils down to what your attitude is about it.	Morning.
What do you think death is like?	I got an idea: Why don't we switch to a cheerier subject!
I think it's like a game of dodge-ball.There's a lot of chaos and screaming, and...you know...eventually you get your glasses snapped in half by the big kid who already has underarm hair. But then you wake up in the hot nurse's office, and when she leans in to put that bandage on your nose, you get a sense that something could actually happen if you just took a chance and buried your face in her knockers.	I really hope it's like a big Broadway musical. Everyone's all dressed up and singing to the rafters, and you go out with a real flourish.
It's what I do.	It's fun to annoy him!
What's going on?	I guess sometimes my whole theory about life and death balancing each other out in the hospital doesn't hold true. I guess sometimes you get lucky.
....Yeah.	She's gone. You gonna be okay?
He needs you. Stay positive.	She said she needed to think about it, then she hopped on a plane to Chicago for five days.
Woo-hooooo! She's thinkin', she's thinkin', and we should go out drinkin'! chicka uh-huh chicka-chicka.... Wanna get a beer?	He needs you. Stay positive.
All right, man. I understand.Still nothing?!	I'm not leaving this spot until she calls.
Good sign? Dude, I am so sure Carla's gonna say yes, if she doesn't I'll power-walk naked through these halls singing "Me and Bobby McGee"!	We just keep missing each other. I'm not sweating it.She asked me to pick her up from the airport! That's a good sign, right!
Why would I take offense to that?	Ahhh, Janis Joplin! My God, she was an uggo! No offense, sport uh, don't think I have anything against ugly people.
Dr. Townshend is like the Anti-Kelso.	No reason. Anyway, I see you're on the nephrology service for Dr. Townshend this month!
The nurses love him...	Hey, Doc!
The attendings love him....	Betty! That color is great on you!
Everyone loves him.	You tell me, hot-shot!
Everyone.	"Baby, my heart's on fire...on fire...."
And the weirdest thing of all is that he and Dr. Kelso are best friends.	Thank you. For being you.
The only place this guy's running to is to a bakery! Who's got me up high?	You're a pistol!
Ahhh. Dammit.	Uh, mistake you made there, J.D.: You didn't pat his belly it soothes him.
Thanks, Todd. Here's that fifty bucks I promised you.	Not yet.
Todd, get dressed.	Keep it, man. That was for me!
How?	My man, I know that wasn't you.
Oh, it changed since you saw it it got a haircut.	I'm not really proud of this, but I can pick your puff-'n'-stuff out of a line-up.
Turk's brother is staying with us for the weekend.	Yeah.
It'll be fun.	Little brother!
Hey, Kev'!	It'll be fun.
Oh, that depends.... What's a "happie-hap"?	Hey, Alfalfa! What's the happie-haps?
That was good, Kevin! We should we should make him, like, make dinner for us tonight. He could be our own personal slave!	Yeah.
Oh, no, I don I don't mean like _that_ kind of slave.	Our own personal _what_, now?
That that wouldn't be fun....	Well, how 'bout this: How 'bout he be the house slave, and I be the field slave. That sound like fun to you?
Sometimes Elliot just can't help herself.	Whatever you say, Mr. Yesterday I Had Chest-hair, Today I Suddenly Don't.
You know, sir, Dr. Townshend, here, was telling me you have some great old stories about the hospital. I...I'd love to hear one sometime.	Oh!
I know.	He tells that one a lot.
Please!	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm gonna rush the biggest decision of my life so I can hear you say, "When I first met Chris Turk, I knew this was a guy I could party with forever! Yeah!"
She's psychic!	Please!
What Carla didn't know was that Turk was using his brother as a selling point. Because no one said "family" more than Kevin Turk.	I just wanna have a nice lunch with my boyfriend and his brother, okay?
Oh, no.	Over.
Oh, my God! Do something to change the subject! Anything!	Get the hell out of there?
Everybody! Soda chugging contest!	Oh, my God! Do something to change the subject! Anything!
'Scuse me.	Mmph.
I moved your ladder.	What the hell just happened?
I don't know, either!	I don't know...why you keep doing these things to me!
I was having a great time working with Townsie.	No.
A _cut down_? No one does those anymore.	Now, Mr. Singer, here, needs a swan. So, why don't you go ahead and do an IJ cut down?
Uh, sir, shouldn't I just do a modified Seldinger? I mean, it's so much safer.	A _cut down_? No one does those anymore.
But, sir, I don't	Nah, come on, let's do "old school."
So often in a hospital, you feel like you're alone on an island. Whether it's because you just can't bring yourself to make a really important decision...	Grab a scalpel; I'll get the kit.Somebody?
Or because you're waiting for an answer...	Carla looking at her ring.
Or simply because you know a secret you wish you didn't.	Turk lost in thought.
For me, I was stuck on that island because somebody else put me there.	Elliot nervously passing a hopeful Cox.
Oh, no.	Okay, come on now, just cut through.... Good. Now, open up the vein.... But be careful not to nick the carotid artery.Oh, boy.
All right, this sucks. But, as bad as I feel, I'm sure Dr. Townshend feels even worse for making me do the procedure.	Okay, thanks.
He hides it well.	Don't worry about it I'll take the blame, okay?
Thank you...for that.	I'm not asking.All right, guys, this is the kid I was telling you about we're gonna look out for.This is Brent from Parking. He's gonna set you up with a sweet spot right at the main entrance so you'll never be late again. This is Crazy-Eyes Margot, from Housekeeping. She's gonna make sure that you got freshly-pressed scrubs in your locker every morning. 'Course, this is Troy, you know him from the cafeteria line. He's gonna stop spitting in your food.
Still...something was bothering me.	Troy! No more warnings.Whoa! Bring the hands in.Bless us, O Lord, in these thy gifts which we are about to receive from thy bounty. Through Christ our Lord, Amen. Look out for each and every one of us, including our new member. Also...help Margot to find her way home tonight.
Excuse me, sir, do you have a second?	Once a month, until she's dead!
Dr. Kelso, I was the one who nicked the artery on Mr. Singer.	Sport, what did I tell you about my open-door policy? I don't have one.
All right, first of all, at the very least I'm interesting looking; all right? And secondly, I...feel I made that mistake because Dr. Townshend forced me to perform a procedure that is unsafe and...outdated.	You need to shape up, son. Lord knows you're never gonna get by on your looks.
Sorry, Townsie.	All right, first of all, at the very least I'm interesting looking; all right? And secondly, I...feel I made that mistake because Dr. Townshend forced me to perform a procedure that is unsafe and...outdated.
I'm sorry, sir.	Do me a favor, will ya, son? Grab that for me?Thanks!
Goodnight, sir.	Sport, if you're still standing there when I turn around, I'm gonna have them erase your name, too.
It's not always easy to do the right thing.	Goodnight, sir.
Like putting someone else's feelings first for a change.Even if it goes against what you really want.	This is to my brother, y'all! My brother!
Of course, there's always ramifications....	I'm out.
My car....	Of course, there's always ramifications....
You think it's my fault he got fired, don't you.	Yeeeeeeee-ha!
No reason.	Why would you say that?
Even if you do the right thing, there's no guarantee it'll turn out the right way.	I may have to get rid of the guy.
Because, even something as harmless as twenty or thirty drinks with your brother can end up biting you on the ass.	Oh, oh. She, uh, she's not with him. And she ain't with me. She's, uh, she’s with Rowdy not like not like that.
Oops. Wrong person.	Ooh! Ow! Oh, oh, okay.
A card musta got stuck. Gotta go!	What happened?
Yoooooooo! Check out these fries! That girl is so in to me.	Thank you, Jenny.
Why, because you're black?	Please, she's totally crushing on the brother.
Thank you, Jenny. Hey, wait, Jenny. Uh, what flavor do you usually go for: Do you like chocolate or _vanilla_?	Oh. Here's a towel.And here are your shakes.
Mmm?	I'm a vanilla girl.
"She got Jungle Fever! She got Jungle Fever!"	Go ahead and say it.
Woo-hoo!	Hit it!
Honk for love! Honk for love!	Come on, citizens! Let me hear ya! Honk in the name of love!
Morning, Dr. Cox!	Finish the sentence in the next two seconds or start running.Oh, dear God, you're actually frozen with fear. All right, don't worry about a thing, I'm going to talk you through this. I want you to relax, take a big breath, and now... get out of here!! You go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go!
You know, you already used Betsy, like, six months ago.	Betsy, good morning. Let's make with the chop-chop.
You should just do it.	Uh.
Well, it'd only take fifteen minutes of your life, and it wouldn't hurt to be in good with him for once.	Really?
Yeah. Feel free to return the favor.	You're giving me advice?
What's that supposed to mean?	Fair enough. Try this on for size: No matter where you go in life, always keep an eye out for Johnny, the tackling Alzheimer's patient.
How's it going?	Buh-duh-na-duhhh...ooh!...ba-duh-duh-duhhh....da-bow!Had to be done, Bob. Continue, handsome.
I got nothing.	I just got my vertebrae fused.
I'm pressing the button.... It's not working.	Hey! Hold that elevator!
Carol, I cannot thank you enough. Mmm...is that Ben-Gay?	So what?
Better than a 'mecretary.' Or a 'manicurist.' No, that works.	I'm dating a _murse_.
I'll bring the Fluffer Nutters!	Giant "Who cares?"So, I'll see you fellas tonight, what, around 7:30? Don't be late, or you won't get a seat!
Ohh. Hey, pal!I'll always remember our time together. Gotta go!	Where is he? Where is that little rat bastard?
knock, knock-knock, knock, knock...	Eventually, everyone bails.
"Two bits."	knock, knock-knock, knock, knock...
I've been doing some thinking, about how you're always blaming me for everything, and how you just send a constant stream of crap my way...and...I decided I need a break.	If it isn't my favorite career counselor. You wouldn't happen to have any more tips on how to climb _down_ the ladder, would ya?
No. I...came over here to tell you that I traded with another resident and switched off your service for a while.	So, what'd you come by to tell me you're a complete wuss?
I don't think he'd do well in group. So, uh, what's up with Carla?	Come here!
Sure.	I'm starting to think that if she really loved me I'd know by now. Maybe it's time to retreat, protect myself, so I don't get hurt any worse. I really don't want to talk about it, though.
Ahhh, eight strips of bacon! That girl is all _about_ the J.Dizzle.	You're welcome!
Oh, my God, it's pancake man.	Oh, yeah?
"Everybody was kung-fu fighting!" "Those cats were fast as lighten "	Thank you. And Perry, if there's someone in your life at that hell-hole of a hospital who you actually listen to, you should do everything in your power to keep them around. Because that person is nothing short of a genius.
Hi, yeah, I'm stuck in the elevator?	Bat Cave.
Because you did this!	Yeah.... I'm afraid it might be a little while.
Hello?	Aw, now, I think we both know you did this to yourself. Well, I'll let you go.
Did you just climb down an elevator shaft to torment me?	Yeahp. Incoming.How you doing.
Look, I promise you the "door open" button was not working.	Well, sometimes in life you gotta do what you gotta do.
Oh, hey, Dr. Cox! Good to see you!	Mm-hmm. No, it's okay. We're gonna be able to work this thing out, seriously.Put your hands together like you're praying.
Fine.	Oh, for God's sake, Lilly, stop being such a complete wuss and come back to work with me!
The second that Dr. Cox patted me on the shoulder, I thought about how he always shows up in the nick of time.	Oh, just give him a pat on the back he's been wanting it since day one.Just do it!
I guess, in the end, everything comes down to timing.Sometimes, you just have one moment to seize it.	Hey, I'll hang on to this!
And if your timing is good, and it works out for you, make sure you cherish it. Because bad timing can mess up everything.	You shut up.
Oh, come on, this is the only way to celebrate, right? With close friends...and...Nurse Roberts....	Good save.Thank you very much for coming out tonight, guys.
I said "no shellfish."	Oh, hey, now, don't get all pissy now. You said "My treat, order whatever you want." You didn't say "order whatever you want except the lobster."
I wasn't really mad. This was great except for one thing.	I said "no shellfish."
Sure, Paul was dating Elliot. But, luckily, I'm not the jealous type.	You're absolutely right!
Okay, I'll, uh, I'll go ahead and and make a little toast, here. Uh, a toast that only people that've known...Turk and Carla more than a week will understand. You guys rock. You do.	Sure, Paul was dating Elliot. But, luckily, I'm not the jealous type.
How's that taste, Blondie!	Okay, I'll, uh, I'll go ahead and and make a little toast, here. Uh, a toast that only people that've known...Turk and Carla more than a week will understand. You guys rock. You do.
Lame! This guy.	You guys, you know, I've just gotten to know you as a couple, but you remind me of my grandparents. They were married for sixty-five years, and every night before Grandpa and Grandma would walk around the block, he would look deep into her eyes as if to say, "I'd follow you anywhere." Anyway, the way you two just looked at each other, I could have sworn I was looking at them.
We missed another tumor?	Dr. Dorian, how is it this whole hospital gets up in arms every time our MRI machine misses a tumor, but every morning our lousy coffee machine spits out warm urine and nobody gives two hoots!?
Yes, Doctor.	Well, Mr. Simms, it could be because it's damp out. It could also be because, four days ago, I sliced your chest open with a giant knife. You had surgery, buddy, you'll be fine.Hey, Dr. Dorian, I have a couple of minutes off. Would you like me to show you that technique I was telling you about?
You can't teach that.	See, now, what you want to do is choke up on the club like this? And then hit this bad boy like a baseball!
So, what was up with Mr. Simms back there?	No you cannot, my friend. No you cannot!
Are you gonna tell him?	Ahhh, during his open-lung biopsy, I accidentally nicked his intercostal artery, and now he's got a hematoma.
Yeah, but...don't you believe in bad karma?	What, and risk a lawsuit? Are you crazy? Besides, it'll heal just fine, anyway. Hey, throw me another ball.
I dunno. Me, I think karma keeps the universe in order.	Hot cuppa lava, coming through.Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaggggggggggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!
Righty-o.	Karma, schmarma. Now listen, if you're not getting the length on the drive that you need, a lot of the better pros take a running start.
Oh, my God! Do _not_ say "splotchy."	Morning, sport.
Good splotchy, Dr. Splotchy.	Oh, my God! Do _not_ say "splotchy."
There she is! Are you ready to be born today! Jeebeedeebeejeebee....	Dammit!
Enjoy your special day.	Get the hell away from my stomach, or I'll put you in a leg-lock and snap your little bird-neck with my enormous thighs.
I said, "Not pregnant." Is this thing on? And hey! What is the deal with Q-Tips? They're not Qs, and they're not tips!Uhhh, but unfortunately, the CAT-scan suggests a laceration in your spleen, which is why I asked for a surgical consult. So, how'd this happen, anyway?	'Cause you're.... 'Cause you're a.....
This guy's gonna sue the hospital, we're gonna get fired, we'll have to become male whores.Very successful male whores we'll probably have a nicer apartment and some bling-bling, but male whores nonetheless!	What the hell am I doing playing golf!? This is all Tiger Woods' fault.
You and your stupid Christmas present!	Hey, guys! Check out the personalized golf club cozy I found on the roof!"Hi, Davey!"
Wait, wait, wait. Your your windshield's been broken for like a year!	Yeah.... Seems like one of the golf balls you hit went through the windshield of my van. No big deal, I just expect you to replace it, that's all.
No dealio, Ted, we just stopped by to say "Hi." ...Hi.	Hey, fellas! Always nice to have visitors! So, what's the dealio?
We both knew what we had to do.	Later!
Let's come clean.	We both knew what we had to do.
Ever?	Let's not tell anyone! Ever! Ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever! EVER!
I guess it's hard to predict how a person will react.	Ever!
Other times, people react exactly how you think they will.	Well, then, Jordan, why don't we just think of today as as a test run.
What?	Hey, Girl's Name!
Dr. Cox	Gimme a break I got a lot on my mind, Ellen! Ooh! Look at that! I bounced back! A-hey-anyway, the cave bat just kicked me out of its lair, and seeing as I no longer have my all-access pass to crazy town, I'm going to need you to occasionally go in there and poke her with a broomstick, just to see how she's doing.
But what if she has the baby while I'm in there?	Uh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh! Please! Just...check on her, 'kay? All right.
What the hell is that?	Here it comes!
AAAGGGHHH!! GAH! Oh, somebody get it off!!!!!!	Goo-goo, ga-ga! Ga-ga, goo-goo! Goo-goo! Gee-gee! Agh!
I'll check on her later!	AAAGGGHHH!! GAH! Oh, somebody get it off!!!!!!
No thanks.	Oh. Eight hundred.
After being blackmailed, I decided to check in on Jordan.	Come on.... There's still half a deer in the back! I think that's a deer.
Then again, I have other problems. Because I know that some windshield hush-money won't keep the karma gods from coming after Turk and me.	Ow! My face!
Turk! The Dairy Queen burned down!	Apparently my face is scaring my patients, so you're going to take them off my hands for about a week.
Now do you see?	No!
Well, technically it was Dr. Turk.	We were the ones that hit your car with that golf ball.
You know what, it really doesn't matter.	You...liar! Okay, it was _you_!
I...told you it wasn't us.	Down town?
I'm down to one spritz.	I don't know that many straight guys that wear cologne.
Look, Dr. Cox asked me to check in on you; I'm sorry I haven't been here until now.	Hm.
Yep. So...? How ya doin'?	He asked you to...check in on me?
Well, you sound good.	Well, I have ruined everything! All he tried to do was take care of me and show me that he loved me. But, no, I had to drive him away because I don't like being vulnerable even when I'm normal, let alone with my ankles in stirrups and my coochie on display. So, now he's gone away for good; and I would really like to get this stupid thing out of me so I can go home and kill myself!
What are you talking about?	I was going to tell him the truth eventually, I just wanted to see if he was going to be with me because he _wanted_ to, not because he _had_ to. Do you know what I mean?
Apartheid?	Good. ...What're you two talking about?
Call me new agey, but I think karma's a powerful force.	Oh!
Because I honestly believe, if you've got some bad karma coming your way, well...	Dude! It is so nice out here! You mind if I take it down to the banana hammock?
...you can't hide from it.Karma's really just about doing the right thing.	Hi, Dr. Kelso!
....Or about being who you really are.Either way, it's a lot to think about.	So, uh...anyway, Mr. Simms, I wanted to explain to you why your chest was hurting? During surgery, I....
...Yeah....	Oh, my God. Would you look at the mug on Jordan's baby? Must have one butt-ugly father!
Damn you, Karma!	...Yeah....
Okay, fine. I'll just read the wall.	We've been over this before, Newbie eyes front, no talking.
"J.D. has a tiny pickle"?	Okay, fine. I'll just read the wall.
Dr. Cox, I have to tell you something....	Kudos for honesty, there, Newbie but, again, no talking.
Ahoy.	Oh, that's lovely.Huh! Well, hello, sailor.
I may have.	Oh, my goodness, Newbie. Are you so uncomfortable with Jordan here that you've, in fact, stopped peeing mid-stream?
Turk likes to blow off steam by playing basketball before surgery. I always get my ass kicked.... But not today.	Yeah, whatever. Are you gonna stretch before we play basketball, or what?
Grrrrrr.	Turk likes to blow off steam by playing basketball before surgery. I always get my ass kicked.... But not today.
How the hell did we lose?! We have Chet!	And that's game!
Chet, you suck!!!AAARRRGGGHHH!!!You know what, some stereotypes are true, Turk. Okay? And, just maybe, black people are a little better at basketball. Whatta you say?	Sorry, man.
Elliot, you're a doctor stop calling it "twosies."	Oh, I have no idea. I just can't believe you had to pee in front of Jordan! I could _not_ do that. I mean, Paul's my boyfriend, and I make him turn the volume way up on the T.V. when I go. Plus, he's not allowed in the apartment an hour before _or_ after I do twosies.
What?	Oh, with patients I say "dookie." Oh, dookie!
I haven't even started yet.	Well, now, Maggie! I can only assume that you are whiling away the morning cat-chatting with your favorite gal-pal because you've already finished your pre-rounding?
Gotcha! Finished!	What?
I could tell you some stories.	That's a good one, Newbie. My heart is racing. You are quite the prankster.
Well, is there anything I need to do for her lung nodule?	And if there's a God in heaven, you never will. This is Mrs. Gracin's chart her private practice doctor just showed up, so I am off this one.
Great. Another pretentious private practice guy who's gonna order me around while he counts his money all day.	Oh, I don't know. What do you say you start her on 20 CCs of It's not my problem anymore!
Thanks! A latte!	I'm Dr. Fisher I go by Pete. Never call me Petey, we'll be friends for life. Hey, look at this. Don't believe me? Already got you a latte, buddy. Look at that.
How is that funny? Eh, just go with it.	That's funny! We got a good one, Sally!
You know, I'm always pulling pranks, too. Like, before, Dr. Cox was like, "Did you do that pre-rounding?"	How is that funny? Eh, just go with it.
Yeah, we yeah.	You know what I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you; I do want to hear the end of that story, though could you get a pulmonary consult for Sally for me?
Ha!	You're probably thinking, Why didn't you do that before I got here? But you weren't sure if you'd be over-stepping your boundaries. What if I was some sort of territorial ass with a giant ego or a territorial ego with a giant ass. Stop me, Sally, please!
No. "Thank thanks a latte!" Thank thank well 'cau well well "thanks a lot!" I oh, "Thanks a latte"! I got it!	Wanna make him jealous?
I know it sounds insensitive, but let's face it narcolepsy is a funny condition. And it can be triggered by a number of things.... Like stress.	You guys wanna go laugh at the narcoleptic guy?
Or anger, from, say, three double-bogeys in a row.	A kid in a classroom, passed out on top of his test paper.
Or...in Mr. Hilliard's case....	A golf cart being driven across a course by a man slumped over the steering wheel.
Okay, so, first she's gonna stick her chest out...and then she'll toss her hair....	Is falling asleep _after_ sex considered narcolepsy? 'Cause if it is, Mr. Roberts got it.
Oh, that did it.	Oh! Oops!
Oh, you two must already know each other.	Hey, ladies.
Sometimes, when you're in an awkward situation, the best thing to do is to go to your happy place.	Petey.
Oh, Jay! You're so crazy!	...Well, it's not uncommon! I think a lot of people keep, uh, plants in their apartment. Right, J.D.?
What's up his pooper?	We have a little history.... Yeah....
Yeah.	Actually, I think he's mad 'cause I went into private practice and he's stuck in this hell-hole.
That's lame.	You wouldn't believe this, but that guy was my mentor, man. I mean, I lived and breathed for that guy's approval.
Tell me about it.	I know! Once you learn the tricks, though, he's easier to deal with; you'll see.
No, no, I'm serious tell me about it.	Yeah!
No, I do. Now, how do you get him to stop calling you girl's names.	Oh! Ohh. Uh, well, you know when he gets on his rants, he gets all hyped up, his vein starts sticking out of his neck, and he starts yelling at ya when he's done, just look at him, stare him right in the eye, and say, "I'm sorry, what were you saying?"I don't know why, but it works; trust me.
Oh. Nevermind.	Girl's names?
What are you smiling about?	Back at'cha!
Just do it!	Oh, hey, buddy! I was just thinking about you! Yeah, I was thinking how it might be real nice to have somebody around here who could help me out. You know, somebody I could call oh, gosh "My Resident"...and we'd do stuff together. You know, medical stuff. And it would just be peaches! But then it occurred to me that a guy who looked a hell of a lot like you used to be that guy.
I'm sorry...did you say something?	Just do it!
I knew this was his way of reaching out, but still....	I'll tell you what, there, Newbie: If you want to stick around and help me out with Mrs. Riley's pericardiocentesis after work, that'd be great.
I have plans tonight.	I knew this was his way of reaching out, but still....
Okay, think of something believable. Grandma died! No, no, no, no, don't do that...because if she does die, you'll feel awful; and, let's face it, she's no spring chicken. I should call her. But then, whenever we talk, I have nothing to say how 'bout asking me how I am for once!	Oh, what plans!?
My grandma died!	Newbie!
Three-day weekend!	Nancy, the kid's a doctor, for crying out loud! He saves lives! That's worthy of your respect, or at least one drunken weekend in Vegas.
Everyone deals with problems in their own way.Some lash out at others......some just end up lashing out at themselves......and some people just try to hide.	Three-day weekend! Columbus day! That's coming up, right? Come on!
Unfortunately, that never works.	Nancy! Nancy.
Look, I know that he's in private practice and everything, but Pete's actually a really cool guy.	Did we just slip into some alternate dimension where I actually give a flying ducky about what you say and do?
Ohhh, my God! You're actually jealous that I'm hanging out with another doctor!	He is a bad guy; and Newbie, if you're smart, you'll stay away from him.
Laverne?	No, I'm _not_.
Ta-DOW!	Jealous!
Don't worry about it, champ. It's all right to need me.	Look, Marcia, if I were you, I'd drop this jealousy thing right now.
I'm gonna ask him an innocuous little question, and his answer will be filled with hate. Just filled with it!How's it goin'?	He is such a sweetie!
Do you not see the hate?	Very well, sir! Thank you for asking! How are you?
That was a good one.	What is wrong with you?
He's doing it!	I think so.All right, go.Hold it! Nah.
Hey! Do you guys mind if I turn on CNN? My grandma bought me a stock I wanna see how it's doing.	No, how 'bout you never mention Jordan again.
Cool! These guys are finally starting to get along!...Or not.	Look at Rockefeller! Pass me the remote, buddy!
Or...we could just...leave it on this station....	No big deal! I'll, uh, you know, do one of these change the channel.
Watching Dr. Cox and Pete fight over me was aw, hell, I'll say it: It was awesome!	Okay! Terrific! Grown-ups tackle each other all the time.
That seemed a little possessive...but I'm flattered!	You went ahead and took something that did not belong to you.
Ahh, he just wouldn't be Dr. Cox if he didn't refer to me as a 'her.'	And worse than that, you did it knowing full-well just exactly how I felt about her.
That's a lie! You bought me a latte!Hey, guys.	Hey, for what it's worth, I didn't make the first move.
And, finally, the reason Dr. Cox and his wife got divorced became abundantly clear.	Go.
I guess sometimes it comes down to loyalty.	Ohh, I get it, all right you're still in Perr-a-reeno's corner. But that's okay, buddy! Look, just a word to the wise, all right? Just be careful who you hitch your wagon to. I mean that. Yikes! I gotta go, okay?Hi! Could I buy you a house?
Hey, Dr. Cox!	I guess sometimes it comes down to loyalty.
That you're allowed to talk?	Still no talking in the bathroom, Newbie.You know what's weird?
Who cares if Jordan wants to keep it a secret? Tell him it's his baby! Scream it from the mountains!	I never blamed Jordan. I was a chief resident, I was here all the time, and I always made damn-sure she knew she came second. But, God almighty, I'm trying harder this time. I just hope I'm doing the right thing, you know?
DR. COX!	Who cares if Jordan wants to keep it a secret? Tell him it's his baby! Scream it from the mountains!
Hey, Jordan. How' ya doin'?	Hi, handsome. How are you?Oh! Hello, D.J.
Around here, you have to grab hold of the littlest victories.Whether it's victories over your insecurities....	Oh!
...or security's victories over you.	Doc-Doc-Dr. Kelso?
Either way, you gotta choose your battles.	Dr. Kelso!
I want you to tell her the truth, dammit. All right? Tell her that you're a surly, devious, horrible excuse for a human being!Who's that?	Either way, you gotta choose your battles.
I-I'm sorry. I di no, I didn't even see him there, I	Oh, my God, J.D.!
I'm so sorry.	No, no, no, I'm...I'm glad he heard it. I think it's important he sees how the world treats people like us.
Okay. Fo'shizzle. What's up, girl.	You close your eyes way too early. And you always go in right; you should try going in left the girls'll dig that.
Also, it would be super fantastic if you never mention this to anyone, ever.	Ohhh.
It's weird, ever since they got engaged, Turk and Carla have been arguing constantly.	To everybody!
You want some kibble?	It's weird, ever since they got engaged, Turk and Carla have been arguing constantly.
I guess I always hoped that, the longer you're a couple, the easier it got....	You want some kibble?
Maybe the truth is that it's easier to be a new couple, because you can't really see what's ahead of you.	You're gonna have to trust me on this one: Seeing as you're his mother, he's gonna hear that word early, and he's gonna hear it often. Like...non-stop!
In the end, the safest thing for a couple is to find a routine and stick with it.	Don't take the blindfold off! I'll, uh, I'll get a towel to stop the bleeding!
Honestly, it all makes me glad I'm on my own. I really don't think I'd have it any other	Ugh.
Hello, ladies. Just window shopping, or would you like to try something on?	Honestly, it all makes me glad I'm on my own. I really don't think I'd have it any other
Carla...a quick word?Is anybody else a doctor?	Uh, aren't you the guy that makes out with dogs?
T.C.W. is a horrible story.She was married for three weeks before her husband got in a car accident and became a total vegetable. He's been on life support for the last two years; and since he was transferred to our hospital a month ago, she's visited every Wednesday. Very, very sad.Oh, yeah, and she's a babe! We call her "Tasty Coma Wife" or "T.C.W." for short.	Dude! T.C.W.'s back.
You know...he's he's the same. How are you doing?	How's he doing?
I think you're allowed to do whatever you want, Mrs. Moyer.	Actually, I was just calculating how much time I need to spend here so I don't feel guilty all week.... And now I need to double it, because I can't believe I just said that.
"Jamie"?	Please, call me Jamie.
Okay.	Mm-hmm.
What is it?	You have something on your cheek.
Workin' in a hospital...it's always...something.	Here.
Oh. Did you get it?	Yeah, I get it.
Oh! We're excellent, sir. No one going to hell in here!	How we doin' today?
Did _you_ go to med school?	Can you really hear my heart if it if it isn't in your ears?
No, you didn't. Thank you.	No, I...I...I No, I mean
Okay, the problem is that I'm in a rut. I just need someone to go out and get a beer with me.	No, you didn't. Thank you.
Oh, come on, player, just a few beers! And if we accidentally run into some skanky hos, then so be it!	Sorry, buddy, can't swing it tonight.
Not that I need any help.	I'll go.I totally need to blow off some steam. Plus, the best way to meet skanky hos is to already have a girl with you.
Heh.	Pff! Hell no!
Oh?	You got something right....
I'm still not sure how I feel about Paul and Elliot.Uh-oh....	Thank you.Ow! Every lunch, someone hits me with a spit-ball.
Nice day, huh?	I'm still not sure how I feel about Paul and Elliot.Uh-oh....
O...kay, I'm I'm sorry about the "nice day" thing. How can I make this right?	You always gotta have something to say, don't ya? Old nosy nelly, always gotta throw his two cents in.
Yeah.	What's it, uh, biscuit and gravy day?
I thought you were ready.	Just give me one of them biscuits.
And your job as chum is to lure attractive women closer to the boat.	Okay.
Mental note: "The Boat" could be a very cool new nickname.	And your job as chum is to lure attractive women closer to the boat.
No, no, Jamie. A little	Look at that mmm.
a little aggressive! Sorry.	Yeah?
No, no, no.... Her ass was way too perfect.	Did you like her?
I'm glad!	I can't believe I'm actually having fun!
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry; I've heard some idiots call you that.	So, "Tasty Coma Wife," huh?
I thought it up.	I kinda like it.
People in relationships are always quick to dole out advice, even though they're usually the ones that are messed up.	One hundred free booger suckers and you'll say nothing.
Whether they're considering breaking up over a Slim Jim......or having their stomach pumped...	See ya, Elliot.
...or just desperately trying to get some attention.	Ahhhhhhhh!
So, I'm not gonna sweat it just because I made a new friend, you know? I mean, what's the big deal?	Oh.
Hey.	Hey!
Jamie, you've got a lot going on right now. I'm sure you're...a little confused....	He must smell my dead dog.So, you still haven't asked me why I called the hospital, pretended to be your sister, got your home address, and showed up in the middle of the night.
Holy crap!	It's time for me to start my life over. And I would love to take you out to dinner, if you would be interested.
Jack?	Jack wouldn't want my life to be over.
Mr. Moyer!	My husband.
I'd rather not.	Call him Jack.
Of course.	I know it's weird. But give it some thought, okay?
Hey.	Hey!
Yeah.	All right, I'll see ya.
Yeah....	Dude! Was thatWas that Tasty Coma Wife?
Oh, thanks, Jack.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!	Here you go.
Cold chart. Brrrrr! Heh.	What?
Good cover!	Cold chart. Brrrrr! Heh.
"Chink."	Five letters. "Showing vulnerability. 'A blank in one's armor'"...?
"Chink!"Oh, no, no. No, Franklyn, we were we were, um, we were doing a crossword puzzle, and....	What?
Franklyn, no!	We all did.
I think at a certain point, breast-feeding becomes creepy.	Ohh, you like milk, do ya? Hah. Why don't you get on your bike and go down to the store and get some.
It doesn't show.	Benji, come.What is with these mothers doting on their children? My God! It's like...it's like nobody else even exists in the world anymore! But I tell you one thing and you damn sure take it to the bank my mother never paid that much attention to me.
Oh, you're imagining things.	Word to the wise, there, Astro: Sarcasm does not sit well with the Big Dog, so consider this a warning. Because the next time I hear you mumble some snarky little passive-aggressive aside, I'm going to look into your heart, pick out your greatest insecurity, and shine the world's brightest spotlight on it for the remainder of your natural-born days. Now, riddle me this, Fido: Just exactly why does every Asian person who's passing us by in the hallway, here, keep giving you the old stink-eye?
Ow.It's just been sorta hard for me lately, you know? I don't really have anyone special in my life, and...I'm pretty much either here or at home doing nothing, and....	Oh.
What? No nothing. It's a...new therapy.	What are you doing?
'Course.	Oh.J.D., you'd trust me on something that was important to me, right?
I don't know what I was thinking.	Elliot! We're talking about dried meat, here! Why would you get in the middle of this?
No, this is just a...pen. "Pink scrubs"....	Is that a straw in your pocket?
Or ridiculously closed-minded and inappropriate....	Son, a hospital staff is like a melting pot! We all need to respect each other. Now, if you think that a specific ethnic group is loud or lazy or sneaky....
What? It's not my fault! Ralphie! Let's ride.Good work, buddy. Here's your twenty bucks. So you can really throw up whenever you want to?	Well, maybe what you should do instead is saddle up your mop and head upstairs someone has vomited in the second, third, and fifth floor hallways.
We should probably look into that.... You know, right after you blow chunks in the elevator.	Hell, yeah!
It's weird realizing that you missed someone you barely know.	Hot!
Hey!Wait! Make me proud!	It's weird realizing that you missed someone you barely know.
You be quiet!	I'm free, and I love Italian!
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! And shut up! Okay? Who are you people to give me advice about anything? All you do is just bitch about your relationships all day long!	Oh, Rin-Tin-Tin-Tin-Tin-Tin-Tin!
Ah, nothing. I just I love Chinese food...and...the Asian people! What should we do now?	But what was the deal with tipping twenty dollars on a thirty dollar bill?
I could do that.	...Kiss me.
Thank you, Rowdy!	Mm! You went left! Very cool.
Uhh.... Honestly, I think you you might be moving a little fast for yourself. And there's a part of me that's very angry I just said that.	So, it's cold outside you wanna come back to my place?
I'll tell you what, if you look me in the eyes and you tell me that you're really ready to start something right now....we won't even need a cab I will, like, I will throw you over my shoulder and just sprint the twelve miles to your house!...But....	I'm so sick of being alone, you know?
I hope you do.	I'll call you sometime.
I don't think people are meant to be by themselves.That's why, if you actually find someone you care about......it's important to let go of the little things....Even if you can't let go all the way.Because nothing sucks more than feeling all alone...no matter how many people are around.	Bye.
Ohhh, Rudy, can you lose the grapefruit goggles?	Hey!
Well, that's a risk you take with that particular piece of fruit.You guys, come on! What do you say we dial down the whole power-nerd thing a little bit, okay?	But it squirts in my eyes.
Ohh, is that tomorrow?	Hey, J.D., are you starting your surgical elective tomorrow?
Whatever. I don't really give a crap.Take a picture! Take a picture!! And you better smile this time.	Yeah!
Hey, um, Carla, do you think you could cut these for me? Because I've been working out so much, these things are choking off my pythons , you know?	You guys look so cute!
Janeane's built like a bear. She curled me once.	Yeah, I wouldn't do that. At the end of the week, you gotta return these bad boys to, uh, Janeane!
Entering the hospital as a surgeon has a whole different feel to it.	Janeane's built like a bear. She curled me once.
How amazing was that morning....	Dude. You okay? You're acting weirder than the time we saw Pat Benetar at StarBucks.
Come on, man	Listen, do me a favor: don't try to overdo it with these guys, all right? Just be you, okay?
you know how I do!What's up, fellas. Look, I know I'm usually Medical, I just want you guys to know I consider you all me pee-pees.	Be yourself.
They know you mean "peeps"! Just change the subject!	you know how I do!What's up, fellas. Look, I know I'm usually Medical, I just want you guys to know I consider you all me pee-pees.
Whoa! Somebody's been working out!	They know you mean "peeps"! Just change the subject!
Help me!	What?
Morning, Captain.So, am I the first guy they've done this to?	Morning, sport.
Who's Frank Fratchman?	Nah, man! They did this to Frank Fratchman.
Help me!	Okay, you're the first one.
Ow!	Yeah.
Okay.	All right, don't sweat it, okay? Stay on your toes.
Ohhhh, man!	Dude, your face. Your face.
Huh! How did they get that on there, dawg?	Yeah, let's lose the tail, too.
Oooooo!	Buddy I got your back
No problem. All right, people, how long till we get this thing started?	but lay low for a while.
Turk's always looking out for me.	All right, J.D., get in there.
Oh, my God.... Here, it's my first day in surgery, and I'm actually holding a human heart!	Told you I'd hook you up.
We we were done with that one, right guys?What'cha got there?	Oh, my God.... Here, it's my first day in surgery, and I'm actually holding a human heart!
Why would you need a saw in a hospital?	A new circular saw just bought it! Four horse-power, thirty-five hundred RPMs, titanium finger guard....
Why _does_ an old hen need a banjo?	Why would an old hen need a banjo?
You wouldn't! That'd be crazy.	Why would I buy a saw if I didn't have stuff to cut?
No thank you, I'm fine.	Exactly!Need some help with that?
...but I was in Surgery now.Still, even though Turk was trying to help, I felt like such an outsider.	Aaaaand...now!
Turk did ballet!	or your _boyfriend_?Hahaha! Whazzup!
Actually....	I just I just used it to help with my agility for sports, that's all...you know! I...I never wore the clothes or anything like that.
I get you! Okay, who wants some more? You got okay! There's some!	Dude! Close the door! Close close the door!
To the gun show, dawg!Heeeeeeeeey!	To what?
Sometimes you just can't help but get caught up in the moment. And when that happens, you never know what you're gonna do.	To the gun show, dawg!Heeeeeeeeey!
...Or what you're gonna say to someone.	Oh, I'm afraid Dr. Kelso has passed away.
But if things are going well, you should just ride the wave.	Me neither.
Hey, T-Dog! Who we slicing and dicing today?	But if things are going well, you should just ride the wave.
What? Why?	Well, J-Dog, I don't know who you're slicing and dicing I assigned you to another surgeon.
Ted!	You deserve Ted's Band today / So get up and get away....
You guys suck.	To
Oh, I'm sorry, Todd. Is it time to excise the tumor?	J.D., are you even paying attention?
And then I realized why Turk was so pissed he was the geek now.	No! It is time to realize that we are operating on a naked chick! We will high-five later!
Yeah, man! I'll just talk to 'em. You know, Shmitty, Schultzy, Trigger, Fig-sack, Small Pete, Little Pete, Tiny Pete, The Jackal, Aardvark, and Steve!	Oh, can you? Really? Totally?
Oh, yeah, we all went out last night, and I sorta made up some new nicknames for all the fellas. By the way, you're "Slappy-bag."	Dude, who the hell are you talking about?
Come on! Slappy-bag!	You've lost it.
Told ya you had nothing to saw.	Don't call me "Slappy-bag"!
Oww, man! Give it back!	Oh, really?
No!	All right. Just tell me why you're hitting yourself.Hm? Why you doing that?You ever get the feeling we're thinking the same thing?
Look, I'm sorry I told all the surgeons about your ballet thing.	That's a great set, Arnold. You got a little stringy thing hanging from your sleeve, there. Oh, I'm sorry that's your arm!
Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah? Not all surgeons are stupid, okay! Think-sack, here, went to Dartmouth!Oh, wait, you're Aardvark.	You were so desperate for the approval of all these stupid surgeons that you sold me down the river, huh?
Smitty?	Mm-mm.
You see that? You see that right there? That has never happened to me a hot girl has _never_ asked to buy me a drink.Apple-tini please easy on the -tini.	No, I'm good. Thank you.
Man! Ever since college, you always make everything seem so easy. No matter where you are, you always fit in. I dunno, I guess I thought with this surgery elective, it might be nice not to feel like a total dork for once.	No problem, lady.
Not all the time!	J.D., look at me. You are a dork.
Hey, I'm J.D.! I'm so stoked to be your roommate! Right on!	Every second, since the moment I met you.
What are you talking about? I thought you said hoops were cool? Hey, baby! Cham-pahg-nee?Med school chicks love ventriloquists!	To go along with his cap and gown, J.D. has gotten his ear pierced with a huge gold ring.
Tannest intern, baby! And it comes in a bottle!	J.D. is orange.
Apple-tini, please. Easy on the -tini.	A few minutes ago.
And that's why you hung out with me?	See, J.D., the thing that I always liked about you was that you were just yourself you never cared about what people thought.
Come on, player! You know I'm way more stud than dud!Wow, you can really taste the apples!	No, you had a car. Still do.
I think everyone would like to believe it's possible to become someone different.... To change how people see us.	Come on, player! You know I'm way more stud than dud!Wow, you can really taste the apples!
But sometimes change doesn't last for long.	Well, what'd he do with the new one?
And other times, just makes you miss what you had....a little.As for me, I'm happy just knowing who I am.	By golly, you're so pretty, I may not even use you!
No problem, Dougster.	Hey, J.D.? Do you have any nasal spray?
For I am John Dorian King of the Nerds!	Yeah!
I think Dr. Cox would be more willing to help if he knew it was his baby.	So not Gustav! Busy doctor!
It's not my place to tell!	Whatta you say, there, Stephanie; how about _you_ step up to the plate and tell the guy. My God! I'm only three weeks old, and already I've got more stones than you do and one of mine hasn't even dropped yet.
Oh, I gotta get to that funeral.	Newbie, I know that your ovaries are absolutely tingling at the very sight of this little fella, but you gotta snap out of it!
Well...I'm gonna get going.	Listen, later on, if you have trouble getting the baby to sleep? Just tell him that story. Yeah.
Luckily, no one else'll bust my chops about the funeral. Because around here, you tend to get wrapped up in your own world.Whether you're trying to plan your day...	Well...I'm gonna get going.
...or trying to live out your deepest fantasies.	Should I take a dookie before or after I lift weights? Mmmm....after!
...Maybe you're trying to break in the soles of your new Italian shoes...	Dammit! Don't you die on me! Clear! Kgh-bgghhhh!
...or break down the spirit of your old whipping boy.	Sir, those shoes look a little small for you.
One way or another, everyone finds a way to make it all about themselves.	Not lately. But when I do, it's reflection perfection!
Isn't he fixing the heat down in Pediatrics?	I gotta fix my own damn copy machine 'cause the maintenance man claims he's got more important things to do!
As for me, no matter what Dr. Cox thinks, I wasn't going to that funeral to hit on Jamie.......I was going to pay my respects.	Whatever!
Well, you look fantastic! And, you know, I don't mean "Hey, dude, check out that hot bitty at the bar!" 'fantastic' I'm talking about "I'm sorry for your loss" 'fantastic'.	J.D.! I'm so happy you came!
Yeah, let's get the hell out of here.	Do you wanna grab a drink?
Oh, yeah, I know! So so was I.	Oh, I was actually talking about him.
Somebody's a smoker!	Oh, no! You have to order he's bussing those.
Just get out without doing any more damage.	Thanks again for coming.
I had a blast.	Just get out without doing any more damage.
Nice job!	I had a blast.
I'll see ya.	Well...goodbye....
Oh! Oh! Heh. I'm sorry, everyone. I...I dropped something on my toe. "Ahhhhhh!...AHHAAAAHHHH!" ...You know.... Carry on.	Whoops!
You know, Jamie, there are a lot of ways to grieve. Um.... But, last time I checked, wheelbarrow-style wasn't one of them.	J.D., we've been over this. I loved my husband, but he's been dead to me for two years. I mean, I can't tell you how happy I am to finally have some closure. ...And my first orgasm in, like, forever!
You've never been more confused.	I am okay, J.D. I'm really seeing things clearly.
You're sad.	I'm happy!
You're at war!	I'm at peace.
Unfortunately, Mr. Mueller doesn't speak a word of English.	So, you caught sight of the Janitor's window crank, and think you may have seen a little melanoma on there? Hmm! Well, then, it's your obligation as a doctor and your privilege as a woman to go back and ask him if you can't see it one more time. Now, 'course I'd love to help, but I'm off to baby-sit the only other being on God's green earth who's needier than you. And, in the meantime, I need you to go in and tell Mr. Mueller that his liver has lesions on it and it doesn't look good.
Hi, Mr. Mueller.	Unfortunately, Mr. Mueller doesn't speak a word of English.
I don't know. This is so frustrating! I just wish there was some way we could connect!Nah, that would never work.	Danke! Nurse Roberts: What he "danke"in' you for?
How come you're not unzipped?	Can I take your order?
Look, uh..........JanitorI'm gonna be straight with you: I saw your penis, and I noticed a possible melanoma that you should really have checked out.	'Cause I'm not peeing! This is where I come to take my breaks. If I stand around out there, everyone tells me to do stuff.
Last night, when you were showering.	When did you see my penis?
Oh, I was outside, in the bushes.	Where were you?
Look, it was just a coincidence, man I mean, i-i-if you had looked out the window, you'd have seen my penis, you know!	Uhhh....
Because I had it out while I was looking at yours!	What!?! Why?
Okay, regroup.	Because I had it out while I was looking at yours!
Hermann the German! You must get that all the time!	Hey, you must be Dr. Dorian. I am, uh, Rolf's brother, Hermann.
Oh.	No, first time....
Uh, well, uh, I could really use your help translating.	Let's hope it catches on!
Uh, I got the, uh, results back from your biopsy...	Oh, sure.
...the lesions in your liver...	Wir werden dich zu einem...
...are... consistent with metastatic pancreatic cancer.	Es sieht so aus, als ob du...
It's not good.	Eh, what is the prognosis?
The key to any good relationship is communication.	Es wird alles gut gehen.Okay.
If you're not open with someone, it's gonna catch up with you.	Hey!
If you're not honest, you'll end up getting busted.	This is so weird I could swear that while I was in surgery, I heard you describing these sexy dreams about someone named Elliot!
Eh, but what do I know about good relationships? Two days ago, I had funeral sex.	No. Can I see that?
You speak German?	Hey! I just met your patient, Mr. Mueller; we had such a nice chat.
Germans!	Yeah! I can do a sweet little milkmaid: Guten Morgen, möchten Sie die Kühe melken?I can do an evil old hausfrau : ESS DEIN SCHNITZEL, SONST KRIEGST DU KEIN NACHTISCH! J.D.: German's such a beautiful language.... Anyhoo, I think Mr. Mueller's so amazing. I mean, yesterday, I pretty much told him he was gonna die; and his brother turned to him and he said, "Es wird alles wieder gut." And Mr. Mueller just accepted it!Well, why wouldn't he? "Es wird alles wieder gut" means "You're going to be fine."
You mind telling me why you lied to your brother about this ____ condition!?	He said, "As soon as I get home, I'm eating an entire chocolate cake."
Fine, just tell him that lying to his brother isn't gonna make him any better!	He said,He didn't want to upset his brother, jackass!
His Biliary obstruction's relieved, and he's taking P.O.	We got Mr. Mueller's ultrasound back.
Da!	That's good, yes?
...And now, Mr. Mueller's doing so much better, I'm not even sure telling him the truth about his pancreatic cancer is even the best thing for him.	Uh-huh, and speaking of crunching, I have been jonesing for some Double-Stuff Oreos all day. Why don't you see if you can't hook me up?
No she's not!	So, what you're saying is that you have a problem that is totally your problem, but you'd like to find a way to make that problem my problem. But here's the problem, Newbie: it's not my problem. So whatta you say we stop talking about the Janitor's junk; I'd like to hear nahsing about ze German; and don't even mention Tasty Coma Wife, even though I know she's on your mind.
No thanks.	Well, since we are sharing: I have to go home and face Jordan and tell her that I didn't ditch her little hatchling on account of being lazy I did it because, whenever I'm alone with that child, do you know what I feel? Nothing.
And then he said something I never expected to hear.	Benign...be nine and a half....
Not that I totally expected that.	I don't like you.
I'm a doctor. I had to tell you what was going on.	...But, I know this was uncomfortable, and, uh, I appreciate your concern.
It's funny how one person can lead you to another. I mean, I knew Mr. Mueller's brother shouldn't have tried to protect him, and yet I was doing the same thing to someone else.	"...always thinking he knows what's best for me."
Excuse me, Jamie?	It's funny how one person can lead you to another. I mean, I knew Mr. Mueller's brother shouldn't have tried to protect him, and yet I was doing the same thing to someone else.
I treated a patient today who was mad at his brother for presuming to know what's best for him. And that got me thinking. Because I was freaking out that we hooked up in the closet at the funeral, I did the same thing to you! So...if you're really ready, let's go for it! 'Cause, I'm crazy about you, and you're right your husband's gone, and he's never coming back!	J.D.? Wha ?
Who are these lovely people?	Uhh.
Oh, God. How can I make this right?If only....	These are my late husband's parents.
Eggs. You know, one minute they're bad for you, now everybody's like, "Hey, have you tried eggs? Th-They-They're great!" It's c it's crazy. Every ...eggs are....	What are you thinking about?
What?	You know what? Forget I asked.
Sweetie, it is!Now, exactly how much feeling am I supposed to lose in my extremities?	J.D., I really wanted tonight to be romantic.
Still, things are going pretty well with me and Jamie.	Just enough so it still hurts.
Oh, no, this a a rash from my new watch. They didn't tell me the band was made out of....cat.	Looks like rope-burn to me.
Hm?	This is exactly like the dress I bought! Huh!
Shorts, huh?	What? I think Vera Wang makes very beautiful gowns. Plus, her last name is a very funny word for "penis." Who's with me? Air-five! Stsh! Stsh! Stsh!
I didn't say "lowly."	Yeah. What, I don't get to wear shorts, 'cause I'm just a lowly janitor?
Yes! Have you been drinking?	Oh, so now I'm a janitor?
I love your shorts, okay? I wish I had a pair just like 'em.	I'm not _drunk_.
It's on you, pardner!	Okay, Mr. Westfeld, now the angioplasty went well, but here's the thing: It is on you, pardner. You gotta start watching what you eat so that we can kick this thing in the ass. Okay?
Is that a gay joke?	Oh, gosh, Shannon, thank you _so much_ for clarifying my point by repeating it word for word. And now, in a reciprocal gesture, can I be included in the planning of your coming out party?
Man, once Dr. Cox gets on a roll, there's nothing that can derail him.	No, it's a cotillion joke. My God, Newbie, it's been two furiously frustrating years how is it possible that you still don't get me? I would never compare you to the gays! I like the gays I like their music, I like their sense of style, I especially like what they've done with Halloween but _our thing_ is that you are a _little girl_. That's who you are! But that's really not fair....
Except that.	My mom died.
Do I like 'em? Why, just the other day, I was asking myself, "How can I display my package in a way that's both alluring and professional?"	So, anyway, you said you liked mine, and I had the wife whip you up a pair of your own! You like 'em?
Ugh.	Well, there's your answer!
Oh, I'm ready.	Are you ready for bed?
A lot can change in a week.	Oh, I'm ready.
Uh, ew.	Scoot.Can you hand my mouth guard to me?
Things haven't fizzled, all right? Last night we made ice cubes out of orange juice, so step off!	J.D., if things have fizzled that much, I mean, I could scout her out for you, try to figure out the problem.
Wow.... The past and the present.	Wouldn't know skipped it. But my aunt told my father it was very moving. Oh, gosh.
Whenever I see two beautiful women that I've been intimate with talking to each other, I always have the same fantasy....	Wow.... The past and the present.
Mm!What are you two talking 'bout?	Come on, ladies! It's right hand, left hand, shoulder-pop, jump! Right hand, left hand, shoulder-pop, jump!
I tell her way too much.	_Not_ the Rerun Dance.
Oh, thanks!	You left some stuff in my apartment.
Mmm....	See ya.
We're doing fine!	You wanna know why things with Jamie are so 'lamey'?
Wrong! She just came by because she knows today at work, I need my......squash goggles.	Oh, please! She's clearing you out of her apartment!
I have to saw something later.	Mm.
Well, Jamie is not like you, okay!?	She's a drama queen, J.D.! When her husband was in a coma, it was all, like, taboo and exciting; but now that it's okay for the two of you to be together, the relationship's got no snap...it's got no crackle. J.D.... It's got no pop. I know! Because I'm a drama queen, too!
Ditditditdit!	No Pop!
Why are we whispering?	Shhhhhh! Calm down. I didn't mean to scare you.
I think I would.	I wanted to see if you would whisper because I whispered.
Yeah, I know. I was gonna wear 'em, but you know someone went and stole them out of my locker!	Anyway, what's the deal? We're supposed to be shorts buddies today. You saw the schedule: Monday-Tuesday, shorts; Wednesday, we wash 'em; Thursday-Friday, shorts; weekend, optional I'll be wearing shorts.
Yes!	What?
As a doctor, you get good at thinking on your feet. I was able to protect the Janitor's feelings, plus, he totally bought it!	Let me see!
You're already wearing sweats.	Yeah, you know, I'm actually gonna go put my sweats on.
Look, she probably does have to get up early, so just be cool.	You know what, I gotta get up kinda early, so maybe you should just crash at your place tonight.
I'm so sorry! It was a total accident, I just...I just	Look, she probably does have to get up early, so just be cool.
Oh, my God! She does want drama!	Don't lie to me! I asked you to go, so you punched in my coffee table, didn't you.
Sometimes you make me so crazy!	Oh, my God! She does want drama!
This is totally normal. I mean, in relationships, you have to roll with the punches! Even the ones you don't see coming....	Come here. I'll take care of you.
Ahh, that is romantic. So, how pregnant is she?	She says it's romantic to be spontaneous.
Really? Which one?	She's not pregnant!Man, I was getting really psyched for this whole wedding, man the dancing, the band, you woulda hooked up with one of Carla's sisters!
Nice!	The drunkest one.
That woulda been awesome!	Dude!
As for my relationship, I was doing anything I could to keep the drama alive.	Praise Jesus!
Look, Jamie and I are gonna be together, and I don't care what you think, Mom!	As for my relationship, I was doing anything I could to keep the drama alive.
Because I don't want salad, that's why!Look, Jamie and I are gonna be together, and I don't care what you think, Dad!	On a date with Jamie, J.D. talks forcefully to the waiter.
I'm warning you! Stop eyeballing my woman!	Jamie is cuddled up to J.D. as he forcefully addresses a midget.
No, it was definitely that guy!	Actually, J.D., I think it was that guy!
Unfortunately, I was running out of ideas.	No, it was definitely that guy!
I don't know. How are you? Zinnnnng!	So, how's the drama queen doing?
Because you're not right!	Why can't you just admit that I'm right?
I wouldn't stoop this low for drama.	What the hell was that all about?
Well, we used to be a couple, and now that you're in the picture? Guess who wants me back!	I wouldn't stoop this low for drama.
Fine, I'd stoop!	Well, we used to be a couple, and now that you're in the picture? Guess who wants me back!
I can totally explain why Jamie said that. You know how Turk always says "hey, player" when he means "hey, buddy"?	Hey, slut!
Well, Jamie's from Cincinnati, and in Cincinnati they say, "Hey, slut!"	Yeah...?
Uh, Carla, could you give, uh, me and Elliot a second? I gotta talk to her privately.Thank you!Hey, uh, I just wanted to say, you were right about Jamie.	Excuse me?
Asking you not to show up at my apartment drunk, naked, and crying. You know what's weird? I really like this girl, but I'm not sure I can keep it going with all the drama.	Uh-huh. And what does Jamie think you're doing over here?
Yeah.	I think you just have to gamble that once all the drama's gone, there's still gonna be something there. If not, it's her loss.
Thanks.	Still, if it helps:
Augh!	I don't know. Although, it smells a little bit like....The Truth!
She just cut off a pair of scrubs and hemmed the bottom. What's the big deal?	My poor wife _slaved_ over these!
Look, I'm sorry, okay? For...so many things. But, I'm a doctor I can't really wear shorts to work.	What's the big deal? Well, the Good Lord didn't bless my wife with all ten fingers. She's only got pointer...and...thumb-pinkie.
Nope.	Can't wear shorts to work?
Not allowed!	Can't wear shorts to _work_?
Oh, nothing. I'm just trying to mend some fences.	Thanks. What's up with the man-____?
Oh, without a doubt.... But not about me. No, I...I kinda made all that stuff up. It just seems like you and I only really click when something crazy is going on.	So, do you think Elliot's somewhere right now, crying her eyes out?
I dunno, I guess I realized I don't really want to be in a relationship like that.	Mm.
No, Jamie, no! It's not an ultimatum, it's just something to think about.Oh, shoot, I gotta go!	Is that an ultimatum?
Hey! Sorry I'm late!	Yeah....
Sometimes it takes a priest to keep you from making a big mistake.	Since the day I met you!
I think relationships can be defined by big moments that don't happen. ...Or by the little ones that do.	What, now?
But once you get past the drama, it's actually pretty simple.All we have to do is whatever it takes to make her happy.	Ahhh. That's the stuff!
Even though Dr. Cox still didn't know he was the father of Jordan's baby, they were getting along better than ever.	Come on, Ted!
As for us, it's the end of our second year, and somehow each day had begun to feel the same.You see, after a while, your residency boils down to just a few things...Paperwork...The three prescriptions every patient gets...	I love you.
Paperwork...Mind-numbing monotony...And, of course, paperwork.As for the patients...	Give Miss Allan Acetaminophen for her headache, Restoril so she'll sleep, and Colace so she'll poop.
Uh, look, Mr. Graff, because it's diabetes-related, the pain in your foot isn't responding to pain-killers. But, I'd like to try an anti-seizure medication before we even consider amputation.	Paperwork...Mind-numbing monotony...And, of course, paperwork.As for the patients...
I guess that's why I'm so psyched our college buddy, Spence, is coming to town.	Oh, good. 'Cause I have an audition for "Stomp!" tomorrow. Look, just cut the damn thing off, will ya?
No.	Yes.
You know, guys, I don't think it's really appropriate for us to be rehashing our college sexual conquests with Carla in the other room	Yes.
YES! On a pile of coats with hundreds of people around! What a whore!	Leslie Stevens!
Carla...college wasn't all sex and coats. Spence, here, got me through a lot of hard times.	Who else! Who else did you bang??
Yes!My life changed that day.	Why don't you just mousse the crap out of it straight up!
No.	Mmm...
That's good good sauce.	Aw.
What I've got you on is D5 half normal saline with 20 KCL at a hundred CCs an hour.	Check it out free pitcher.
Spence, this is Dr. Cox and	Good morning, angels. What'd you have, one too many daiquiris last night?
No, no, no, _she_ just had a baby.	You just had a baby!
Holy crap! Run away! Run away! Run away! Run away! Run aw	That's exactly right!
Oook!	Holy crap! Run away! Run away! Run away! Run away! Run aw
See ya.	Newbie, if the next two words out of your mouth aren't "see ya", then the third word will be "Oh, my God, my crotch, you've punched me in the crotch."
Yeah.	How about that guy?
Yeah. You know what? Maybe it would just be easier if I told you whose butt I _haven't_ had my fingers in?	That guy?
Dream job....	Now that's one of the perks you never hear about. So, you guys pretty much landed your dream jobs, huh?
Mm-mm-mm.	Hey, man? How am I supposed to finish this memo?
Wronk.	Hey, Sweetness.
Oh, dammit!	Kinda never. Bambi. Rounds!
This is not a good day to be late.	I felt it!
Every year at this time, Kelso picks a resident to ride mercilessly until they crumble. The key is to jump on any easy question and impress him early.	This is not a good day to be late.
Yes!	All right. Shall we get started?
"Should we get started?" Answer: yes.	Excuse me?
This is it. Last man standing.	Dr., uh, uh...Young Asian Fellow, bed seven needs a central line.And Dr. Murphy and Dr. Eager Beaver, step forward.
E-eschemia.	What are the four differential diagnoses of the persistent ST elevation on any EKG? Dorian!
Pericarditis.	Dorian!
Aw, Doug.... At least you're going to a more chocolatey place.	Pass!
Uh, what?	I make more than you do!
You couldn't have seen my paycheck.	I saw your paycheck, and I've been dying to tell you I make more than you do. Quite a bit more.
That's my social security number!	Right. 'Cause there's no way I could access the personnel files. Just impossible!By the way, uh: 987-65-4320
No, my PIN number is 3674.	No...that's your PIN number.
Do you have any idea what it feels like to have a janitor make more money than you?	Bingo!
Oh! Ferrets are nice!	I dunno, a wallet? A money-clip? Hey! You could get Shmitty and Dan a wedding gift. Dan wants a ferret.
We gotta kinda lay low tonight, 'cause we're on back-up call.	Guys! Whatta you say we go do something special tonight, huh? My treat!
It's too hot on my eyes!	No!
What do you do when you have to pee?	Hell, some days I just sit out here for hours on end, downing cold one after cold one.
Nah, it's just a stupid intern.	You guys have to go to work?
Plus, the two guys who are on call would have to be, like, simultaneously incapacitated.	In breaking news, there's been a multiple-car pile-up on the throughway.
Part of being a doctor is learning to deal with the unexpected. Whether it's someone who won't take "no" for an answer...	Wassup, chica!Ohh, ohhh! God!
...Or being shaken to your very core.	Yeah, I've decided not to accept the whole being dumped thing. I'm just gonna hang around until you forgive me.
Of course, sometimes it's just having to work in wet grundies.	Gaaagh!
Uh, we...we, uh, we had a few.	Hey, Betty. Hey, Wilma. Oh, what the hell, you're only forty minutes late. Do I...do I smell beer?
Look, Dr. Cox....	Newsflash: you can't drink and then come to work you're not airline pilots!
You know what? At least what I do matters! Okay? You're cleaning the same spot you were this morning, and the smart money says you'll be cleaning it again tomorrow. So why don't I just come by then, and you can tell me how what you do day after day makes even the slightest bit of difference in this world.	Hey, Foodstamps!Little anonymous donation from a guy who makes a little more scratch than you.
I don't care if I hurt his feelings, 'cause I got absolutely crushed tonight. Luckily, Turk and I both knew who was responsible for all this.	Too mean!
Typical Spence. You just blow into town and get us in a bunch of trouble.	What are you talking about? I'm the one who introduced Shmitty and Dan! ...Okay.... I didn't really introduce them, but I'm the one who accidentally saw them under the foosball table. Aw, Shmitty....
You wanna go	What, I _made_ you guys go out tonight? Hey, I have a venture capital presentation Thursday. Ask me if I want to go out drinking Wednesday night.
Would I what?	Would you?
As I bent down to eat that peppered floor turkey, unaware that the cleanser the Janitor uses is an extremely potent diuretic, I realized something.	Would you eat off the floor?
Aaaaah.	As I bent down to eat that peppered floor turkey, unaware that the cleanser the Janitor uses is an extremely potent diuretic, I realized something.
...The reason we're doctors is because we have an innate desire to help people.	Aaaaah.
And you have to have that desire, because at the end of your second year it's impossible to see the light at the end of the tunnel.So it becomes about perseverance......and fortitude......and sacrifice.	That was disgusting.
Yeah, well, give the guys a big kiss for us.	Well, I'm sorry you guys can't make the wedding.
Later.	I'm gonna miss you guys.... I'll see you later.
Really, all you can hope for is just an occasional thank-you.	Later, dude.
I'm so glad the medication worked on your foot.	Really, all you can hope for is just an occasional thank-you.
You're welcome.	So I'm supposed to be happy because someone finally did something right?
Ohhh! How cool was that!	Nice call on the anti-seizure medication, there, Newbie. You know I'm actually starting to think you may not be the worst resident that ever lived.
You shut up. You're an angry man!I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the whole "it's your baby" thing.We'll probably talk about that later.	Shut up.
No?	You know I'm I wasn't even mad at Jordan.
You? Come on! You're gonna be a very scary fath I mean a great...you're gonna be a great father. Like last night, when you totally kicked our asses 'cause we deserved it? And do you remember that time you told me I wasn't the worst resident that ever lived?	No, I was scared. In fact, I was freaking out all day, because I'm quite confident that I'm gonna be an absolutely horrible father.
You have no idea how much that meant to me.	You mean like eight seconds ago?
But, Dr. Cox, you're always there when we need you! I think you have this fathering thing down!	I said I _think_ you may not be the worst resident ever, but I can't be sure of stuff like that. Come on, I haven't done the appropriate leg work!
That may come up tomorrow....	Girl! He hit him right in the nose! Uh-huh! Yeah!
Not allowed unless you're gay.	Dude, what's the rule about white boys dancing in public?
Morning, Steven.	Not allowed unless you're gay.
Fine. Then I'll just put on something that rocks!	Morning, Steven.
As a third-year resident, you know everyone so well you can practically speak for them. For instance....	Fine. Then I'll just put on something that rocks!
Remember: No more dancing.Pow!Good morning, Bambi. Sign this, please?Who you eyeballing, tough guy?	As a third-year resident, you know everyone so well you can practically speak for them. For instance....
And of course....	Remember: No more dancing.Pow!Good morning, Bambi. Sign this, please?Who you eyeballing, tough guy?
Well, Zsa Zsa. Now you've put me in quite the pickle. You see, with those earphones on, you can't hear me; but! the odds are highly against you cracking open that yapper and annoying me today. So, what to do? What to do? What to do? Ahh, hell	And of course....
See, things never really change around here....Surgical and Medical still play each other in basketball.	Stop addressing me as "Dr. Cox" in front of your patients. When they find out my actual name, they tend to page me with questions when they realize just exactly how inept you really are. Oh, and as an added safety measure, from now on, I'll only be responding to "Doc," "Doctor," "Ceasar," or "The Big Cheese;" and noooo, I'm _not_ joking. Not _now_ not ever.
Yeah? Well I heard that your sister started drinking again!	I'm gonna toast you so bad, your momma ain't even gonna recognize you!
I'm still not great at smack-talk.	Yeah? Well I heard that your sister started drinking again!
So, it's not supposed to be true?	I'm still not great at smack-talk.
And Elliot was still searching for something to turn things around for her.	No. Ohhh, let it pour, big guy.
But really, the only difference is that by the third year, nothing catches you by surprise.	Frick!
Oh, good Lord, I have no idea. Okay, don't panic, just do what all doctors do in this situation and fake a page.	So, what's wrong with me, doctor?
Uh-oh. Got a Code 3 down the hall.	Oh, good Lord, I have no idea. Okay, don't panic, just do what all doctors do in this situation and fake a page.
Uhhh, Code 3? Not as bad as a Code 4, but a hell of a lot worse than a Code 2.	What's that?
You're a surgeon you just cut people up, you don't actually know anything.	Why won't you ask me?
Dr. Cox! Dr. Cox.Big Cheese.	Oh, yeah.
If you're wondering why Dr. Kelso's nose is squeaking......about a week ago, he was torturing Elliot......and Dr. Cox, well....Needless to say, there were consequences.	Yes?
So, Dr. Cox, can you, uh, look at her chart?	Uh, so what happened, sir?
No.	No.
Your voice gets really high when you're upset.	You could be a baby sometimes.
I'll have a Razz-ma-Tazz?	Peach Fizzle-Vizzle?
Mrs. Farr. You know what? The only way I'm gonna figure out what's wrong with this woman is start running tests for everything.	Got it.
In a hospital, you can never try to get anything done Friday after 5 P.M. Because anyone who can actually help you is out of here like a gunshot.	Good luck, Bambi. Look at the time.
Hello? Anyone?Have a good weekend, Steven.	In a hospital, you can never try to get anything done Friday after 5 P.M. Because anyone who can actually help you is out of here like a gunshot.
No, the cook died.	Why, am I going home tonight?
What the hell am I gonna do?	No, the cook died.
Okay, if we're ever gonna figure out what's wrong with that lady, we need to get a whole bunch of tests done.	How can we help, Bambi?
There's nothing wrong with needing your friends to take care of someone.... It's better than missing out on your family because you're stuck making new friends....	Okay, if we're ever gonna figure out what's wrong with that lady, we need to get a whole bunch of tests done.
Still, even that's not the worst....	No, no you you certainly may not!Bad man.
'Kay, I'll get the x-ray, you two go work on the echo-cardiogram, and then all three of us will meet back here and deal with the abdominal CAT-scan, okay?	Still, even that's not the worst....
We got it, Elliot.	Well, what can I do?
Being such a mess that your friends don't even ask for your help? That's the bottom of the barrel.	We got it, Elliot.
Damn!	Uh-uh-uh! Don't want to know who they are! Don't want to know how they're doing! Just wanna go "click-click!" and get 'em out of here! Now, your lady's about forty people down on the list. And as always, uh, there are no cutsies.
It's so cool, Laddy, let's never talk to anyone about it, ever!	See, because of the way I laid on top of you, I can tell people this is an x-ray of Siamese twins! How cool is that!
Dr. Cox, I managed to get some tests done on Mrs. Farr....	I may have painted his toenails for funsies.
Sorry.	Look, Gwyneth, you're old enough now to hear this from me: Every time I go out of my way to help you children, I get nothing but trouble. Now this is the first five-minute window I've had in the last week to be with my son. And I'm just not gonna have you pirouetting around in here while my heart is breaking inside.
Well, we're all under one roof here, we gotta watch out for each other, right? Come on!	Thank you.
Whoooa! Agh!	There he is.
Ow.	Watch out.
Unfortunately, that's when we ran into a brick wall.	Ow.
Look, Dr. Moyer	I'm head of the radiology department. You call me in from home to do an abdominal CAT-scan that could wait until Monday morning? Well, guess what? It's not happening.
How is that helpful?	MY MACHINES!
Wow.	Hell, zhyeah!
It feels good to work as a team and gather all the pieces of the puzzle together so we can finally look Mrs. Farr in the face and tell her...we still don't know what the hell she has.	Wow.
Dammit, why can't we figure out what's wrong with this lady?	It feels good to work as a team and gather all the pieces of the puzzle together so we can finally look Mrs. Farr in the face and tell her...we still don't know what the hell she has.
Familial Mediterranean fever.	Aw, come on, you guys, gimme a break you know this.
I'm actually grateful most things don't change.	Atta boy.
Not only is the status quo good for work, it's also somewhat comforting.	My paddle's stuck in me!
And if something does change, more often than not it just reminds you of feelings you've had all along.	Now, I would've never figured it out unless you guys had done the leg work. You four deserve all the credit, really.Mrs. Farr, Dr. Cox has saved the day! Don't ya just love it? Come here!
You look beautiful.	And if something does change, more often than not it just reminds you of feelings you've had all along.
Like I said, once you hit the third year, there aren't a lot of surprises.	You look beautiful.
Damn.	Hey! What are you doing here?
I'm never happy when a guy comes back into Elliot's life. But at least with Sean...it's entertaining.	Look who's here.
One, two, three...	No, way! Mine is April 25th! 2006! Oh, the place I love in Connecticut books up early so what the hell, took a shot.
Marcia, please!No, I have not!	My name is Maureen McCormick.
I don't _love_ Journey.	Bambi, not everyone loves Journey as much as you.
"...Livin' in a lonely world! She took a midnight train goin' aaaanywheeeere!" Fine, I love 'em. If you wanna book the band, they're called The Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin's and they rock! Book 'em now, thank me later.	"She's just a small town girl..."
After that, the day got worse.	"...Livin' in a lonely world! She took a midnight train goin' aaaanywheeeere!" Fine, I love 'em. If you wanna book the band, they're called The Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin's and they rock! Book 'em now, thank me later.
Probably cleans up the seal poop!	I've never been to Sea World. What exactly does Sean do here, anyway?
Lame!	There he is!
I can't believe you and Carla set a date.	Sweetheart, I think you're confusing interesting with boring.
Anyway, about this whole setting the date thing: I mean, I'm really psyched for you guys, it's just gonna be harder and harder for us to hang out, you know? I mean, you're gonna be married, man! You're gonna have, like, a house! You know? You're gonna be spending your weekends chasing around little Arturo and Rosaria!	Wedding talk! Ohh, how lovely!
You should...talk to Carla....	You mean Tamika and Fuquan?
Turk, why are you so afraid of loving me?	Sounds like you're asking me out on a man-date.
I mean, this is like the end of an era! Okay? We've always been known as Turk-&-J.D. Like, when we were in college, people'd be like, "When are Turk-&-J.D. getting here?" Right? And then in med school, everyone was like, "When _are_ Turk-&-J.D. getting here?"	Well, I, uhh....
The point is, we were together so much, this one Indian girl only slept with him 'cause she thought his last name was "Anjadi".	We didn't have a car.
See! This is the kind of stuff I'm gonna miss! The...the reminiscing...the way your breath always smelled of curry....	It was a very good day for me!
I had a tattoo once.	Right. Listen, when you slice me up, make sure you don't mess up my tatt. my fiancé, Tracy, would kill me.
I was a cougar! Arrgh-arrgh-aaarrgh! See ya later.	Dude, you got your face painted at the hospital picnic.
I.P.	First name?
In a hospital, every day is made up of little battles.	No, ma'am.
Sometimes you fight them not because you want to, but because you have to....	Can I have everyone's attention please? I officially don't care anymore who peed in this jar!
Other times you fight for what you want...	Shut up.
...but what you want isn't willing to wait.	Sean, I can't make it to dinner.
If you're lucky, there's no battle at all everything works out perfectly.	Sure, Elliot...yeah....
Yo, there he is! For a second I thought you weren't coming, dude.	If you're lucky, there's no battle at all everything works out perfectly.
Yeah, I'm so psyched we're doing this, man.	Hey! Turk-&-J.D.! And J.D.!
You invited The Todd?	'Scuse me for a second, fellas. I'm gonna go over there and tell that girl my name's "Beer," then I'm gonna offer her some "beer nuts"! What's up!Mental five.
But I thought we were gonna, like, reminisce tonight, you know? Get a little deep?	Dude, we left at the same time. I didn't know what to say to him.
I'm outta here.	Oh, that was the hottest slap I've ever gotten! I can't believe I wasn't gonna come out tonight! Thanks for twisting my arm.
Oh, nothing I just found out my favorite chips cause anal leakage and, oh, I'm not talking to you.	Whassup?
I don't get it, man. All I wanted to do was take you to dinner, and you made me feel like a total idiot.	How did you get him to stop talking to you?
You never tell me how you feel!	Why you making a big deal about this?
I'm not talking to you!	Aw, dammit all! I never tell you how _I_ feel.
I don't understand. Ever since I met you it's been like this one-way street. I mean, I-I-I-I tell you everything, and you tell me nothing. I don't get it what are you afraid of?	Finally! Thank you.
I'm always happy when someone wins a battle. Because around here, you get your fair share of disappointment.I guess in the end you have to fight for things that really matter. Like pride in your work......or your friendship.	I gotta go.
Well you're gonna be very pleased with the next twenty-three songs.	You know, I'm actually starting to like Journey.
You know, the fact that you're even here for an end-of-an-era celebration is enough we don't have to, like, get all deep or anything.	Heh.
Uh-huh?	No, I wanna try this, man. Okay, Um.... Ever since Carla and I set the date for the wedding, I started thinking. You know those lame-ass couples that get engaged but they never actually get married they just cruise along, year after year, without making any real kind of commitment?
Hey, Puki, can we get two appletinis, please?	Dude, I wanted to be one of those couples, man!
And sometimes, all you can do is grit your teeth and tell the truth.	Hey, Puki, can we get two appletinis, please?
Dr. Cox and Jordan are still looking for a pediatrician....	Here you go.I'm gonna be hearing about this all day.
Like I said: Same ol', same ol'.	Charmed.
You pulled the paper away!	Heh-hah-hah. You drew on the wall. You drew on the wall!
Dan, don't! That's dad's indelible space pen! And prom is in like two weeks!Good evening Mr. and Mrs. Shefford. I'm...here to pick up Amy for...prom.Yeah, that that'll come off you won't have to get laser surgery or skin from your ass or anything.	Stop lyin'. It's gonna come off, right?
Especially certain stupid relationships with stupid Sea World trainers who stole my stupid girl!	In a hospital, lots of things last longer than you wish they would....
Stupid whales.Hey, Sean! Right on, brother!	Well, I've, uh, I've got whales to train.
As third-year residents, you really have to stay on top of your interns.	Where the hell are my interns!?
This guy needs courage.	These! Right here! You see these names!? They are called patients! This one needs brain work! This one needs a heart!
The girl one just called you "Dr. Jerk"!	Dr. Jerk!
...What?	No sweat. You should hear what they call Dr. Michead.
I decided to take a different tack with my interns.	...What?
Look, guys, I'm not here to overwork ya, okay? I'm not I'm not just your resident I'm your buddy, I'm your go-to guy.... I'm J.D.	I decided to take a different tack with my interns.
Of course, my tack had its own drawbacks.	Look, guys, I'm not here to overwork ya, okay? I'm not I'm not just your resident I'm your buddy, I'm your go-to guy.... I'm J.D.
But it is crucial I have everyone here at 9 a.m. sharp tomorrow, okay?	Of course, my tack had its own drawbacks.
Absolutely. Anyone else need to be late?	Oh, uh...is it cool if I come at 9:30?
Okay, well, why don't we why don't we just make it 10, then? Okay?	Bad for me.
But I said 10!	I can be here at 9.
I guess everyone has their own style.	But I said 10!
Okay. Good talk!	Oh, no problem, Bambi. Oh! But the reason my nurses had to do that is because none of your interns know how. So if you keep flapping your mouth without knowing all the facts, I'm gonna see if I can fit my foot in it!
Jimmy, didn't you do one yesterday?	You did it for me both times.
Do not miss that! It's awesome! Seth?	No, you let me go home 'cause I forgot to set my TiVo for the Styx 'Behind the Music'?
That was when I realized what I'd turned my interns into.	Do not miss that! It's awesome! Seth?
Even though my interns sucked, I decided to turn it into a positive.	Eh, can't blame the cleanser.
Elliot, uh, I need some pointers on how to deal with my interns.	Even though my interns sucked, I decided to turn it into a positive.
Anyway, do you think we could, like, meet up after work or something?	....aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagggggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh-hagh-haaaaaaaaaaaaggggggggghhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!....
Nothin' major.	No! Don't do it!
Wow...you look great.	Hey!
Hey, Sean's here, everybody.... Hey, Sean! Heeeyyy!	Oh, hey, J.D.
Okay, stay calm at least she's here, too.	You know, since he's a trainer, Sean is really good with behavior and communication. I mean, he helped me so much with my interns that I thought maybe he could help you with yours.
And just like that, I had another rough night ahead of me.At least I wasn't the only one.	Mm-hmm.Bye.This'll be fun!
Yep, it's gonna be a long, long night.	Don't mind if I do!
I'll try, Sean!	Kick him in the crotch and run.
O...kay. I have a lot of things to do...but....	Cool. Try to have it back by 5.
Kick him in the crotch, dammit! The crotch!	Hey, J.D.? Can I offer a little constructive criticism?
Okay, that's it. I-I-I'm sorry, Sean, I'm a doctor, okay? I-I'm teaching humans, not dolphins, okay? So it isn't really helpful for me to know what works on fish.	You know, I had the same problem when I started working with the dolphins
Oh, well, Sean! Unfortunately for me, my interns aren't mammals!	They're mammals, actually.
S-sh I don't care, Sean!Come on, Turk!	J.D., they are.
Can you believe that crap Sean was saying?	Hm!
Me!	Hey, who wants to help me move?
Love to!	J.D., could you walk my dog tonight while I have casual sex with your friend, Miguel?
I know where it all goes...!	Hey. Who wants to help me move back?
I'd like to think so.	Think about it, man. Cox has taught you the most since you've been here, right? Do you really think he gives a damn whether you like him or not?
Catch him and kick him in his junk!	I felt the love.
Hey, Sean, you were right about me and my interns. I guess I owe you an apology.	Tell your friends, baby!
Sorry.	J.D., it's no big deal. We both know that it wasn't about that. Well, you...you like Elliot.
You're not pissed off? I'd be pissed off. Why aren't you pissed off?	Don't sweat it.
Ohh.... Cool.	I dunno. I guess I just...I don't see you as that much of a threat.
I don't care. All that matters is finding a way to sleep at night....painting over your black spot......or imagining Shamu taking Sean's arm off.You don't need a doctor to tell you that a good night's sleep can fix almost anything.	Ohh.... Cool.
I've learned to make Dr. Cox's rants work for me.I catch up on paperwork; I look after patients...	You're right, Newbie, we have been working together for a while. Of course, I wouldn't know the exact number of days unless I consulted my Friends For Life calendar that I keep taped inside my hope chest. Still....
Carla, can you check room air pulse ox on Mrs. Shipp?	I've learned to make Dr. Cox's rants work for me.I catch up on paperwork; I look after patients...
...I take care of those official things that just have to get done.	You got it, Bambi.
_You're_ a jerk!	You're a jerk.
Crystal!	...Long story short, there, Molly, I will always whistle at you like you're a blonde with big bombs and I'm a construction worker just released from prison. That clear?
Uh, listen, while I have you here I'm applying for a fellowship, and I could really use a letter of recommendation. I was thinking that, when you wrote it, instead of using a girl's name you could refer to me as "Dr. Dorian." I think it sounds a little more professional and, frankly, each time you call me a girl's name, I die a little inside.	Super!
I should get that tattooed on my neck.	Look, Janice, Denise, Tiffany Amber Thiiiieeeessen! Lemme go ahead and share a little something special with you that I like to call Perry's Perspective. One: If someone's standing in front of me in line at the coffee shop and they can't decide what they want in the half an hour it took to get to the register, I should be allowed to kill them. Two: I'm fairly sure if they took porn off the internet, there'd only be one website left, and it'd be called "Bring back the porn!" Three and most importantly of all: The only way to be respected as a doctor nay, respected as a man is to be an island; you are born alone, you damn sure die alone. Isn't that right, spike?The point is, and you just might want to jot this down: only the weak need help.
Dr. Jeffrey Steadman world-class suck-up. Especially since the residency director position opened up.	Hey! Your Chief of Medicine just said good afternoon, people!
Well, I'm off to fluid rounds.To fluid rounds!	If only, sir.
What the hell, that's not funny! All he did was this	All right.
It's never fun being the fifth wheel, especially when one of those wheels is Elliot's boyfriend. Still, I had decided to take the high road.	Hey, you're not doing it right.
That is diet....	Hey, J.D., is this regular? I asked you to bring me a diet.
Enjoy.	It's all the regular soda, Sean!
Muahahahahahahaha!	Enjoy.
Fascinating stuff, Sean.	Ohh.
Hello, boys.	Oh, hey I used to date that girl.
Goodbye, boys....	You, too, Mary...Angel...izabeth...?
Oh, no! I've got to stop this! Kick him!	Do what?
Two coins add up to thirty cents and one of them is not a nickel.	Troy! We're listening.
It's a _riddle_. You figure it out.	So what are they?
Good evening, Elliot! This is your great aunt Sally. Are you there?	Okay, yes! J.D. and I work together! But it's not like we're crazy close! I mean, it's not like we have all these inside jokes! And we definitely don't do this....
I guess you're at Sean's. Hey, good thing we're so crazy close, or I wouldn't know how to impersonate your aunt Sally! By the way, I ran into Eye Patch this morning said to tell you, "Honka! Honka!"	Nuh-uh.
Will you write my recommendation?	Fair enough. I'm gonna go ahead and write you a prescription for two testicles; and you feel free to get this filled out whenever you wantbut right now, I'm goin' after that residency director gig, and you're joining me for a really stupid board member meet-and-greet.
Goodbye.	Oh, hell no!
Okay, fine. Lemme just fix my hair. Oh, wait!I don't have to!	Oh, gimme a break! I'll write whatever you want! Just...we gotta go.
It was amazing to see how much Dr. Cox actually wanted this job. And how much he was willing to put up with to get it!	Love yours!
I guess it was just amazing to see how much he cared.	Gee, you're too much. What's the thread count on those bad boys?
Relationships can be tricky. Especially the ones that have barely begun.	Yeah.
Good what?	So I guess, uh...I guess this is goodbye.
Beeeee! BEEEEE! BEEEEEEEEE! AAAAAAAAGGGGGGHHHHHH!	I know. It's just hard for me.
You know what? Okay? This never would have happened if my Hairmet hadn't gotten stolen at your stupid suck-up fest last night!Now, I took the liberty of writing the recommendation you promised me.All you have to do is sign right below where it says, "He makes me proud to be a doctor," and right above where it says, "P.S. He ain't too hard on the eyes, either!"	Oh, it's just that it looks so painful and possibly infected that I must flick it!
You can't make me feel guilty for asking for help. That's just the way the world works, okay? A-and you know what? Most people actually like helping out the people around them.Take Carla, for instance! Don't you think she'd do anything in the world to help out Turk, no matter what the situation?	Tell you what, Newbie: This must be a very...very proud day for ya.
Still, I don't even believe that you think asking for help makes you look weak; I think you don't do it because you're afraid of putting yourself out there. And that's why you're never gonna get anywhere.Thank you for this!	Look! He didn't apologize! So just back the hell off, okay!He messes up and I'm the one who gets...
...how I feel. I mean, life's too short not to go for it with Elliot. Plus, now Sean's out of the picture? Stop being such a chicken!	What's wrong with me? Here I am trying not to let fear ruin my life anymore, and then Sean moves away and I don't even have the guts to tell him how I feel.
Nope, nope, nope. The correct answer is: A quarter and a nickel.	"-brary," Troy. "Li-BRAR-y." Anyway, "What two coins, when you put 'em together, makes thirty cents and one of them isn't a nickel?" Hmmmm. A _penny_ and...a 1972 dime with a Roosevelt imperfection, today worth exactly twenty-nine cents.
Right. The _other one_ is.	Uh, no. Because you said one of 'em _isn't_ a nickel.
No. It's a riddle.	You lied to me.
Pride's a funny thing....	Ooh! Your face is red! Like a strawbrerry!
A lot of times, pride can be pretty hard to swallow.	Howdy, fellas. Don't ya don't ya dare get up I don't want to see any broken hips.
But still, in a good relationship, pride never gets in the way.	Oh, golly, God!
As for me, even if I wanted to put my pride on the line and go tell Elliot how I feel, I can't I have to work tonight.	Scalpel _what_?
I still don't think I should go see her.	Say, Newbie, seeing as you are partially responsible for me being the new residency director, I'm gonna go ahead and give you the rest of the night off. I I I I don't know, it's just kind of my own personal way of saying...I can't actually stand the sight of you. Ha!
What the hell...?	Here, buddy. Baby wasn't mine.
Elliot, there's something I have to tell you.	Oh, J.D.!
Ohh, these? Uhh, I thought Elliot would be sad with you guys splitting up, so I just wanted to....	Oh, those are nice!
Okay.... I'm not sure they....	Yeah.
Not sure they can...reach the water, but....	Yeah....
...Of course, it's harder if your patient suffers from dementia and can only say one word....	Pickles!
And to drink?	...Of course, it's harder if your patient suffers from dementia and can only say one word....
And now, for a thousand dollars and this bag of I.V. fluid, which is guaranteed to make you feel like you're a hundred and ninety again, What did Peter Piper pick a peck of?	Pickles!
Oooooooh! I'm sorry, Mr. Bober! The correct answer is _peppers_. "Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled _peppers_."	Pickles.
Huh?	NEWBIE!
Yes....	Did I just walk in on you mocking an innocent patient!?
Eh, no biggie. 'Cause here comes my dream girl with a smile just for me.	Oh, I could just give you a hug! Of course, I never would! I could, but I never would, God save me! I never would...
What?	J.D.... You know what I love?
And that's when I made one of the biggest mistakes I've made in some time....	My boyfriend Sean.
I'm really bummed out about Elliot. I just needed someone to talk to.	And that's when I made one of the biggest mistakes I've made in some time....
I called my brother.	I'm really bummed out about Elliot. I just needed someone to talk to.
And with that, I had reopened the door that I had successfully closed years ago.	Yeah, boo-frickin'-hoo. Listen, I'm so glad you called. You know how Mom's getting remarried again for the seventh time? Well, this is turning into such a hassle for me....
Yes, Dan, I got your eleven messages. Now, because you're my brother, I'm gonna put this nicely: Leave me alone.	And with that, I had reopened the door that I had successfully closed years ago.
Yes, it's killing me. So much so that I have to go, okay?	This whole Mom thing doesn't bother you?
Wait! Dan! Hoog!	All right, buddy. I'll see you soon.Real soon.
Turk, don't.	Christopher! Looks like we have the makings of a dog-pile here.
Oh, the audacity.	Ugh, yeah!To a loser! Total loser. This guy's making me move out of Mom's attic.
Amy.	I know. But you know what? This is gonna be great. You know, this reminds me of the time I came down to see you guys when you were in med school.... Oh! And I hooked up with that slutty chick! Remember, the one with the huge cans? What was her name?
She was my girlfriend.	Yeah! How do you remember stuff like that?
No.	Right.
Haunting.	Hey! Hey! Check this out! Turk and I have been working on our harmonizing.A-one, a-two, a-one, two three:
I love the theatre....	You've always had the talent, little brother. You get in on this, and we could take this on the road!
Turk! Can you please not put your skivvies in the freezer!? I'm sick of my popsicles tasting like fabric softener!	Ah! Come to papa!
This is a stimulating conversation. I can't imagine why Mom's new husband doesn't want you in the house.	Ahhhhhh!
They did?	Me neither! And you know what, J.D.? I'm worried, 'cause I think this marriage might actually stick.
Oh, that's great! I I guess you're only here because Mom wrecked the car?	Oh, yeah, yeah. Matter of fact, the only reason you were born is 'cause Mom bounced a check at the market.
Dan wanted to come with me to work today, but I told him it would make me a little uncomfortable. He was okay with it.	Mammogram-mobile. Well, not officially I just got the offer today but I'd make more money than I do now, riding around in an ambulance, and even though I'll be handling breasts all day, my beautiful fiancee, who is very secure with the will let meI ride around in an ambulance.
Nah, usually I'm in there by myself.	Now, I heard there's a bed in the on-call room. You ever get, uh, hot & heavy in there?
Oh, thank God.Dr. Cox! You remember my brother Dan?	So, yes.
This is my boss, Dan.	That's a first.
Uh, Dan, why don't you go get a snack cake?	Oh, my ribs!
Uh, Dr. Cox, Dan was wondering if he could trail with us today....	Snack cake.
Look, Dr. Cox...	Good God in heaven, Newbie, there are just so very many ways for me to say this to you: Never; not in a million years; absolutely not; no way, Jose; no chance, Lance; niet; negatory; mm-mm; nuh-uh; oh-oh; and of course my own personal favorite of all time, man falling off of a cliff "Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!..."
I just want to say, thank you.	..."Pff."
"Nooooooooo..." Heh. "Poof." Heh.	Hold the phone. You don't want him to come with us?
A gomer's an old person that takes up room in the hospital and doesn't have the common decency to die.	What's a gomer?
Well, I'm sorry, dude, I don't I don't have time for pickles right now. I got three vegetables and a drug addict who's gonna tell me this time things'll be different, then try to take my watch again.Dammit!	See, now that's just rude is what that is.
Feels like three. But, uh, say hi to Wayne, and good luck in the bumper pool tournament.	Two days.
Why!?	Yeah, actually, J.D., I don't think I'm leaving.
You know what, Dan, once Dad left and Mom started marrying everyone that rang the doorbell, I remember someone saying how lucky I was to have an older brother. But you never came through for me once, did you. I mean, I called you for help because I'm in love with a girl who's in love with someone else, and you responded by showing up here, drinking all my Bailey's Irish Cream, and whining about Mom's new boyfriend. You are a self-involved user, Dan. And you wanna tell _me_ what kind of person to be? I tell you what, instead, why don't you just get the hell out of my life?	Well, 'cause I'm worried about you. I mean, hanging with you today and watching you work, with the gomer talk and all the attitude now, I'm not so sure I like the guy you're turning into. It's definitely not my little brother.
Not to me.	But we're brothers. That counts for something, right?
Chocolate chippity good!	Ah! Ah!How are your chocolate chip flapjacks, little brother?
Turk, you don't get it, man. Your family was there for you.	Dude, how many time I gotta tell you? Cracker bad!
One-nothing.	You know, I love how kids of divorce really have the market cornered on family dysfunction. But let me share with you a typical Thanksgiving at the Turk household: It starts with my mother yelling at my sister for yelling at my grandmother who's yelling at the television screen, which happens to be the microwave. And then my militant brother Jabari formerly Bob gives my father attitude for using the word "black", even though he's referring to the turkey. Which, by the way, only got burnt because instead of turning the oven off, my bi-polar aunt Leslie tried to shove her head in it.Now check the ball, cracka!
Hey, Dan.	Waiting for my brother.
That way.So, you...taking off?	Well, isn't that perfect. You send your brother in to do the dirty work, huh? And with an open fly, no less!Made you look. A two-fer! Emergency Room?
Look, um, Dan...I wanna apologize for everything I said. For what it's worth, I really like having you around.	Yeah.
I know. I have dreams where I staple your fingers to your face.	No you don't.
Love can give you strength you never knew you had.	Hey, listen, Dr. Cox: No offense, I'm a big fan of the tough-guy act, but let me tell you what I really think. I think you love the fact that these kids idolize you. Johnny does! Johnny was always the one in the family we knew was going someplace sweet kid, smart kid. Becoming a doctor, this is all he ever wanted; and yet, somehow, you've found a way to beat that out of him, haven't you? Turned him into some cynical guy who seems to despise what he does.
Love can also give you courage.	Good to see you, Dan. All the best.
As for me, it's enough just to love my brother, even though I know he'll never come up big for me.	I think he's got something stuck behind his big, sharp tooth.
Here we go with this guy again.	Well, Mr. Pickles, welcome back.
No....	Yep. Still, it sure is nice to be doing something you love. I wouldn't trade it. How 'bout you?
What's up with you and her brother, anyway? Did something happen at her mother's funeral?	Deal.
The amazing thing wasn't that Carla's brother hated Turk...	Sorry for your loss....I mean, who wears a vest to a funeral, anyway, man?
...it was that he was able to keep it up without even speaking the same language.	¡Un abrazo a tu hermana!
Still, I had my own problems.Even though she had a boyfriend, I was still crazy about Elliot. And, God bless her, she wasn't making it any easier.	Dude, you were wearin' a vest! Vesto!
What are you doing?	Hey.
Bunk with The Todd!	All the beds are taken. Scoot.
Oh, hey Sean.	Hello? ... Sean!? Where are you? ... The west coast of New Zealand? I'm in the on-call room! ... Hey, J.D.'s here!J.D., say hi!
Oh! You wanted to keep talking?	Uh!?
How are you supposed to get over someone when you have to be around them all the time?This night could not get any worse.	Oh! You wanted to keep talking?
Todd! You're having a dream! Wake up!	How are you supposed to get over someone when you have to be around them all the time?This night could not get any worse.
Oh, I think he means _me_, Angela.	It's all about the four dollars, trust me. And seeing as my money is contingent on you lemmings actually doing your jobs, I would say that now is a pretty good time for you to scurry on back to work so that I can continue to afford the antidepressants that keep me so damn jolly. GO!!!Say, Angela....
I wonder what I did now.	Oh, I think he means _me_, Angela.
No problem.	Lookit, this new gig is a great opportunity for me, and I I want it to go well. And, for some reason, all these other bobble-heads seem to look up to you, so it would make my life one hell of a lot easier if you got in line behind me.
I guess people can surprise you.	No problem.
We'd still what?	We'd still die.
Me too.	If the elevator cable snapped, even if we timed it out perfectly and jumped up right before impact, we'd still be crushed to death. I wish I'd taken the stairs.
Inner monologue? Weirdo!	Sorry, sometimes I just have this inner monologue running through my head.
That's my floor.	Inner monologue? Weirdo!
Something's come to his attention.	It's come to my attention...
Unfortunately, our new residency director felt a little differently.	Why don't I do that for you? You're a bad doctor.
I say we listen to Dr. Cox, and do exactly what he says.	...Just go ahead and get a steady BG.
You heard him, people! We're moving on!	Here that's a shame, because the whole dolphin thing used to make you so interesting. Too bad.
...God help him!	Oh, God help me.
Ohhhh, I wish she'd cut it off and give it to me.	Mm. I gotta go my chin hair is back.
Oh, GOD!	Ohhhh, I wish she'd cut it off and give it to me.
Are you stalking me?	I don't mind it at the movies, sitting alone. But eating alone is sad and pathetic.
So, is there any chance of you guys getting back together?	Nooo. My sister just had a baby, so I'm doing the whole aunt thing.
Yeah, it does. You know what we need to do? Uhh...?	Well, he's engaged, and he's getting married in two weeks...but, yeah, I think so.Unrequited love sucks, you know.
J.D.	Danni.
Hi. Danni, we need to move on, okay? No more thinking about our exes; no more waiting for the phone to ring; no more stealing her purse just so you can return it later in the hopes that she'll be so grateful, she'll use the money recovered to buy you a drink and _maybe_ have sex with you after.	Hi!
I stole the wrong purse. ...And, yes!	Did that work?
Grandma Dorian or Nana Hobbs? Because Nana Hobbs can be an eensy bit racist.	I know you all think of me as some heartless monster; still, if your grandmother were here, wouldn't you want her doctor to spend as much time with her as he does with anyone else?
She's dead.	Grandma Dorian.
Sir, I don't think that's true.	The point is, sometimes what's best for this hospital _is_ what's best for the patients! I know it, you know it, and guess what, Dr. Cox knows it, too. Although damned if he doesn't disagree with me just because I said it.
What are you doing?	Your witness.
And...?	Good. So, I did it I talked to my ex.
See! That's what happens when you finally have the courage to cut the cord! Before you know it, you'll be ready for someone new to come along.	And I said, "Congratulations on the wedding, and I hope you two stay happy, and, by the way, size does matter."
Ooh, I can't. I got something really important to do.	Hey, you wanna go grab a cup of coffee?
It'll turn up....	Thanks, J.D. I am so tense. Someone stole my purse!
Once the dynamic of a relationship is established, it rarely changes.	It'll turn up....
Of course, if the dynamic does change, it's never as simple as you'd hope.	Don't get me started.
...Especially when it involves someone who's used to you following their lead.	Hey, Newbie, listen, I got dinner plans with Jordan, and seeing as you're on-call, whatta you say you pull up a chair, here, in front of Miss Bartow?
Look, Dr. Cox, I'll take care of her, and I'll have my interns help, but you gotta know I have other patients, too, so....	...Especially when it involves someone who's used to you following their lead.
I don't think so.	Maybe you didn't understand me, there, Violet. I don't want you leaving her side, even if someone thinks they saw Justin Timberlake downstairs. Now, dammit all, are you falling in line with me or not?
Don't worry, guys. I'd never let her hurt you.	Oh, God, if Jordan knew I was the reason Dr. Cox canceled dinner tonight, she'd give me the stink-eye and then twist my nurples off.Calm down, tiger. She doesn't know.She knows! She knows!
I don't know.... I might.... Why?	Filed alphabetically in my "Elliot Cabinet".
Yeah.	Well, you know the picture of us at the beach, where I actually look good and you think that you look like Bjork?
No problem!	Well, I was hoping you wouldn't mind if I cut you out of it, and used it in a collage that I'm making for Sean?
Whoa.	Thanks!
It's going great, Danni! In opposite world!	How's the whole moving on thing going?
Probably not.	Well, I just wanted to say goodbye. I was gonna stick around for a few more days, but I don't really feel like that there's a reason to. ...Is there?
I'm gonna miss you, too.	I'm gonna miss you.
Oh! That was good! No! No, I was doing the same thing!	Dude, we just met I was kidding.
Drive safe.	Adios.
So black people can get black eyes, too, huh? Who knew?	I told ya!
She thought you were robbing the house.	I haven't had one this bad since your Nana Hobbs threw that rock at me.
Here it comes. I'm incompetent. I'm a girl. I'm a little girl. I'm a little girl with pigtails that rides a tricycle.	I don't wanna see you around here anymore, okay?All right, come on you guys, you all got work to do!
I think I do.	No. Well...yes, but I am honestly trying to tell you that I don't think I was being clear with you before. In fact, I think I was being a pretty lousy teacher. Look, I think putting one in the "win" column every now and then is what gives us the juice to keep plugging along in games that we know deep down we're not gonna win. And that's why I locked in so intensely to that patient. Because opportunities, they...God, they come along so rarely in this place. And when they do, you just can't let them slip through your fingers. You cannot. You know?
I wasn't sure what I was hoping for. ...That somehow Danni had decided not to leave...that she'd snapped her leg in the parking lot....	I think I do.
DANNI!?	I wasn't sure what I was hoping for. ...That somehow Danni had decided not to leave...that she'd snapped her leg in the parking lot....
...All I knew was I'd missed an opportunity.	Yo.
No one knew her last name, no one even remembered seeing her. I started to wonder if Danni was even real. I guess that's the thing about life. You don't really	Jackass!
Excuse me!	Hey, J.D.
You don't really get many second chances.	Excuse me!
Oh! Danni! Hi! I'm sorry, sometimes I have this inner monologue running through my head.	You don't really get many second chances.
Don't. Stay here with me, we'll get that cup of coffee.	I'm having dinner with my sister tonight, but I swear I'm leaving after that.
Okay, two cups...and some pie.	I'm not gonna stick around for one cup of coffee.
Finally, I found a girl with no complications.	Okay, two cups...and some pie.
Oh, come on.	Oh, I see you've met my sister!
Ah, you're right, I'm sorry."Big Al" for example....	J.D., I haven't even had coffee yet.
Okay. Once there was a beautiful girl who met a stunningly handsome young doctor....	Why don't you just tell me a story? Something romantic.
He noticed her right away.And she noticed him noticing her.Their first date was amazing.They had so much fun together, they felt like kids again.Then it was time for their first kiss.	Okay. Once there was a beautiful girl who met a stunningly handsome young doctor....
Intense.	And...how was that?
Whoa! Woo! Agh!	Intense.
The next date didn't start that well, either......but it got better from there.And that night, well...	Whoa! Woo! Agh!
...it was the most amazing night the young doctor ever had.	The next date didn't start that well, either......but it got better from there.And that night, well...
And then the young doctor realized he hadn't seen the beautiful girl naked in the light yet.Damn!	And then what happened?
If I wasn't crazy about ya, would I be willing to do this?Doom-doom, bah, do-doom-doom, dop-bop...	Are you as into this as I am?
As I was doing the Naked Chicken Dance that my uncle Bart had taught me, I realized that life couldn't get much better than this.	If I wasn't crazy about ya, would I be willing to do this?Doom-doom, bah, do-doom-doom, dop-bop...
...doom-doom, dop-dop, doom	As I was doing the Naked Chicken Dance that my uncle Bart had taught me, I realized that life couldn't get much better than this.
My bad.It's a beautiful shot of you.	Okay! Now, just because Jordan thinks it's cute that you're violating her little sister doesn't mean that you can use my guest-room for your nerdy, G-rated sexcapades.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooooooo!	Aww, you're okay, Little Buddy!
I always am.Ah! Ow!You know, I hit my head so hard I actually saw cartoon birds. Then I realized I was in Pediatrics and it was just the wallpaper! Ha!	Be brilliant today!
"...waffles of mine..."	Stunning. Look, Tammy, as far as your love life goes, normally I couldn't care less who's laying your quivering body down by the fire while your lips whisper "No, no...no" but your eyes scream, "Yes. Yes. Oh, big daddy, yes!" But when you're dating Jordan's sissy-poo, it forces me to spend time with you outside of the hospital, and I just won't have that. So, hhhere's the deal: Don't want to have dinner with you. Don't want to go bowling with you. And I never, ever again want to walk into my kitchen and hear you say, "Ohh, it's waffle time! It's waffle time! Won't you have some waffles of mine?"
She's my patient!	Bottom line: We'll be bestest friends foreverest if you just keep your face out of my face. Uh-huh.Awwww.
You know, if you leave it on the counter for an hour, you can just drink it like a milkshake. Except, watch out if that block's not totally melted, hits you in the face!	Hey guys, how are you? I'm great! You know me, I'm up, up, up, up, up, and then some fashion nazi on the E! Network says that pear-shaped people shouldn't wear stripes, and whoosh, guess who's ear-deep in mint-chocolate chip ice cream. Meheehee.
Yeah, one time I got Chunky Monkey in my eye.	Oh, that'd go everywhere.
Oh, uh, her landlord found her passed out on her floor.	What brings Ms. Tracy to us?
A recent study found that doctors spend an average of fifteen seconds listening to a patient.It sounds insensitive, but the truth is it's all the time you need.	Yeah, lucky me, I couldn't pay my rent this month.
Those two are like best friends now, huh?	Look, you keep going to the right, so this time aim at that guy to the left, and you'll hit the board.
I know.	Wait a second, dude, wa that was us.
Ms. Tracy, we found some organophosphates in your system. Have you had any recent exposure to pesticides?	Oh, me? No, no, never my fiancé dumped me. I'm just noticing how beautiful his mother's ring is. You know, compared to the fake one I sent back to him. Oops!
They're just feelings; they'll heal.	Oh, God, that must be so nice!
The carnival!?Oh, I can't go to the carnival, Danni. I puke at carnivals...a lot.	Jordan just said we should all go to the carnival tonight.
I do. But I still love 'em!	You don't really puke at carnivals, do you.
Oh, yeah, it's only the back-and-forthy rides that get me.	So, we'll meet you guys on the Ferris wheel.Only if your stomach's okay.
That __is__ weird....	Well, you have done it. It's Friday night, and instead of being at home, drinking whiskey through my son's sippy cup, I'm actually at a carnival with you, surrounded by piles of manure even though I've yet to see a single animal!
First of all, I already raised the hammer; and the only reason I didn't ring the bell is that the game is obviously rigged.	Uh-huh. I'll tell you what, how 'bout we head right on over there, and if you can raise that hammer above your head with those chicken bones you call arms, I'll let you take a free whack at my dome.
Look, the only positive thing about this whole situation is that it's driving you crazy and there's nothing you can do about it.	Uh-huh.
Oh, come on!	Way to go, Gina!
There are a lot of different ways to get the upper hand in a relationship.	She's having a reaction to the Benzo.
Oh, I gave the guy half a corn-dog so we can all ride foursies!	There are a lot of different ways to get the upper hand in a relationship.
It can happen with a simple request...	Corn-dog!
...it can happen because of a mistake...	COULD YOU TAKE A LOOK AT MY EARS?
Still, even when you have the upper hand, it's important to be careful. Because some people fight dirty.	What do you think, Carla? Did you think that maybe I'm the doctor? 'Cause that's what I think. So maybe you should just DC the vest like I asked, and keep your opinion to yourself.
I don't feel so good.	Uh, sorry, folks. A little problem here. Get you down in about an hour or so.
And, Danni, that whole thing with Jordan......it's so long ago, I don't even remember it.	I'm sorry I wore sandals.
Gotta stop showing that to new girlfriends!	J.D., you keep a sex journal of all your experiences under your bed.
Oh, thank God! Do you wanna get some pineapple pizza?	Look, you shoulda told me. But I'm not gonna let things like this mess it up with the guy I'm falling in love with.
That's robot for "Goodnight.""Peace!" Heh.	I think I'll probably just go inside and wash my feet.
Well, you know....We gotta go.Hey, you should know your little cheap shot didn't land, because Danni isn't mad at me at all.Hey, Baby! You comin' to give pop-pop some candy? 'Cause I'm hungry!Oh okay, later's fine too.	Thanks, guys. Honestly, I can't remember the last time anyone was this nice to me.
Oh, I'm sorry.	Oh, de-de-de isn't it enough that I'm reading it!?
You start and stop a lot.	Always fun to be in the bathroom listening to people talk so clearly, you're sure they just heard you pee. You did, didn't you.
I'm a girl, that's original.	Lovely. Here.Uh, actually there's great news, uh, Ms. Tracy: We're sending you home. Although, I sure wish we could have figured out how that stuff got introduced into your system to begin with. But sometimes in medicine you have to just chalk it up to life's great mysteries, like crop circles or this gal's Adam's apple.
Wanna hear a great letter?	You be well, darlin'.I'll see you next time.
Guilt?	No. Not that.
Look, Danni, I know you're upset about your sister and I	I...I don't like her to be right.
Then what is it?	J.D., if I didn't go out with the guys my sister slept with, I wouldn't have even had a date to the prom.
"Thank you"?	Last night I told you I was falling in love with you. And you know what you said?
No.... _Pineapple_ pizza.	You asked me if I wanted to go get pizza.
And for some reason, right then, we both knew how those pesticides had gotten in our patient's system.	Oh, come on. You know what? I hope you guys listen better to your patients.
She did it to herself.	Oh, me? No, no, never my fiancé dumped me.I honestly can't remember the last time anyone was this nice to me.Hey, you guys, I just want to say, if I don't see you again, thanks and take care.
I guess the problem with only listening to a patient for fifteen seconds is, sometimes you don't hear everything...and when you finally realize what they were trying to say, you might've lost them forever.	We gotta go.
Ms. Tracy.	I guess the problem with only listening to a patient for fifteen seconds is, sometimes you don't hear everything...and when you finally realize what they were trying to say, you might've lost them forever.
We need to talk.	Hey, guys!
You can never underestimate the importance of listening.	Come on, Jill. Come on.
Listening can effect your career.	Get off that thing.
Listening can even mend a friendship.	Who's Ted?
Ultimately, it keeps you in the moment...so you don't miss the things that really matter.	Just give him one gram of Ancef for prophylaxis.
So say it again.	Ultimately, it keeps you in the moment...so you don't miss the things that really matter.
I'll try.	No, you have to earn it.
Whether you've been together for a few weeks...	I am so late, I don't even have time to eat.
Yes.	Do you wanna have sex?
...or together for three years.	Yes.
Carla! You can't ask a guy that while he's driving!	See ya!
Yes, it was your bad, Carla.	My bad.
...Or whether you've been together for more than five years.	Yes, it was your bad, Carla.
What happened?	When I was in high school, I went to Europe for a month and I forgot to take my birth control pills, so I took like thirty the day I got home.
I think the Janitor's pretending to be British.	Yeah.
No it doesn't!	That means "nice haircut."
I guess around here, you have to be prepared for anything.	Mind your own beeswax.
Mmm, Britishy!	I guess around here, you have to be prepared for anything.
...Especially if you're dealing with a patient who needs emergency surgery.	Mmm, Britishy!
Turk!	Right on.
Wow. You must be dancing on the wind right now.	What?
That is so fabulous!	Dude, today I had to sink or swim all on my own; and guess what? A brother swam.
Maybe it's just Buddha's way of telling her to slow down a little, you know?	Heh. Still.
So, I've been asking around, and apparently you're known as one of three people: Nigel, the Brit; Klaus, the dim-witted German yes, I said "dim-witted or a simple, good-natured stutterer named Efrem.	Ohh! Classic Nigel!
Excuse me. Dude, she's got a boyfriend.	Oh, I work at a hospital. I'm a resident, which is actually still kind of like a student. Well, not a student as in, like, dorm rooms and pizza runs and crazy, drunken kissing parties which I know for a fact still go on in Radiology but more of a student in the sense that
Why didn't you just tell him you were a doctor?	Thanks, man.
Yeah, but I didn't, like, make a big deal out of it.	I don't know.... I guess I just still don't feel like a doctor, you know? I mean, that whole thing with Turk today really got me thinking. Like, I've ran codes before, but there's always been someone right there ready to bail me out. Like, I've never had that one defining, sink-or-swim moment.
We just got here! Look around!We actually had a fun night...until he urinated all over my rental car.	I thought you said there'd be some bitches here?
Harrison Ford, hands down....But you were probably talking to Carla. I'm having such a gay day!	I love 'The Fugitive'. Who would you rather sleep with, Tommy Lee Jones or Harrison Ford?
Yeah! It's just this whole janitor thing has thrown me for a loop.	"Day"?
I won't, sweetie, trust me.	Danni, we should watch the movie in Turk's room, because he's gonna keep talking about the janitor, even though we begged him not to.
I just wanna know what kind of freak needs to spend all day pretending to be somebody else!	Let's go.
Janitor!	Uh, listen, this is ____unit number 23. I got a possible sighting of Richard Kimball on northbound ______.Kimball!
Sometimes the moment you've been waiting for comes at the most inopportune time.	Standing up, against the wall, you holding me up. What do you say, Romeo?
Sometimes the moment comes when you feel like you've been waiting for it your whole life. You just have to hope that no one beats you in there and steals your thunder.'Cause if they do, well...you're just gonna end up standing in the corner, watching.	Arggghhh! Oh, yeah! Ohhhh, yeah!
Get outta the way! They're trying to get through!Okay, start a line. Hyperventilate, here we go.	Yeah?
Oh, please, I put my pants on one leg at a time, just like you guys....Except, after I put my pants on, I save your husband's life! Oh, no he didn't!Ohh, Smelliot! What's the happie-haps!	Yeah.... That's our 'Citizen Kane'.... Anyway, thanks again. You're a real hero.
What is wrong with you? Is this because I called you "Smelliot"? Because I can't believe you haven't heard that before.	I guess I just love you so...much...?
Hey, everybody! She's cool with "Smelliot"!	J.D., I don't care if you call me that.
This isn't about moments, it's about saving lives. Elliot, when I put my pants on	Look, J.D., that was my patient; I was one step behind you, and you knew it. You stole my moment.
Game over, Klaus. I saw you in 'The Fugitive'.	You're a fireman! What are we doing?
Cut!	Well, that's my cue. Action!
Can you believe her? She says I beat her to that code because I still have feelings for her. I don't even think about her that way anymore.	Him.
Whatevah!	Dude, you can't _not_ think about her that way.
That's what's up.	Okay, think about her right now.Now think about her and Sean together.Now think about her and me together.
Yeah....	Kissing her all three times, except the third time you were a black guy?
At the end of the day, medicine's pretty competitive; so I guess you have to do whatever's right for you.	Dr. Reid
Go.	At the end of the day, medicine's pretty competitive; so I guess you have to do whatever's right for you.
Watching Elliot in there, I couldn't help but be impressed.	We're gonna need to do an emergency trach. Get the scalpel and the trach. kit. Go on.
She was amazing.	Hurry! Faster!
Unfortunately, in medicine, even if you do everything perfectly......there are still no guarantees.	Let's go, you guys! Come on!
Sorry.	Unfortunately, in medicine, even if you do everything perfectly......there are still no guarantees.
Some people hide from who they really are.	Goo-goo-goo-goodnight...doctor.
Others eventually accept who they are.	I'm old.
But sometimes it's the tough moments that help you realize who you've finally become.	Sure, let's get your big Irish ass to your car so nobody knows that you hurt your back! Let's not worry about my back!
No to "black" or no to "whale"?	No.
I looked because you did the "hey idiot" thing to me, like, six months ago.	Hey, idiot.I said "idiot" and you looked.
Yeah.	Did you look then?
You know what? I think you're out of ways to bother me.	Heh.
Think of a way to annoy me right now.That's what I thought.	No, you're wrong.
Elliot and her marine biologist boyfriend, at it again.So Elliot's marine biologist boyfriend comes back for the weekend just as my girlfriend leaves town for the holidays.But you know what? It doesn't bother me!	Come here, Aquaman. One more patient and then we're gettin' out of here.
Oh really, that's great, I hope they don't maul you.	J.D., Sean's gonna let me swim with the dolphins this weekend.
Yes! I knew you'd end up liking it!	You rang?
Shouldn't you at least buy her breakfast?	Mrs. Cantwell, just have to give you a quick pelvic exam, so throw your feet up in these stirrups here and, uh, scoot your tushie down.Come on, Sean, let's go!
Oh, I'm sorry. What what's up? What's happening with the other thing?	Dude!
Elliot come on, I have never heard a woman make sounds like that!	That's great.
Well, you might want to double-check with YOUR MOM!	See, it's funny because you've never really satisfied a woman!
Around here we all make fun of each other.Except for Carla. _No one_ makes fun of Carla.	Well, you might want to double-check with YOUR MOM!
Heeey! How are the new happy parents?	Oh, I'm not
So, uh, you and Jordan...huh? You wanna talk about it?	You make me want to kill myself and everybody around me! Ohh... Come, Dixie.
Thanks.	This guy's sick.
See, now you're just embarrassing yourself. Pick someone else to annoy!	You're stupid!
Uh, you know sir, I know that it's cancer, but I'm not really worried.	Rats! Excuse my language, dear. You know what, Catherine, I can see this conversation being riddled with that kind of talk. Perhaps you should wait out in the hallway.
Ow!	No you're not. I think what Captain Bedside here
Yes, and there's an opening in surgery tonight, I managed to jam you in. Look, I know this is happening awfully fast, you must have a lot of emotions swirling around, but I want you to know if you have any questions at all, I'm here.	is _trying_ to say is that it hasn't spread to the lymph nodes yet, so it's still quite easily operable.
Bravo, Tuesdays at 10, 9 central, 8 Mountain.	It's okay, tell him.
How's it going?	Oh, lookathat, message from Jordan.
Dr. Cox, we've known each other for over two years.... Let me in, okay? Help me help you. Help me help you, help me help you	Hey, watch it!
-Help me, help you-	Stop it.
Well, that's easy! Just tell her about it. Tell her everything you feel.	Fine, Newbie! Let me let me tell you a little story. It starts every day at 5 in the morning which is just about the time that you're setting your hair for work when I am awakened by a sound: Is that a cat being gutted by a fishing knife? Nooo! That's my son. He's hungry and he's got a load in his pants so big that I'm actually considering hiring a stable boy. But, I go ahead and dig in; because I do love the lad and, well gosh, you know me, I'm a giver. And I'm off to the hospital, where my cup runneth over with both quality colleagues, such as yourself, and a proverbial clown-car full of sick people. But, what the hey, my pay is about the same as guys who break rocks with other rocks and I only have to work three or four hundred hours a week, so, so far I'm a pretty happy camper! And then I head back home where I'm greeted by the faint musk of baby vomit in a house that used to smell like, well...nothing! Nothing! Nothing! I-i-in fact it used to smell like nothing at all. And all I want to do before I restart this whole glorious cycle is, you know, maybe lay on the couch and have a beer and watch some SportsCenter and, if I'm not too sweaty from the day's labors, stick my hand right down my pants, buuut apparently that's not in Jordan's definition of "pulling your weight".
First of all, no one understands relationships like Billy Joel, okay? "Uptown Girl" got me through high school long story for another day. Secondly, you don't want to end up like the Randolphs back there, just not saying a word to each other, do you?You wish _we_ were more like the Randolphs, don't you?	Should I give her every reason to accept that I'm for real?
Oh, who's fault is it?	You know, it's not my fault that dirty stuff makes me uncomfortable.
This is a job for Miss Busybody Smartypants!	She was always yelling at Jorge in that potting shed. But she never fired him. Even after he kidnapped her and took her to Acapulco....
Turk, it's been like eighteen hours since you had sex.	Dude, I'm dying here.
So why don't you just, like, "take care of yo'self"?	I'm saying, this is torture!
You don't?	Man, you know I don't do that.
Same here.	Nah, I only did that like twice in my life.
If by "in my life" you mean "since I got home".If by "in my life" you mean "since dinner".	Same here.
I gotta go to sleep, I'm tired.	If by "in my life" you mean "since I got home".If by "in my life" you mean "since dinner".
We gotta get that lock fixed.	Ohhhhh, my little newbie-doobie-doo! Say, that whole "telling Jordan how I feel" thing just went terrific, thank you for that. Now I need a place to crash. Where's Naomi's bedroom? Good night, roomies.
If you're not gonna use my bed, can I use it?	Man, that's tough.
You told her that spending the day with the baby isn't really a job and that it's turned her into an inflexible shrew!	No you may not, on account of this whole Jordan situation being your fault.
You know, Dr. Cox, I I know this is tough on you what with you being psychotic and all, but, I'm out, okay? It's 3 a.m. and there's nothing in the world that's gonna keep me from going to sleep right now.	Newbie, you told me to tell her exactly how I feel, I did just that. Now you'll remain on the floor until you come up with a new plan for me.
No, sir, those are, at best, a stall. Now I know there's trepidation when you talk about surgery in the area of the penis	Catherine downloaded some information on alternative treatments diet, exercise, seed implants....
Look, I	Whoa! Quick pause on the guttertalk! Catherine, hallway.
I know there are possible side-effects, but the incontinence goes away with most patients, and sexual dysfunction can be treated with anything from Viagra to a penis pump.	Go.
Doesn't have to be.	Penis pump? That sounds awkward.
Oh, are we allowed to do this now? What about that whole, like, hands on the hips, "Carla from the block" thing she does when she's mad when she's like "Oh, Bambi, you do _not_ want to mess me with right now."	A little? Girl, please! If you met Jesus hisself, you'd be trying to tell him where to park his donkey.
"Careful, Doug."	Careful Doug, we are not that close yet.
"Doug, you better be careful, 'cause I'm Carla."Mr. Randolph.	That's what's up. Mm-mm. Mmm.
Listen sir, I brought Dr. Turk here to help you get over your fear of surgery.	I was right, Catherine!
Then what is it?	I'm not scared.
You're joshing!	No, I can't
Oh, God.	Wow.
Maybe the dirty little secret about sex is that it isn't so dirty after all.	the walls come tumbling down. It's the one place that I can tell her how wonderful and beautiful she is, and how I would be lost without her. Now I know I will probably have to have this surgery eventually, but until then I am not going to risk losing the one thing that keeps me close to her. Not until I absolutely have to.Yes dear, you can come in.
Uh, excuse me.	Oh, this is me mature. La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!
Okay, so there's that.... Uh, look, I realize I let you down before, and I was thinking I could make it up to you by, you know, maybe baby-sitting sometime.	Whaaat?!
The weird thing is, even though it's natural, sex can make us uncomfortable.	Okay, so there's that.... Uh, look, I realize I let you down before, and I was thinking I could make it up to you by, you know, maybe baby-sitting sometime.
But if we work at it, we can get beyond that discomfort.And realize that sex can actually be a comfort.	That is so hot.
Sex can even be a cure.	I'll get the condoms.Sorry.
How do I know all this? Because no one understands how important sex is better than someone who isn't having any.	Oh, I don't even remember.
Helloooo, Cinemax.	How do I know all this? Because no one understands how important sex is better than someone who isn't having any.
...Turk will start a fight with Carla that he'll inevitably lose...	But sir! I was going to visit The Alamo with the guys from my public sp ...speaking class!
...Sean and Elliot will do whatever they can to keep their long-distance relationship going...	Holler!
Why?	Hey. Don't open your locker for the next couple of days.
Still, all you need to break the pattern is for something shocking to happen. Like, say, Dr. Cox being in a good mood.	Why?
You see, when Dr. Cox is in a good mood, well, it flows out of him like a cool breeze that lifts the spirits of everyone it touches.	You know, Kyle, after three long years of watching you climb that transplant list, I finally have a liver with your name on it.Check Mr. Iverson into Sacred Heart for the last time, will ya?
It's always hard to work with terminally ill patients.	Really?God, I wish I was ethnic!
Anyway, the point is, silence is awesome.	Hmm.
Who?Owwwwwwwwwwww! ...Why?Powerful tiny fists....	Be careful, though, Randall got loose.
Sure. Just bring your own toilet paper. It's...kind of a little rule we have with our guests.Preferably something two-ply!	I gotta get out of there. You think maybe I could crash at your house?
I already told her.	Oh, cool.... Bring toilet paper.
Dr. Cox said he liked me!?	How'd you get Dr. Cox to like you?
I need to know three things immediately: Where was he when he said it, what inflection did he use, and had he been drinking? You know what, I don't care about the third one; sometimes when you've been drinking you're the most truthful.	No, you're missing the point
You know what? I'm glad he was drunk.	Okay, look, I know Carla's gonna have her little pre-wedding panic attack, and what if she has her good ol' buddy Dr. Cox there to tell her what a jackass I am, huh? Then what?
Randall, could you stop using that expression? Because I can't get it out of my head.	Two months!? That's a real punch in the crotch!
You know, but she's not moving in permanently. She's just crashing for a while.	See ya!
Isn't Mariana your mother?	Same thing happened to me. After my divorce, I told Mariana I was going to crash at her place for a few weeks, and we've been sharing a bed for eight years.
How long will you be staying?	Lookit, here's the rule, there, porn-star: The moment her toothbrush hits your sink, you've got yourself a permanent roomie.
There'll be toilet paper everywhere!	For a while.Mmmmm, downy soft.
Konnichiwa.	Why you gotta be playa-hatin'?
Wow. Danni is so sweet. What am I worried about?	I love how much you guys care about your patients.
What the hell!? What's it gonna be like when she's at my place!?	You know, Jordan and I are from around here, and our friend Chuck's a stripper? I'm sure he knows tons of guys that would love to have sex with your patient.
Danni! Can you have the guys practice in the other room, please?	What the hell!? What's it gonna be like when she's at my place!?
There'll be banana hammocks everywhere!	Stop being such a fuddy-duddy! Now, who haven't I slept with yet?
Sometimes we forget that rules are there for a reason. Other times, well...	You know I'm right.
Other times, rules are meant to be broken.	Ooh!
And once in a while, you have to throw all the rules out the window and know that everything's gonna be okay.	That was worth the wait! You are a stallion!
Me too!	I feel really good about this!
...Or not.Of course, some rules are just plain silly.	Me too!
Thanks, pal!	I sure did! Why?
Hold up!Chapped!	Uh-huh....
With the long hours at a hospital, you don't have time to worry about your appearance.It may sound sexist, but with the female doctors, it's slightly more noticeable.	Easy, Moose , that stuff is forty bucks a tin.
Hey, Janice. Is it windy out?	With the long hours at a hospital, you don't have time to worry about your appearance.It may sound sexist, but with the female doctors, it's slightly more noticeable.
Because I'm I'm captain of m-m-my kite-flying team? The M-m-mighty Kites?	No. Why do you always ask me that!?
Agh! Okay, just say something innocuous.	Because I'm I'm captain of m-m-my kite-flying team? The M-m-mighty Kites?
Good morning, gentlemen.	Agh! Okay, just say something innocuous.
The truth is most of them don't even bother trying. Except of course...	Good morning, gentlemen.
How do you have the time to look so good every morning?	Hey, girlfriends!
Anyway, where's Danni? We're gonna be late for our movie.	Hi, Daddy!
Yeeeaaah, but we're not really that serious.This isn't the movies?	Wow, she's using the "L word" now.
Yeah. She wants to move in together. I have to break up with her!	Out of body experience?
Ooh!	Dude, relax. Enjoy the show. Have a Bugle.
I wanted to put them on my fingers and pretend I had witch nails.	J.D.!?
Nothing.	What?!
Hey!	To the morgue! Watch it!
I was going to last night, but then I looked in her eyes, and I realized how rare it is to meet someone who's actually willing to have sex with me.	So, did you break up with her?
Okay, you know how the, uh, couch in the living room has those high arms...?	How did you have sex with the woman you're about to break up with?
His mom doesn't die. Tyra uses her connections in the supermodel world to get government scientists to put Turk's mom's brain into Heidi Klum's body. She falls in love with me, we all move in together.	Tell her.
Mm, and I would love her, too.	It'd be awkward at first, but I'd make it work.... 'Cause I love my mom.
Mighty Kiiiiites!	Me too.
"Stringent updoc".It's happening.	Stringent what?
He's right. I don't like hurting people. But with Danni, I'm gonna do the honorable thing I'm gonna have someone in a fireman's outfit tell her I burned to death.	Baby, listen, I'm just trying to keep my man psyched, 'cause since I've known J.D., he's never broken up with anyone.
Listen, Danni.......Lisa.... Drunk girl who was friends with the girl I really wanted to hook up with.... It's not all of you. It's me.Scott Gerber?!	Bambi, you owe her closure. Hell, you owe it to every woman you've ever dated.
I thought you meant teammates!	At soccer camp, I told you I wanted to be more than friends.
He used to...borrow my jersey and wear it as jammies....	Well, I didn't!
Oh, that's great. Uh, listen, something's been on my mind....	I'm keeping busy.
Awesome.	Me too. I just feel like my life is so scattered lately and you're the only good thing I have going right now.
I am trying to break someone's heart here, okay!?	The boy's got no biscuits.
Actually, I'm kinda swamped right now, uh, let me get back to you, okay?Elliot, what's wrong?	I'm feeling really bummed. Do you have a second to talk?
Come on! I always have time for you!	Eh, forget it, you're busy.
Huh? I've never heard anything like that! Why?	What? No! No way! Why would you say that?
Hello, citizens! Welcome to Sacred Heart! Home of the world's most giant doctor! Be not afraid! I'm just like you! Except I'm giant!My tush is chafing.	They all had really important things to do?
Turk, we tried playing Giant Black Guy. Remember what happened? People ran.	All right! My turn to get on top!
Besides, I gotta go deal with this whole Danni thing.	Damn!
Nah, that's weak. I mean, if someone doesn't care about you enough to break up with you themselves, it's like they didn't ever care about you at all.	You want me to just talk to her for you? I'll do it.
What?	Hey, guys. Ohh! J.D., Danni's breaking up with you. Mm, darn. See ya!
I still don't understand why Danni's breaking up with me, man. I gotta go talk to her.Okay, first of all, words cannot describe the smell that is currently on my cheek.	Oh...I think it's this one.Dude, look at the size of this Odor-Eater! We could surf on it!
Ha! I'm sorry, did I interrupt you from trying to eat your baby?	Little piece of advice: Your honker's cute in person. Peep-hole? Not your friend.
Look, do you know how hard it was for me to come here?	Danni's not here.
Oooog! Oh, God....	Gotcha!
Say what you want, those big round cheeks are warm in the morning....	Get your coffee on, dawg.
I just wanna know why she broke up with me.	What?
Not cool.	Well, why don't you just...hey! Ask her yourself!
Oh, that is so stupid. Elliot, you look...smart.	Hey, Elliot. Is it greasy outside?
Maybe that's why Danni wants to break up with me, she thinks I'm too smart!	"What's up, doc?" I just got it!
Listen....	You're dating a guy named Danny? Is he hot?
I know it's a cliché, but ______ say that it is indeed the calm before the storm that lets you know that danger's coming.	Listen....
Uh-oh.	I know it's a cliché, but ______ say that it is indeed the calm before the storm that lets you know that danger's coming.
After Dr. Cox exploded at us, so many thoughts were racing through my head: We have been slacking off lately. How did Doug get such incredible abs? And what the hell is the deal with Danni?	Clear!
Hey.After you dressed up Rowdy, did you trim the clumpy areas around his butt?	Hey.
Oh.... Thanks. He was due for a good grooming.	Yeah...?
Just tell me why.	Look....
What?	Your cell phone wasn't turned off.
Actually I'm swamped, Danni. Sorry, I gotta go.	When you called me.
Come on! I always have time for you!That stupid phone! You know, that's the same way Turk found out I collect scarves!	Oh.... Forget it, you're busy.
Ooooh!	Come on! I always have time for you!That stupid phone! You know, that's the same way Turk found out I collect scarves!
Sorry.	J.D.
Hey! I finally broke up with someone!	you're still not over Elliot. And until you are, no one's ever gonna have a chance to get close to you. Right?That silence? That's you breaking up with me.
Everybody has their own way of getting through the day.For some, it's as simple as standing up for a friend......and getting away with it.	I look hot!
As for me, if I'm not over Elliot, I might as well wait it out for the long haul. After all, it doesn't mean I'm gonna ignore opportunity if it falls in my lap.	I I know what you're thinking, believe me, I...I do: Why in the world would a civilized, up-town man of the millennium such as myself even go ahead and give a good rat's ass about whether a bunch of snot-nosed baby docs were afraid of him. Right? Well, unfortunately the only way I know how to teach is through fear.And again, sorry about the gay sailor's outfit. Your mother _loves_ it. She couldn't be more pleasant when you have it on. Take it off nut bag. Have it on pleasant, approachable....
Okay...!	Leave me alone.
Oh, this is gonna suck.	J.D.! Let's get going. Sean's calling me at home in like ten minutes.
Nope.	You look like you could use some help.
Even random people.	Nope.
No thanks, Dr...whatever your name is.	You need help, Dr. Dorian?
They won't leave me alone.	No thanks, Dr...whatever your name is.
Piss off, Mickhead.	Free help, here.
You'd think by now they'd know where I'm gonna end up.	Piss off, Mickhead.
Dr. Cox? I could use a little help.	You'd think by now they'd know where I'm gonna end up.
Yeah, if you wanna use the appearance angle to knock down my self-esteem, best to do it on a day when my hair doesn't look awesome! I know it's new wax.	Beyoncé, you could use a lot of help. But, hey, we all have to play the hand the Big Guy dealt us. You know, unless you're lucky enough to have those insanely over-hyped 'Queer Eye' guys show up at your door, but I doubt even they have the brass ones necessary to fix whatever the hell this is.
It's okay to want a piece!I just want you to check out Mrs. Barlow's chart; I'm always second-guessing myself when it comes to interstitial lung diseases.	What is?
Got it.	Oh, then you should definitely handle this yourself, there, Britney.
Oh.	Noo.... I'm a good doctor.
I couldn't believe it either!	New wax did that?
Oh, that's fine. We were talking man talk...you know....	Oh.Ye oh, sorry about the girl talk.
Solo-Flex...	Really big trucks...
Sweat.	Have you seen these lately?
Well, your breath smells like chimichangas!	Your hair smells like Elliot's.
I think what Carla really smelled was all the excitement in the air. See, there's a visiting professor coming today who's both a medical attending and a surgeon. _Two_ specialties, and to us that kinda makes him......Super-Doc!...Super-Doc...	Maybe....
...Fine. A super-doc with obsessive-compulsive disorder.	Dammit!
Huh?	Hers.And his.
The jar said unisex.	That's very pretty. And deeply disturbing.
_Unisex_.	I know.
Dammit!	I know.
It's just that you're...you're a doctor with pretty severe OCD.	Dr. Kevin Casey.... Dr. Kevin Casey.It's okay, you can say it.
I know. I always talk like this.	It's not a secret.
I can do it!	You're gonna have a hard time keeping that up the whole month I'm here.
I can't imagine you as a resident.	Boy, who doesn't!You realize I haven't laid eyes on you since we were residents together? And I'll tell you this, big Kev-o, I always knew I'd see ya again.Boy, I never thought I'd see that guy again!
Was the blond hair and the earring 'cause you were in a rock band or 'cause you loved pirates?	Shut up, jackass! I rock!
Loved pirates! Just like me!	What?
Well you're the only one. Okay?	I _don't_ want a piece.
Dr. Cox, you are not now, nor will you ever be, my mentor.	Look, Pink, for the billionth time, no, I will not go out for a beer with you. Now repeat after me: Dr. Cox, you are not now, nor will you ever be, my mentor.
It's a great sign.	Suicidal scavenger birds also an excellent sign, right Doctor?
You are unflappable!	Okie-dokie, artichokie.
I'm more skittish.	It's true I can't be flapped.
I wish a was a swashbuckling doctor. You know...like a pirate.	Yeah, you know, you're like a big squirrel.
Enough about pirates! Wait until you know him better.	I wish a was a swashbuckling doctor. You know...like a pirate.
You going to the, uh... O.Arrr? Heh.	Ahoy, there.
I said enough!	You going to the, uh... O.Arrr? Heh.
Dr. Casey.	You know, I couldn't have survived in medicine if I didn't embrace my OCD. And since I was compulsive anyway, you know, I I read the same text books over and over, I, uh, I went through the procedures over and over, I imagined every worst-case scenario over and over and over and over and over and over and over
Dr. Casey!	and over and over and over
Oh.	Dr. Kevin Casey.
Yeah.	Thank you.
It's weird, after one day it already felt like he was the type of mentor I always wished Dr. Cox would be. Still, I've gotta stay cool; I know I'm prone to hero worship.	Even though my crazy brain made me do those things, it's still the best advice I can give to any young doctor: Expect the unexpected and you will never be surprised.
Really? 'Cause I don't feel the daaaaaaaiiiiiioooooooowwww...heh-heh-how cool is thaaaat!	Man, the surgeon in me is antsy. I need to cut somebody up.Thanks for volunteering. I'm not really that strong on the brain. I think this is the language center.
Impossible ! Je ne parle pas Français !	And this is the foreign language center.
MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!	The cow says...
BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!	The sheep says...
The French would help with the ladies....	Ladies and gentlemen, Macaulay Culkin...
Here's that CT scan you ordered!	I know. But soon enough I established myself as the best damn doctor that ever roamed around these filthy halls; which is a curse, actually, because now I'm expected to make eye contact with every insult to medicine that comes into this dump.
Eye contact! He respects me!	Thank. You.
Do chickens wish they could fly?	J.D., do you wanna get a beer tonight?
I like to think they do.	I have no idea.
I don't know why it popped into my head...	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Ties are for sissies. Speaking of which, Newbie? You have been uncharacteristically quiet.
You really had trouble with metabolic diseases?	I don't know why it popped into my head...
...but I knew I had him.	Noo.... I'm a good doctor.
My question is concerning metabolic diseases.Oh, yes.	...but I knew I had him.
It's funny how one person can shake another's foundation to the core. Half the time, the guy doesn't even know he did it!	Fabry's Disease. Page two thousand, ninety-eight of Harrison's Guide to Internal Medicine.
Funnier still how the same guy could be the mentor I've always been looking for.	Yep. He's out of our league.
Yeah.... Reminds me of my first girlfriend. She was a carnie.You know, I'm always trying to get Cox to come out and get a beer with me he never does.	Nice place. It's got that that great...vomit and peanut smell.
Ahhhh, perfect!Well, I don't carry anything around....	Hey, you're not one of those guys who carries around pictures of him and his attending, are you?
Totally.	Good. 'Cause you know, those those losers who've been practicing medicine for three years but are still looking for some kind of mentor to pat 'em on the back are just...pathetic, you know what I mean?
Yep. It's funny what one person can do.	Totally.
What's worse is that the guy who caused it thinks we're his best friends.	Stop looking at me or die.
Hey, yeah.	Whatta say there, Kev.
Uh.	Uh.
Uhhh.... That guy!	Someone around here pissing you guys off? 'Cause I will give 'em some attitude.
You know!	That was awesome!
I've always felt like Doug understood me. It's weird; after knowing him for three years, I suddenly realized he was the type of mentor I always wished Dr. Cox would be.Wait!	You know!
Doug, get the hell outta here!	I've always felt like Doug understood me. It's weird; after knowing him for three years, I suddenly realized he was the type of mentor I always wished Dr. Cox would be.Wait!
I think when rational men are forced to face their shortcomings they all do the same thing: Blame Kevin Casey! Who gave him the right to judge me? 'Cause I sure didn't! I'll give him a piece of my mind! See how he likes it! Unfortunately no one knew where the son of a bitch was!	Okay.
Sorry, sir.	Dr. Dorian! I'm far too irritable right now to pretend I don't hate you, so let's cut to the chase.If you know where all the garbage in this hospital is going, I'll give you......eight dollars.
No, Kevin, I have to talk to you _right_ _now_.	Hey...hey.... Uh, give give me a minute, will you?
Later's cool too.	DAMMIT!
I'm sorry....	I'm sorry. I just, I... Look, I spent the last few days meeting new people and...trying to get used to this place, and I'm stressed and I'm fried......and I just want to go home.... But here's the punchline: even though my last surgery was two hours ago, I can't stop washing my damn hands.AAAAAAAAGGGGGGGHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
Nothing.	No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look...this is a weak moment. Nobody's supposed to see this. And, uh, mark my words, I'll clean up the soap. ...Probably several thousand times.Everyone's got their own burdens, J.D., and I'm not gonna be one of those people that dumps mine on somebody else. Now whatta you need?
None of us needed anything.	Nothing.
And Dr. Cox knows he has to find something else to hang his hat on.	Baby. Come to bed.
Still, it's not that daunting if you look around and see what other people have to deal with.	You, my friend, are going to be the best baseball player in the world. Which will make me the best baseball player in the world's father.Can't you hear it, Jack? Can't you hear it?
Goodnight, Dr. Casey.	Still, it's not that daunting if you look around and see what other people have to deal with.
...by touching everything in his first patient's room.	Bink. Bink. Bink. Bink, bink bink...
He touches everything.	Good morning, doctors.
Was it "I come from the land down under! Where women glow and men plunder!" That wasn't me.	It isn't "bink"! Stop saying "bink"!
I have been known to plunder.	Do you plunder?
Be careful with this guy, he's uh....	I'm sorry, you said that like it's a normal thing.
The bad kind.	Really!? My grandpa had that. Every morning he'd take a gym sock, fill it up with nickels, and just beat us! That's OCD, right?
Damn him. He's right.	You kiddin'? Oh, man! Just picture yourself, you're standing out here, in the open air, then you sit down and you take stock of your life.
Who'm I gonna tell?	Listen, pal. I don't want you telling anybody about my epiphany toilet.
And get this: He calls it his "epiphany toilet"!	Ehp! Don't even think about it!
You're like Dr. Casey. I think he said using that toilet would be like his Everest.	No one's offering.
Yep, that's what he said.	Using that toilet would be my Everest.
Oh, my God! _Would_ I have a threesome with Turk and Carla? Well, it's certainly flattering, and I don't think they'd tell anyone....	Turk wants to ask you something, and it would mean a lot to the both of us if you said yes.
Oh.	Will you be my best man?
I mean, YEAH! Of course!	Huh?
Thank you so much!	Hell yeah, you will!
A decoder ring! Heh.TURK!	So is this, like, the best moment you guys have ever had?
It finally happened!	What?
Double secret decoder ring-wearing doctors.Form of an ice menorah!	You guys realize you're doctors, right?
Oh, no!	Dude, I gotta go.
You see, a census said that hospital admissions dropped in February.The census...was wrong.	Oh!
And it wasn't just me. Dr. Casey has affected everyone.	Hey! Bink you!
What's he doing?	And it wasn't just me. Dr. Casey has affected everyone.
Yeah, Turk has asked me to be his best man. You got any advice?	I'm sorry, does mean stare at me like jackasses or does it mean get the hell over here?All right, then. Mr. Tanaka here is fatiguing and he needs to be intubated. Any questions?
So introduce yourself.	You know what sucks? Everyone keeps talking about how Dr. Casey has helped them, and he doesn't even know I exist!
Probably.	Why can't I sit on you!? Why?
Thanks. Thanks for coming back.	Newbie! It turns out I, uh, I do have some best man advice. Go easy on the mascara in case you cry during your toast. And if you're gonna chase after the bouquet with all of the other girls, make sure you kick off your pumps so you don't snap one of those chicken ankles of yours.
Even if you've done a procedure five thousand times, there's no guarantee you won't screw up number five thousand, one.	Barbie. Are you sure you went into his lungs? 'Cause it looks like you're blowing up his stomach.Aw, dammit, his O2 sat's dropping. Get out of the way, honey; come on.
Can I practice my toast on you?	A few more seconds, we would have been coding this guy.Barbie, as hard as it is to remember, but _air_ goes in _the lungs_.
I'm opening with a quote from 'Spartacus'.	No.
Well, come on. As your best man, trust me, it's not about the style, it's about the fit. When you're out there on the dance floor, you don't want any restrictions, okay? Let's test these babies out one more time.	I don't know why Carla wants me to wear a cummerbund, let alone a red one.
It _is_ hot!	Okay, ready? Five, six, seven, eight.And one, two, three, four, five six, seven, eight.
I can't reach!	Put one hand on the floor!
I can feel it burning!	You better feel the burn!
Well, we grew up in ...	Where I grew up, they didn't allow two men to marry.
...There you gotta do things like test suits out...	Well, shoot, I grew up in the 'hood ...
Uh.... I'm the best man. Do you have any advice for me to give my friend?	...That's right.I'ma go change.
Yeah, I'll make sure and do that.	Just remind him over and over that the wedding is all about what the woman wants.
It's got to be one of these!Oh, I've got ideas.	You got the ring?
One one thousand, two one thousand.... And now I'm best at that!	How about best at not talking?
Me or him?	Hey!
What now?	Cool.
No, why?	Did you tell anybody about my epiphany toilet?
First of all, why would I tell anyone? And secondly, no one has epiphanies on the john!	If I find out you told anybody, I'm gonna beat you with poppy's old nickel sock.
When two people collide, a lot of things can happen.	Aye-aye, captain.Dice medigo...
For some it can be disaster.	Oh, hey, Bob. Great news: we found Hector a room!
Still, the weirdest thing is when two people collide without ever being in the same room.	I know!!! ...Um... I know.
Just paint your legs black, you'll be fine.	Dude! I look like I'm going to Ferrakhan day-camp!
You know what? You should totally say something. You know, unless you want to set a precedent where she's walking all over you for the rest of your life; but it's your call, you might love that, I don't know.	Just remind him over and over that the wedding is all about what the woman wants.
Well, I better get to work before all the good patients are taken.	I don't know....
AGH!	J.D., can I talk to you?
Phew! False alarm.	Have you seen Carla around?
AGH!	'Cause I need to, uh, talk to you in private? Sort of man to man?
I can't right now, Turk. I am completely swamped.	AGH!
So I can get to my patients faster.	You're drawing lightning bolts on your Nikes.
Later's no good, dude. I gotta stop by the tux shop, then I gotta finish telling my whole family that you picked me as your best man!	How 'bout later?
Dr. Casey! Have you seen Turk?	...Kevin Casey.
You should see us gettin' down when we try pants on together.	Oh, yeah, nice guy...good surgeon...great dancer.
Cool. I'll see you tomorrow.	Yeah-heh. I have to go.
Why? Why do you have to do that?	Uh, actually, no. I got a call I have to go back to my hospital.
I know.	Well, look at it this way: Uh, I may be leaving here, but I will always be there.
Ha, I know.... Okay. Well, sir, it was amazing to work with you.	I am so messing with you.
Okay, sorry.	Thank you.And that's three seconds!
Watching Kevin go, I wondered how gay I looked giving that two-handed handshake. And also how weird it was that someone could just walk into your life, have such a big impact, and then vanish just like that, never to be seen again.But mostly I thought about how, in some small way, Kevin had helped every single person he met here.	Okay.
Elliot, he didn't say goodbye to a lot of people. Just me, Dr. Cox, Carla, Doug, Snoop Dogg Intern...	Kevin left. Didn't even say goodbye.
I haven't seen them.	Where my hos at?
He didn't help a lot of people, Elliot. It was just me, and Turk, and Carla, and Dr. Cox, and Doug, and Dr. Mickhead	Look, I don't wanna sound pathetic, but, he didn't even help me.
_Was_ in rehab, Elliot. Was. He'll never huff paint again.	Mickhead? No, Mickhead's in rehab.
There's Turk. I gotta go.	All right, see, with intubating....I can't seem to intubate patien
Yeah, me too.	With Marbury, I really believe New York has a shot at the title, man.
I wanna say tennis....	Which sport are we talking about?
It's always uncomfortable when two guys wanna say something each other.	The only reason I asked my brother to be best man was because I knew he couldn't come to the wedding. But now his plans have changed and he's all excited. Dude, it has to be you, you know that.
Look, you've been my best friend for ten years, man; I've loved you since college, and you know I'd do anything for you.	It's always uncomfortable when two guys wanna say something each other.
Solid.You know, if it makes it easier, I guess we could be co-best men.	Dude, look, man, you're my friend and I frickin' love you; and no one's looked out for me like you have.Cool.
...Even though...God said it's supposed to be one....	You have no idea how much stress that would relieve.
I can't believe it's gone.	You see, this is why I wanted you to use the bathroom up here.If there's something you know you can do, whether it's intubating a patient or...copping a squat on the roof, and your mind keeps throwing up roadblocks, just know you can drive right through 'em.
I think it's human nature to search for answers.	I can't believe it's gone.
No reason.	Dude. Why is your tux gonna cost four thousand dollars?
Sometimes the answer you get is the one you least expect.	No reason.
But more often than not, the answers we've been looking for have been inside us all along.	Dairy Queen!
I guess the important thing is to never stop searching.	Well done, there, Barbie. You're now exactly where you were three years ago.
I'll help you. Nah. Okay.	Occupied!
Let's have the other foot.	Oh. That feels so good. Right there. Yeah.
I'm a doctor. This has been in people.	Elliot. I'm a surgeon. I cut people open.
Well, I think the obvious answer is to draw Sean's face on it and tell him you grew it	Sean's coming back in a few weeks. What am I supposed to
Dammit.	Cut me the hell up.
You okay?	Turk! Wait! Turk! Turk! Whoa!
Will there be a piñata? Because I need to know if I should bring my piñata helmet.	How about a Russian Roulette booth? And here's the kicker. We put bullets in ALL the
It was a gift.	Hup-pah-bah! Would you zip it, nerd? The only reason I invited you is
From me to me.	It was a gift.
Why not?	Anyhoo. I'm thinking that you probably shouldn't come.

Why is that?Waaaauuuuuuuuuuuuuuggggghhhhhhhhhhhh!	Oh yeah. He always has to make some grand entrance that he just winds up depressed

I need to get it started first.	Not a strong moment for you, Polly.
Is this thing made of Teflon?	Uh-huh.
I have to get going.	You know something? You have slept with both of my sisters. That means you
Oh my God! He's gonna die!	So should I be worried about the old ticker?
Dr. Cox, I can't. I'm already covering for Doug. He's on a His-and-Her Spa Day withDon't ask. The point is, I'm swamped. And I'm a little worried about Mr. Taylor here.Mr. Taylor.	Only me. Long story short, your new job is to take young Ben here by the hand and
For the life of me, I can't figure out his irregular heartbeat.	Hiiiiii.
Would you please stop it.	Hey, J.D. My sister Danni is more of a gentle kisser, don't you think? But I find
So you would be a butt-face.	All right. I'll scrap it away and we'll cover it with skin from the
God, how long does it	No, it wouldn't.
Dr. Cox.	That hurt here,
Twenty minutes after you left, he went into cardiac arrest.	What's the matter with you there,
Guilt's a funny thing. It can lead to denial.	This shouldn't have happened.
Guilt can lead to compromise.	Darn kid!
But as a doctor, you are around death so much, you get used to the guilt. And	Dammit.
I'm on call tonight.	What are you still doing here?
So wait. You think this was my fault?	Not anymore. I'm taking all your patients.
Dr. Cox. Can I talk to you for a second?Look. You want to be mad at me, that's fine. I get it. Okay. But Jordan called. And	Aw. Why are you here?
I can't, man. I got things to do.	I know, but...Listen. My butt is fabulous. A slice of that up here,
What? They're my shower shorts.	You got to forgive him.
You know, you're right. I was an idiot to buy these shower shorts. I mean, it's not like	Those are the most ridiculous things I have ever seen.
Thanks. I really needed to hear that.	Look, I just want to say. That what happened. Wasn't your fault. And I'm

Jordan's best friends came to town for the funeral, and unfortunately for Dr. Cox, they still haven't left.	Why?
Dr. Kelso was having a little female trouble of his own.	Oh, God.
Every time Turk's in a hurry, I'm always tempted to jump out and scare him. Well, today's the day!	I'll handle this. I think what Garfunkle here is trying to say is that you should all take a second, think seriously about what's really bothering you, and then have a big group unbunching of your panties.
Booga! Booga! Booga! Booga!Wooo! Ack!	Every time Turk's in a hurry, I'm always tempted to jump out and scare him. Well, today's the day!
The...reason Turk's in such a rush is because he's starting a rotation with the hospital's new attending surgeon.	Booga! Booga! Booga! Booga!Wooo! Ack!
I could tell what the guys were thinking.	So.... You guys my new residents?
Well, it would be "queen" if I took my "cwothes" off it.	Hey, I've been sharing a guest room with razor-knees, here, for the last two weeks. Do you have a queen bed?
May I be excused?	Oh.
You know, down the street on the right, they'll make an appletini that'll knock your socks off.	Where can one get a nice gin and tonic?
So, uh, Jordan seems to be doing pretty well.	Right! Let's go and get drunk before pilates!
How 'bout you? How you holding up?I...I know it's been kind of tough with Ben dying.Are you gonna talk ever?	You know Jordan, she is a rock.
That's a beautiful sentiment.	Let me go ahead and tee this up for you, there, Annika: We are all going to die someday. For the lucky few of us it'll be nice and fast. But for most of us it'll be just as long and slow and painful as a conversation with you.
I wrote Dear Abby once in seventh grade 'cause I didn't have body hair like the other guys? By the time her response came out in Parade magazine, it was like a forest down there. Well, you know, "nothing ventured..."	Oh, my God. Look, Abby, I didn't write to you asking for help. So, if you continue on down this road, you're going to end up eating, breathing, and relieving yourself through a tube of some kind. Signed, Dealing With It On His Own in Kansas.
Hmmm.... I should probably go to his place....	Looking for streamers and a and a marching band, because this will be the ceremonial one-millionth time I've had to shake off something that you've said.Ahh. Yes, Newbie, I'm having a tough day. And of course I'd love to head home, but Jordan's satanic brood has taken over my apartment and no man in his right mind would dare enter that place.
Uhhh, um.	Just a second, darling.
Ohh, yes.	Does this bra make my boobs look real?
No, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no switchies. I think we should all be happy with the bras God gave us! I really should go.	Damn. Let's switch.
Uhh....I guess I could hang for a smidge.	Or you could just give us a work-out right here.
You know...ladies...I'm not usually into the rough stuff, but.... Oooooh.You shall not feast on me!	How dare you tell us to leave our best friend's house because you want to kiss Perry's ass.
Sometimes it seems like men and women speak a completely different language.	You know what's worse than the basic knuckle-dragging scalpel jocks I usually work with? You. You are the worst kind of sexist. You're one of the sneaky ones who prides himself on saying all the right things when, deep down, what you really think is that I'm just a little girl who needs protecting.
And when that happens, even the best of intentions can be misunderstood.	Great stuff.
Oh, God.	Huh.
And misunderstandings, well, they can lead to disaster.	Oh, God.
Actually, yes. I caught the matinee of that show; definitely not for the whole family.	May I ask you something, there, Judy? Do you have any idea what it's like to have three angry, under-fed women tear you several new ones for a full hour?
Well, you wouldn't see my face because it would be buried in your chest, giving you the hug you've been afraid to ask for your whole life!	Then for the last time, don't stick any part of your hairless body into my business. Trust me, there is nothing for you to gain from it. Because even if you went on a cruise to the most remote regions of the ocean and rescued my drowning, salt-soaked body in time to pump the sea water out of my lungs and bring me back from the brink of death, I would STILL be upset that the first face I saw was yours!
Now, if you don't want my help, then fine, I'll back off.... But only because I feel a little bit guilty.	Huh!
Aaaaaaaaagggggggghhhhhhh!	Dr. Reid! I've seen you strutting around this place with your can-do attitude, and I know that you think because you're a female doctor, you're part of the solution. But you're not. Everything about you screams, "What does the cutie in Radiology think about me?" And yes, your friend Dr. Turk, he may ask you relationship advice or where to get his unfortunate girlfriend some naughty lingerie because we both know that when it comes to gifts, women all crave a nice leather push-up bra with tassels that go around and around and around like this but still, I ask you, is that _respect_?Uh, don't answer. I don't care!
Yes! He fell! I'm gonna get away!	Move, Barbie! Move! Barbie!
Ook! Waaagh!	Yes! He fell! I'm gonna get away!
Ack!	Like you read about.Come here, you.
Well, uh....	Come on!
Dr. Cox had nothing to do with me going to see your scary friends. I did it all on my own.	Spill.
You okay?	Fine. You want some straight shootin'? I'm glad that you're dealing with Ben's death so well. The fact is I'm strugglin'. And having those two harpies nesting in our home is not helping. For the life of me, Jordan, I cannot figure out why they're still here. It is beyond me!
Oh, oka that's going in the box. Girl's names are out. That's why we have a box.	Why don't you grow a pair, Sally!
At that moment, Dr. Cox knew why Jordan's friends were still around.	Well, then you should try stepping into our shoes! Even the strongest women walk around with this thick coat of armor all day long, because God forbid we should show the slightest sign of weakness. So just squeeze those smelly, oversized feet into the shoes of someone you really care about; and trust me, in a heartbeat you will know the right thing to do.
There will always be a battle for power between the sexes.Sometimes a man just has to give in.	Yes. Why don't we.
Other times it's enough just to take a positive step.And once in a while, even it seems cliché, a man just has to be there for her.	Okay.
I couldn't help but think two things. First, I do look stunning in these navy scrubs I mean, come on, who wants a taste? Second, everyone's day begins differently around here.The surgeons for instance are the most superstitious bunch. So they always start their mornings with an oddly homo-erotic ass slap...	Exactly! And who in God's name wants to hear that every day?! "Good morning." In the immortal words of Daffy Duck: I demand that you shoot me now.If only.
...and then their own personal good luck rituals.	Dude! Too deep!
Why don't you just use Power Rangers?	Ohhh, where's my lucky Tabasco 'do-rag!?
You remember when communications with Zordon went down and the Megazord was destroyed?	How are Power Rangers as lucky as Tabasco?
Power Rangers, hoooaaa!	How did I miss that episode? Ohh, that's right I was making love to a woman.
All you can really hope is that nothing bites you on the ass.	Power Rangers, hoooaaa!
Are you counting the boil you lanced yesterday?	Since I been wearing that Tabasco 'do-rag, my surgery record's like 23 and 0.
So why don't you just take off your underwear?	Question: Did he die? Answer: No, he did not. The point is, I gotta stick with whatever's hot. Like last month, it was not wearing any underwear.
Todd knows about the underwear thing?	That's what I keep telling him!
Powerful, tiny fists....	I felt it!
He's back.	Hm!
What I believe is that the most minor event even a butterfly flapping its wings can affect everything.	I need my lucky 'do-rag!
Because once that seemingly insignificant event happens....	Hillside landing.
...It sets everything else in motion.	Baby, I wasn't looking at her lovelies. Okay? I was looking at the butterfly that just happened to _land_ on her lovelies. And who could blame it? There they are, all snuggly and safe and whatnot....
Uncomfortable!	...It sets everything else in motion.
She did it!	Okay, who do I kill?
And insignificant events can lead to significant events.Like me being on time and Dr. Cox being late for a change.	I would love to, Darlin', but I'm a little bit busy right now.
Uh-oh. You've gotta cover for him.	Where the hell is Dr. Cox? His shift started four minutes ago!
Have to learn to play the banjo.	Uh-oh. You've gotta cover for him.
Yes, sir!	Dammit, son, are you listening to me?
And _buy_ a banjo.	Yes, sir!
And here he is!	Hey, fellas. What'd I miss?
Uh, Dr. Kelso? That's my pen.	You know, Perry, since Dr. Dorian was on time and you were busy in the break room coming up with that hilarious "better-worse" bit, maybe you should answer to him all day.
Well, I'm a lefty.	Nice grab.
It's your show, Debbie. Is this moment just like you always pictured?Stupid homemade dolls....It's a little bigger...?	You know, my head's probably going to melt when I say this but Kelso's idea wasn't half bad. Letting you run this place for a day would be a great educational experience. And, come on, let's face facts the training bra's got to come off eventually. So, it's your show, Debbie. Is this moment just the way you always pictured it?
Sounds to me like a G.I. bleed.	Yes. Yes, you are. Fortunately, though, your vitals are normal, so we'll check back with you in a little while.
Come on...you can do this. Navy scrubs! Navy scrubs! Navy scrubs!	Sounds to me like angina.
Hhhheeeere's the deal, Eleanor: We're gonna go ahead and get a full work-up on this guy. So, while I drop an NG tube and do a gastric lavage, why don't you go ahead and get an order on EKG with cardio biomarkers. If you need to know where those are, they're on page 37 of the Ann Taylor catalog right next to that salmon cable-knit sweater you've wanted for so long but haven't had the courage to order...'cause you're worried the weave's so thin, your nipples might just go ahead and peek their little pink selves through. Isn't that right, Dr. Cox....Dr. Cox...	Come on...you can do this. Navy scrubs! Navy scrubs! Navy scrubs!
I don't like candy bracelets.	Oh, I-I-I'm sorry. Here I was in my own little world, talking to myself and dreaming about candy bracelets.
I love them!Now you gotta grab that elevator. But not without giving him his patented shoulder bump!	I don't like candy bracelets.
Good day.OW!How you like me now?	I love them!Now you gotta grab that elevator. But not without giving him his patented shoulder bump!
Oh, I think I know her! Does she have blonde hair?	Nope. But I had the pleasure of meeting Helen, the laundry room lady.
Brown hair?	No.
No hair!	Y-nuh-uh.
Yeah, that's from the dryers.Hey! You know, the janitor's still downstairs. Why don't we just check his custodial closet?	That's the one.
Randall?!	'Sup.
So that's why he's been back in my dreams....	Just got the job, brah.
Gotta go.	Beat it.
You'd be surprised how when one thing goes wrong around here, everything seems to go wrong.	You forgot. You never pay attention to the little things that are important to me.
What happened?	You'd be surprised how when one thing goes wrong around here, everything seems to go wrong.
I don't get it, he wasn't showing any signs of distress!	No pulse in lower extremities.
Uh...let's get him a CT angiogram stat.	Come on, come on, come on! We gotta make a decision here.
Call surgery. Tell 'em we're on our way.	Good.It's an aortic dissection. It's bad.
In a hospital, it's hard to avoid letting people down.Whether it's someone you made a promise to...	Call surgery. Tell 'em we're on our way.
...or someone you love...	Let's go, Gandhi! You're on!
...or even letting down someone you barely knew at all.In the end, it's the "what ifs" that hurt the most. Like, what if things had gone a little differently?	Turk, I'm sorry!
Me, I don't believe in fate. I believe we have more control than we think, and that every action has a reaction. After all....The most minor event even a butterfly flapping its wings can change everything. Sometimes for the better. Even if it doesn't seem like it at first.	Lookit, it's just that aortic dissections are a doctor's worst nightmare. If you don't catch 'em early, there's about a ninety percent mortality rate. I mean, honestly, unless your patient was lucky enough to trip and fall into a CAT-scan machine, he wasn't gonna have a happy ending. Newbie, we didn't have a chance on this one.
I can't.	Look away.
Mmmm! Orange Goo Goo!	Kssshhh!
Heh. So charming. Could you be half as nice to me as you are to her?	I'm blushing.
Fresh start.	You are right. We need a fresh start. Come on.
How long do ya...suppose this'll be?	Mm-hmm.I think we need a longer fresh start.
And insignificant events can lead to significant events.Like me being late because I was in the world's longest handshake.	Probably ten minutes.Ease into it. Let's mix it up let's saw some wood. There we go. Nice. Very good.
Sorry I'm late. What'd I miss?	And insignificant events can lead to significant events.Like me being late because I was in the world's longest handshake.
I should get Turk a washboard!	Take a wild guess.
Uh, Dr. Kelso? That's my pen.	Maybe so, but I started those things promptly at 8.
I'm a righty.	Nice grab.
Sounds to me like a G.I. bleed.	Yes. Yes, you are. Fortunately, though, your vitals are normal, so we'll check back with you in a little while.
Whatever. Just avoid the shoulder bump, catch the elevator, and make a great wise-ass remark before the doors close!	Look, Newbie, if you go ahead and leave this hospital knowing only one thing and God save me, it looks like there's a real chance that might happen please let this be that one thing: I'm in charge, and I don't care about your opinion. Now go get me a cup of coffee.
Hoohoo, hey, Dr. Cox, if you're so smart, maybe you should just...go ahead and be the...you're the kind of......Oh, dammit!I don't know what happened there. I'm usually quick and funny....	Whatever. Just avoid the shoulder bump, catch the elevator, and make a great wise-ass remark before the doors close!
Have you ever noticed that words that rhyme with "bowel" are always bad? Like "scowl", "growl"..."movies with Andie MacDowell"....	Mm.
Stop.	You're right, J.D. You are funny.
Ischemic bowel! That's it!	Stop.
You'd be surprised how when one thing goes right around here, everything seems to go right.	Ah.
Look, Dr. Cox, I know my opinion doesn't mean anything and I'm always wrong and apparently useless which deep down you know isn't true because... ...shoot, I forgot your coffee. Anyway, I was thinking we should get a CT scan on Mr. Strauss, because he might have bowel ischemia.	You'd be surprised how when one thing goes right around here, everything seems to go right.
All right.It doesn't look like he's ischemic.	You know what, what the hell. It can't hurt. Let's get on it.
In a hospital, it's great when you get to come through for someone.	That's very good. Laverne, will you call the O.R. and have it prepped?
Of course, it still doesn't always work out the way you'd hope.	Clamp.
In the end, you learn to treasure the times when things go your way.	Rachel, clean up.
And be there for the ones you love when they don't.And most importantly, you learn to accept that some things are out of your hands.	So glad you're okay!
Yeah....	Didn't matter when we caught it, Newbie. It was just his time.
But still, with so much of life left up to chance, you can't help but look back and wonder.... What if things had been different...?	Yeah....
That means "good morning"!	Morning!
Enough beads! No more flashing.	Oooh.Come on!!!!
Fine.	More beads, dammit! Come on!
Only because Jasper becomes an innie when he gets nervous....Still	Sounds pretty embarrassing.
Of course, not all relationships are as solid as Carla's and mine.	Only because Jasper becomes an innie when he gets nervous....Still
Latah!That means "I'll be seeing you later."	I gotta give Mr. Ingram his meds so, latah!
How else am I supposed to know?	You want my fiancée? Just go ahead and take her, 'cause she's been nagging the crap outta me. "Pick up your socks. Wash your dishes. Stop whispering 'booya' to J.D. in the morning after we have sex."
Ooooooh! That ass warrants the Batman sound effects loop!	I'm sayin'!
ZAP!	POW!
Tushie parts?	Turk, how come every time I turn around you're checking out some woman's you-know-what?
That means "now she all maaad."	Thanks for having my back.Babe.
Sometimes a new face will just outright surprise you.	So, if any of you are interested in following in the philanthropic footsteps of Dr. Ramirez, he has graciously offered to answer any of your questions.I told you no one would care.
I think he gets bored.	Why is he doing that?
And yet the salads always suffer....	It's good, isn't it? That's because every time Estelle's working, she puts extra croutons into the stuffing.
Kudos on the nice pooper.	Hi!
Mine's firm, like mutton.	...Thank you...
Please say you heard.	You didn't hear what happened?
Damn you, Ron!	No, I didn't!
Nooooo!	Steve took a year off to take care of his parents, and while he was gone, Sherry starting seeing Dr. Harding.
Nooooo!	Sherry and Gary?
Oh, thank God!You know, 'cause they...they both died doing what they loved.... Rafting.	Yes!
Every minute of every day.	When do you think of this stuff?
I don't know.... Can I press yours?Not always harmless.	Can I press your button?
It's always a risk when you go out on a limb. Ultimately, you just make yourself vulnerable.	Hey! Uh, Carla.... I was, uh, wondering if...you wanted to grab dinner with me tonight.
And you just hate to see anyone get crushed. ...Even Dr. Hot Butt.	So what do you say?
I'm sorry, what?	Sure! That sounds great!
Shame!	I don't know! He asked me out to dinner and I said yes! It just came out!
"Ronnie"?	Look! Everyone thinks it's just guys who get all freaked out before the wedding, but it happens to women too!
Now I want you to go.	"Ron." Ron he's not just some guy, J.D. He's my "what if?" guy. The one I always wondered about, the one I idealized, you know?
That she's a sorceress!	Now I want you to go.
Then you won't mind if I tell Turk!	Look, I would never do anything inappropriate.
Damn beads....	If you have to, go ahead. But! Then I'll know that we're not as close as I thought!
Uncool!	Ooh! Lemon zinger!
...What you'd look like if you were Chinese...?	What were you thinking about?
Hoo! That was lucky!	Me too!
Sometimes around here you can't believe what you're seeing......Other times it's as clear as day.	And that, boys, is a brotherly handshake.
AGGH!	Hey!
I got lots of time to talk. Do you wanna talk about anything? Anything? Hours to talk. We could talk about our feelings. Wh-what's up?	You got a minute to talk?
Well, I wouldn't put it that way in your vows.... Hand me that?	So I'm supposed to marry someone who's gonna bust my chops every time I look at a woman for the rest of my life?
I hear they're coming out with a 'Stuart Little 3'.	Nag! Nag! Nag! Nag! You see how Carla is lately. I mean, is that all I have to look forward to?
Turk, don't you have any work to do?	Nah, it's on hold. The director dropped out.
Beads, keep me strong!	Dude. Surgeon.
Nothing.	What?
Awww, that's great. She's gonna go Wait, what?	I'm gonna go tell Turk.
Whatever you do, don't scream.	Whoooa!
I don't know. People always said that in the movies.	Why would I scream?
Well, that's up to you, isn't it! Gotta go!	But still, what if I want to tell him?
It's hard when you lose for the first time.It's even harder when it's the hundredth time.	Hell, no! You lost! Live with it!
And yet sometimes losing is a good thing.Like, for instance, when you lose your insecurities about the guy you're marrying, which makes it a whole lot easier to cut him some slack once in a while.	What, give up my front-row seat to Barbie's Wild Ride? "He's a drug addict! He's not a drug addict! You make me doubt my self!"You're more interested in being right than doing what's right! And I just couldn't take it! Can't take it anymore!"
I guess you can never underestimate how the smallest gesture can make everything better.	Yeah. Besides, you're cutting up your napkin.
You know, for a minute there I actually thought you had a twin brother.	I guess you can never underestimate how the smallest gesture can make everything better.
Mm.	Really?
Stop it.	Was it when my twin brother was here?
Things Jordan says during sex! Ha!	We're four seconds in and I'm already regretting my decision.
Noooo. They're the charts you wanted, plus! patient history charts from the last ten years, which yours truly stayed up all night organizing not only chronologically but by severity of condition.There's a good chance I'm gonna kill someone.	Are those the charts I wanted?
Clever.	Things you say when you talk to your patients.
No, but wait!I already got my shifts covered for the next two days! Besides, where're you gonna find somebody else? You think Lonnie, my intern, gives a rat's ass about acute thomrobotic thrombocytopenic purpura?	Ah, don't bother with that, Trish. You know, I've been getting my hair cut by my barber, Big Frank, for seventeen years now. Is it because his prices remained the same? No. Is it because I like the way his man-breasts feel gently resting on my shoulders when he does my sideburns? A little, yes. But, mainly, it's because, unlike you, he does just exactly what I tell him to do. You see, it's my way or the highway, and since you've already broken that dictum you're out!
Kiss ass.	It is gonna be so amazing working on the disease that tore my family apart.
I guess I could go home.... But there's plenty of important stuff I need to do around here.	Kiss ass.
Hey, Laverne. What'd you give me if I get this jelly bean into your cleavage?	I guess I could go home.... But there's plenty of important stuff I need to do around here.
You got the fellowship?	Guys! Three long years of busting my hump at this place and it has finally paid off!
Aaaagggghhhh!	Oh, no he didn't.
Not worth it.	Haaaaah!
Come on, don't get mad at Turk. What's really bugging me is that, thanks to Dr. Cox, I've got nothing to do...nothing to talk about...no stories to tell.	Fine. Don't lick 'em.
Ooh, you know, if it helps, I could I could examine her...for you. Elliot, please!Ow! It hurt through my helmet!	Meanwhile, back in adult world.... I was just given twelve new admits and now there's no way that I can be a clown for the kids today!
I don't know the exact distance in terms of feet and inches, but in laymen's terms, I would have to say...about halfway.	Okay, okay, okay.
Ow!	I don't know, sir.
Owwww.	Ah, ba da ba.
Dr. Reid couldn't be here today, children, so I'm here in her place.	Kurt was the one that was always there for me. And at the end of the day, that's who you want the guy who shows up when you need him, without having to ask.
Well, Brad, I'm the type of clown that likes to wear tight pants.	Why're your pants so tight? Clowns have baggy pants!
What other clown?	But the other clown has baggy pants!
Janitor!	Hello, old friend.
Save it for the post-show, Lurch.I think what Angry, Disturbed Clown is trying to teach us is that it's never funny to push!	You're a horrible clown.
Okay, let's take a little break, kids. Duck, Duck, Eel.	Dr. Dorian?
So you steal my research project and now you want me to do your dirty work?	Mr. Millican just died, and his family needs to be notified. Since I'm still kind of new at this, I was hoping you could do it.
Unfortunately your grandfather's bowel burst, causing a severe sepsis. We were unable to save him. I'm so sorry.Again, I'm...I'm very sorry.	You're just upset because it's never easy to give someone bad news.
Oh, just breaking some bad news...circus style.	J.D., what are you doing?
The show must go on.	Break's over, Binky.
You did it!	It's weird. Just by the simple act of pushing me to do the right thing, I remembered why Carla's the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with.End of story.
Oh, man, what a long day.Still, any day can be salvaged by drinking a few cold ones with a good friend.	You did it!
Elliot, The Judge, please.	Mm.You still have a little clown makeup on you!
What the hell is she doing? It's The Judge!Oh.	Fine, I'll get it.
I can't find the clasp.	What the hell is she doing? It's The Judge!Oh.
The clasp! The clasp!	What?
Naughty!	I switched to frontsies!
We only had two.	Position One, Two, or Three?
It's a mystery how one woman can drive you crazy over and over again.While another can bring you right back down to earth.In the end, you have to trust that the perfect woman will always lead you in the right direction.	Oh, yeah. Well, I have something to show you later.
Look, Elliot, I don't want to jinx this, but, how did that just happen?	So did you ever get the guts to mail the invitations?
Sean?	You were a clown for me. You were there when I needed you without me even having to ask.
You be.She's already back with Sean.	Dude, ignore her. That's three years in a row who's feeling you?
About ninety seconds.	How soon after you guys hooked up?
What should I do?	Oooooh.
That was a huge mistake. Because the closer Turk and Carla got to their wedding, the more they became one of those annoying couples that thought they knew everything about relationships.	What should I do?
The phone call was Elliot asking me to meet her so we could talk.	Mmm.
Irrrrrv!	The phone call was Elliot asking me to meet her so we could talk.
Ehp-ehp-ehp! You look great, Irv!	I've been trying like the dickens to cut down on my snacking, but it's just so
Irv didn't look great, but I didn't have time to talk.	Ehp-ehp-ehp! You look great, Irv!
Danni!?	Irv didn't look great, but I didn't have time to talk.
When you run into someone you used to date, either you find them totally annoying or enough time has passed that you've idealized everything about them.	Danni!?
"Hey, Jay-Dee!"	Hey, J.D.
I'm actually on my way to see somebody, so, you know....	"Hey, Jay-Dee!"
Oh, be nice.	Oh, okay. I'll see you later.
Danni, wait!How've you been?	Oh, be nice.
Ooh! Gotta go!	Well, actually, I
And there she was my lady.	Ooh! Gotta go!
Hey, Elliot.	And there she was my lady.
Should we just hold each other?	J.D., I can't talk right now.
What's up....Attention, Sacred Heart! Everyone please gather 'round. Doctors, nurses, patients, hear ye, hear ye.Everyone should know that last night, Elliot Reid and I made passionate love for a good hour and a half. Check that! A _great_ hour and a half.When I hit it, I hit it good! That is all!	Sorry! Sorry! I couldn't find a parking spot! Heh.Hey, J.D. What's up?
The love of my life.	What?
You got it.	The love of my life.
Peace out, Sean.	Bye, J.D.
I know. I mean, you don't want to be rusty at sex before you throw down with your real boyfriend, do ya?	Listen, J.D.... Last night was really important to me.
I totally understand. You know, Danni and I are getting back together, too.	Look, you and I have been down this road before and we both know where it ends.
We are?	I totally understand. You know, Danni and I are getting back together, too.
Damn! I should know this!	Danni? Danni, Danni, Danni.... What was her last name?
Yes! Raspy voice!	Blonde hair!
And during. God, you never used to smoke!	What? I like smoking after sex.
Oh, I don't know, Danni. The real me's not really into that.	Yeah, but back then I was pretending to be someone I thought you wanted me to be, and that didn't work. So now.......I'm gonna let the real me come out. And the real me wants to do it again...and she wants to do it rough!
Oh, my God, Danni, I am so sorry. I thought that's what you wanted.	GIVE IT TO ME!
YAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!	It was.
Oh, no, no. I was I was in there with my buddy Danny, from the gym.	Bambi! We know you were in there with Danni. We heard you say her name!
He's a...really...good...buddy.	But we heard you say "Take it all, Danni!"
Look, maybe Danni's not the love of my life, all right? But she's she's beautiful, and she quirky, and she's very...sweet.	And WoJo's commentary on it? Priceless!
Barbara's my mom.	Man, I get so gassy after having sex.Oh, by the way, some skank named Barbara called, and I told her to back off.
In life, there are personal realizations....	Barbara's my mom.
I hate my girlfriend.	In life, there are personal realizations....
....and professional ones.	I hate my girlfriend.
But the worst are the realizations that sneak up on you.	Listen, Serpico, I go four steps out that door to my car every day. And that's important, because if I don't beat Enid home from her thighs & buns class, I have to help her peel off her leotard. So remember this: I hired you, and I can fire you.
Like when you realize you just might have a crush after all.	Oh, oh, you are so annoying; you must drive your wife insane. ...Are you married?
Oh, uh, tell her I'm not here.	Hey, Q-Tip! Some girl who says she's your girlfriend is on the phone!
Great! Have fun, I'll be over here.	Sure!
"Enjoy" is such a strong word.... I...I'm used to it. You know, like cafeteria food, or the constant threat of terrorism.	Do you even enjoy spending time with me?
Last night in bed, I knocked you unconscious!	Not really. I'm more into tough guys, you know?
So I guess...this is over.	For like _five seconds_!
So, you'd rather hang out with someone you don't even like than be alone?	Why?
Yeah, me too. I mean, come on, how many couples out there actually have fun together?	Yeah, pretty much.
Yeah, he'sWhere'd he go?	Ninety-nine! One hundred! Have you guys seen Sean?
Aw, he's a dynamite hider.	Yeah, he'sWhere'd he go?
Okay, sort away, Seany-Sean-Sean!Oh, my God!How could you do this to me?	We're both good-looking guys, am I right? We'll sort this out when I get back!
Ohh, I don't know! Come over my house, sleep with me, and then dump me the minute Sean shows up so I feel like a complete loser!	Do...what?
You know I only have one set.	Oh, you seem real crushed! I mean, you jumped into bed with Danni so quick you didn't have time to change the sheets!
Could I ask you one?	Look, J.D., can I ask you a favor?
Damn, I don't have one.	Sure, anything. What is it?
Look, Elliot! What do you want!?	Didn't have one, did ya?
I was so mad at Elliot I couldn't sleep last night. Also, Danni snores like a gutted wild boar. But mostly it was the Elliot thing.	Oh. Here's your chance!
Good.	Hey, J.D. Can I talk to you for a sec?Look, things have been a little weird between Elliot and I since I got back.
Sorry, everybody. False alarm.	J.D., listen. Did anything happen between you and Elliot while I was gone?
There comes a time when every man has to make a choice. Whether it's a professional choice...	Well?
Or whether it's a personal choice.	Come on! What are you gonna do about it?
In the end, it's about integrity.	Hey. Wanna go for a beer after the show?
And it's about chasing after what you really want.	No!
Even if that means showing you both care a little.	Here's your beer.
And sometimes...well, sometimes you just have to do what's right for your friend.	Cheers.
No. Sean, nothing happened.	And sometimes...well, sometimes you just have to do what's right for your friend.
Even if it means sacrificing your own happiness.	Hey.
When it comes down to it, you just have to be proud of the decision you make.	Giddyup, Dr. Dorkian!
Me, I was stuck at a couples-only dinner party. There were the soon-to-be newlyweds....There were the girl that I loved and the guy trying to eat her face....And then there's Danni....	Did that just happen? Anybody?
Nobody cares, Danni.	You know what I was thinking?
Hey, Turk! Where're you guys gonna live after you get married?	Oh, please.
Guess it's just the two of us.	Baby, not now. Don't know yet!
I guess.	You wanna have sex?
Please don't.	Do I have to look at you?
Turk didn't realize that everyone has their moments when emotions run high.	No, Carla's not the "freak out" type.
Turk!	Oh, Danni!
Danni!	Kelso!
Not here.	Carla!?
Keep it.Dude, Danni did the weirdest thing last night she called out her own name during sex.	I'm gonna go put some clothes on. After all, I am a lady.Oh, by the way, I used your razor to shave my pits.
Because she hears like a bat.	That is weird. Why are we whispering?
Yeah, 'cause they can't see.	Bats hear really well?
No, no, no, no, no. Bats and whales, bats and whales!	Oh, yeah, that's right, sonar. Wait a second, that's whales!
Anyway, I have to break up with her.	Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, just let her down easy.	Anyway, I have to break up with her.
Danni, I'm not sure how to do this but, uh...I just don't think we should see each other anymore.	Okay, just let her down easy.
You know what! I don't even care, you know why? Because I bet she's calling out my name while she's sleeping with him!	Whoa! I guess she wasn't calling out her own name after all!
See, like a bat, dude! Like a bat!	No, I don't!
Aaaaaaaaagh!	Check.
She seems almost peaceful....	Good morning, world!
Maybe not.	Later, butt-licks!
Oh, just make sure you got all your things out of my bedroom, okay?	Maybe not.
Mmm.	Crunchberry, wrong pipe.
That's not true, is it?	Hey, J.D., don't come chasing after me like you do with Elliot. Because if there's one thing everyone knows about John Dorian, it's that he always wants what he can't have.
That made absolutely no sense, so just keep sipping.	Really, what's his name?
She's quite mad, you know. I hope she doesn't rub off on you.	Thank you. I just calmed her down.
His dad loved doughnuts.	Duncan?
I don't know. Remember back in college, when we had tickets to see Michael Jordan in the playoffs?	That's not true. Okay, you really need to stop saying that. The point is, I don't lose my cool.
Hey, was I supposed to bring the tickets or the sandwiches?Oh, God.	We're goin' to see Michael Jordan! We're goin' to see Michael Jordan! We're goin' to see Michael Jordan! 'Cause we got good tickets! We went five hundred miles
You shaved your head for the first time after that.	OH! NO! Leave it on the floor! You leave it on the floor!
Why are you here? Hospitals don't sell cigarettes!	Wanting what you can't have.
Quiet time, Todd.	Man, I'd smoke her.
Who?	For three years I've been watching you pine after Blonde Doctor, and I gotta tell you, everyone is sick of it "Will they? Won't they? Looks like they're going to! Oooh, the last second, something might oooh oooh oooh!" Come on! Enough already! I mean, you guys aren't exactly Ross and Rachel.
Mmm.	Dr. Ross, and Rachel from Bookkeeping.
You know, I I don't even care what you think.	Why don't you just let her be happy with...stunningly handsome, full-lipped guy.
In the heat of battle, it's important to hold your ground.	You know, I I don't even care what you think.
Because victory can be snatched away at the last second.	Well, now, Bobbo, you hooked him, you got him in the boat, but he still got away!
Sometimes you don't even know how it happened.	Mm-hmm.
Yep, it's amazing how your world can change in an instant.	I un-invited her.
Full-lipped bastard.	That _is_ great! Isn't that great?
Great!	Full-lipped bastard.
So, moving in together, huh?	My mommy said you had lollipops. Gimme a red one!
And just like that I saw my window.	Yeah.... It's a little scary.
It _is_ scary! You know, I knew this girl in college who moved in with her boyfriend? Everything changed stopped talking to each other, started fighting all the time and...you know the rest.	And just like that I saw my window.
Oh, no, he killed her.	They broke up?
Could be you!	Dr. Reid? They need you to check on that stabbing victim in Room 301?
Nothing.	What?
Why are you here, Sean?	Don't do that.
Okay, new rule! Hospitals are for doctors and sick people only! Okay?	It's 'cause he wants what he can't have.
Maybe it's true that I'm someone who only wants what he can't have. But what if the thing I want is the girl I'm supposed to end up with?	Thanks, J.D. I...really needed to hear that from you.
It should be me.	Maybe it's true that I'm someone who only wants what he can't have. But what if the thing I want is the girl I'm supposed to end up with?
Look, Elliot: Every year we bounce around this thing, and I never have the courage to stand up and tell you how I feel. I'm crazy about you. And I want you to know if I had the choice of hanging around with anyone in the entire world or staying at home with you, eating pizza and watching a crappy TV show, I'd choose you every time.	What?
It's amazing how one simple gesture can bring you back from the brink.	You did that for me?
I guess the funny thing about love is you never know how things are gonna work out.Like me. I lost Elliot. But at least I went down swinging.	This isn't gonna work.
Elliot? What are you doing?	I guess the funny thing about love is you never know how things are gonna work out.Like me. I lost Elliot. But at least I went down swinging.
'Little House on the Prairie.'	What are we watching?
Sometimes the smallest victory is enough to get you through the day.	Well, bully for you, there, Bobbo.
As for me, all I needed was Elliot.	I love _you_!
Well, I think you made the right choice.	J.D., it's just so weird. I mean, my whole future was right there in front of me, and I just walked away. All because of you.
I think that the problem with most people who want what they can't have is that, when they actually get the thing they covet, they don't want it anymore. But not this guy.	Well, I think you made the right choice.
Oh, my God! I DON'T WANT HER!	Well, Dr. Dorian, you have me. You finally have me.
An _incredibly_ heavy sleeper.	Ooh! Ooh! Ooog!
Wow.	An _incredibly_ heavy sleeper.
I knew I needed to talk this over with someone who understood me. Someone I had recently been intimate with.	Wow.
Okay, not him.	Yeah?
Please, Larry!What the hell you doing with that guy?	I think I'll go put on some underwear.
He's not a celebrity!	I don't know. I thought it'd be cool to date a celebrity.
Wait a second!	He's not a celebrity!
Are you the Soup Nazi from 'Seinfeld'?	Wait a second!
Say the soup thing.	No.
Dammit!	No!
Look, Danni, the reason I'm here is well, first of all I wanted to give you back your skull lighter.Secondly, you always seem to have some insight in to why I'm so messed up. I mean here I-I chase after Elliot for three years, now I don't want her!	Hey, Marco! The invites said no dates!No da ....
Why would I idealize women?	Well maybe it's 'cause you idealize women and no one can live up to your standards.
I love you, honey. You're the smartest, handsomest, sweetest boy in the whole world. And no matter how hard you look, you will never find a woman who'll love you as much as I do.	What's your mom like?
I know, Mommy.	I love you, honey. You're the smartest, handsomest, sweetest boy in the whole world. And no matter how hard you look, you will never find a woman who'll love you as much as I do.
My mom is perfect.	I know, Mommy.
Hm?	Look, kid, you're just confused. All you need to do is focus on the little things you love about her. Like...the way she puts out a cigarette...or how when she finishes a beer, she looks inside the can just to check if there's any left.
It's 5 to 9?! I gotta go!	Sweetie, it's 5 to 9, and my Denver omelet's not gonna make itself.
Oh, he is so the Soup Nazi! Trick him!	It's 5 to 9?! I gotta go!
What is it again? It's like, you're out of luck in the soup department?	Oh, he is so the Soup Nazi! Trick him!
Ha! Rad.Oooog! Ow!	NO SOUP FOR YOU!
Just lying here, watching you sleep.	What are you doing?
"Nice"? Elliot, these are the hands of a god!	Do you know that you have really nice hands?
Fine, so it's not the self-esteem thing.	Heh!
Then Elliot and I got to witness an event that many had spoken of, but none had ever seen.	Fine, so it's not the self-esteem thing.
Morning!	The arrival of the janitors!
No, I was I was kidding.	Is it? Is it really?
Who won?	I'd stay out of his way today. He just lost the election for union president.
Sociopath!	I'm just saying the next person that gets in my face is gonna wish they hadn't.
Oh! Cool!	Catch me, stud!You know, most guys woulda caught me. I love that you didn't!
Maybe Elliot's just not the right fit for me. I mean, I'm the kinda guy who likes stupid movies.	Oh! Cool!
And I have uncontrollable hostility towards small rodents.	Hey, let's rent 'Kangaroo Jack' tonight!
Dammit, she's perfect on paper! What the hell's wrong with me?	Or we could just go shoot rats at the dump!
What?	Dammit, she's perfect on paper! What the hell's wrong with me?
I guess the Soup Nazi was right, it is the little things that are important.Or how she's the only person I know who sneezes with her eyes open.	Nothing. I just love the way you drift off in your head sometimes.
And that's when I realized that I really liked all those things about Elliot, but I didn't love them...and I didn't love her.	Atchoo. Ahem. 'Scuse me.
Oh, boy.	You're the best.See you later.
Turk, I need your help, man. It's about Elliot.	Chew louder.
How does everybody know about this?You're a very loud chewer.	Why, did you sleep with her again?
So now that you're gettin' married, it's all about you.	Dude, I would love to help right now, but I'm in the middle of writing my vows. And all I've got so far is, "Let's give it up for the caterers! WOO! Good chicken!"
I know!	Ooh, still seems that you can take a minute for a friend.
I was going to stay with her for the rest of my life.	Awesome!
We must eat with them!	So, my parents are coming to town next week.
Hey, Elliot. Thanks for letting me crash at your place while Carla's family's in town for the wedding.	Oh. All right.
And now we live together.	Oh, it's not problem. See ya, roomie.
What the?	And now we live together.
Aaagh!	Sheila!
I can only assume you're saying "Let me out or I'm gonna kill ya" not gonna happen.I know! I know that makes you angry, butUh-oh!Okay! Okay! You know, I'm fine the other way! However you wanna do	Lgh mm ogh rm um ghna kghl ghu!
How can you not remember that time we were with those	God, I can't remember the last time I saw you in this suit and tie.
the two guys, and their mom was trying to sing that song!	Oh, God! With the two guys!
So funny.Till they had to...put their horse down.	It was so funny!
Yeah.	Oh, yeah....He could run like the wind, but his tail couldn't put out that fire.
Boyfriend?	God, we have so much history together. So great to finally be able to call you my boyfriend.
No it's just...it's nice to hear it out loud.	Oh, should I not have said that?
And it was nice. I mean, here I was having my tie tied by this beautiful woman who happened to be one of my closest friends, and I realized that this is what a relationship is supposed to feel like.	No it's just...it's nice to hear it out loud.
Yeah, it is.	There. It's perfect.
Wow. That's a hard act to follow.	I've made a lot of mistakes in my life, but you've managed to erase them all, because each and every one of them has led me to you.
Turk!	Carla, I love that you get cold when it's seventy-one degrees out. I love that it takes you an hour and a half to order a sandwich.I love that you get a little crinkle above your nose when you're looking at me like I'm nuts. Yeah, like you got right now! Just like that one! I love that you're the last person I want to talk to before I go to sleep at night.
Yeah, I decided to stay with her forever.	So I take it you haven't broken up with her yet.
Oh, you know what? If it's okay with you, I'm gonna go ahead and take relationship advice from someone whose fiancee is currently speaking to him. Ohhhh!	That's great, dude. I know you think you're being nice, but I'm pretty sure Elliot doesn't want to spend her life with someone who doesn't love her.
Gimme some champagne! I need a victory sip!	Ohhhh-ho!
Come on, man. Elliot and I are like best friends. We love hanging out with each other. Maybe that's love. I mean, who who knows what love really is?	Cheers.You're making a big mistake.
I hope so.	I do. J.D., when I look at Carla, I see the future. I see kids, I see minivans, I see a beer gut on me, of course, not her.
Turk.	But you know what's really weird? None of that stuff scares me. Not even when
I know. Maybe you should stand up and say that.	Dude, I'm trying to make a point here.
Listening to Turk made me think a lot about love.Like how sometimes it can be hard to understand.	Carla.When I look into your eyes, I see the future. I see kids, I see minivans...you name it, I see it. The weird thing is, though, as long as I see your smile, none of that stuff scares me.
Other times, love's obvious to everyone.	Mmm.
I don't love you.	Aren't they amazing?
Please don't cry.	What?
Oogh. Agh!My lips are bleeding! Can you hand me a tissue?Aagghh!	We have to go.
That looks like fun. Can I help?	"I do." And then it's classy kiss....Or sexy kiss....Or slutty kiss....
Elliot, maybe you should pay attention to what you're doing.	Uh, help this.
Turk and I have to go.	Oh, really?Uhmm.... How how thin did you want those?
See, Turk and I had made a pact.The day that one of us got married, we'd play a last round of tennis-ball golf in the parking lot as single best friends.	Turk and I have to go.
Look out, Tiger!	See, Turk and I had made a pact.The day that one of us got married, we'd play a last round of tennis-ball golf in the parking lot as single best friends.
Hell yeah.	That'll play.
Oh, yeah, and the guy getting married has to caddie for the other guy naked.	Hell yeah.
He'll be fine.I can't believe you're actually gettin' married.	Huh?
Hey, where's the fuzzy cover for my one-wood?	Me neither, buddy.
Aw, dude! My mom made that!Still, I'm happy for you, man.	It's on my nine-wood.
Thought you guys were getting married at Holy Trinity?	Turk, we're heading over to St. John's.
Ooh, nice use of "finagle."	If I work this shift, I can finagle two extra days on the honeymoon.
Mmm.	Oh, thanks.
Dude, you're dealing with a nervous bride, a woman I scorned, and two sisters with three eyebrows.	Oh! Whoa!
Holla.	Hey, J.Z.
Danni, what are you doing here?	For some reason, this woman wants you to usher her.
You can't just crash my best friend's wedding!	We RSVP'd when we were still dating.
Right this way, please.	I'll go halvsies on the gift.
"Hava nagila, hava nagila, hava nagila..."	"Bum-bum-bum."
Todd! Gimme that!Carla, it's Turk.	Go for the Todd. ... Turk, Turk, Turk, Turk. I can't talk right now! I'm at your wedding.
Where're the other bridesmaids?	Hello?
Well, that's gonna be tough on a Saturday, with Eyebrows Eyebrows Eyebrows being closed. They're gonna have to go all the way across town to the Eyebrow Hut.Look, Elliot, just tell me what you want me to do and I'll do it.	They're out buying an eyebrow.
Sweet!	What do you mean you're gonna be late?
Nothing, girl!	What did you say?
You wouldn't happen to know if Sean Kelly lives here, would you?	I wonder how Sean took it when Elliot dumped him?
It's been four days, Sean. Which, by the way, makes the beard all the more impressive.	Since Elliot left me, my life's fallen apart.
Ah.	I'm a quarter Hungarian.
I didn't steal Elliot from you, man! She just panicked 'cause you guys were moving in together!	What do you want, J.D.?
Sean, if you have any guts at all, you will show up at this wedding, take her into your...hairy arms, and tell her you want her back!You should...probably shower first.	I don't know, J.D....
They had premarital sex.	I don't care about you, you idiot!
Do you ever miss the ladies?	Miss Espinosa, if your fiancé is not here in the next thirty seconds, I'm gonna have to pull the plug.
I would, too.	A little.
There she is! Do something charming.	Give me a bucket of scotch.Sport, take these and keep moving.
Elliot, check it out. Kelso gave me his car keys.	There she is! Do something charming.
I'm I'm just trying to think of ways to make things right!	Ow! What are you doing?!
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!I'm sorry, I get excited.	Hey, Elliot.
Keep walking, dragon.Yagh!	Happy wedding, nerd.
You wore your janitor uniform to a wedding?	How's it goin'?
Who's that?	No, I wasn't invited to the wedding. I just work here on weekends.
Are forks where the big money is?	My date.Forks! Frannie! Forks! Forks!
I know. I know.	I shouldn't be drinking.
Remember that after-party we had in college, when the stereo went out and I ended up hooking up with that grad student from Brazil?	Okay, Carla's dying, it's rally time. We have no band, we have no DJ. You're my best man brainstorm.
That was awesome.	Yeah?
I thought she was kneeling.Ted! Can you play a little music for us, buddy?	Woo hoo, you made out with a little person.
Kick it.	Aaaand, here's four back.
You can't let him drive her home! She says "thank you" the naughty way!	Uh, well...sure.Oh! Okay!
You and I are gonna be okay, right?	J.D.! It's not happening. Besides, if Sean and I are meant to be together, I never would have gone home with you that night and sabotaged everything that I had with him.
Probably not.Elliot!You let me know when we are.	What do you think?
I guess, in the end, things seldom work out exactly the way you expect.	Um, hi. We haven't used instruments in a long time, so bear with us if we're a little rusty.... One, two, three.
Other times, well, you've kind of sealed your own fate.Either way, you have to trust that whatever's supposed to happen, will happen.Besides, somehow you always seem to end up with the person you're meant to be with.	Mm-hmm.
Thanks for helping out.	One, two, three.
Yeah.	Who, that guy right there?
A lot's been going on around here the last two weeks. Turk and Carla got married, that short guy hurt his hand....And since I totally broke Elliot's heart, I was still trying to smooth things over.	All right, thank you.Aaaahhhh.
Hey, buddy. What's with the giant needle?	A lot's been going on around here the last two weeks. Turk and Carla got married, that short guy hurt his hand....And since I totally broke Elliot's heart, I was still trying to smooth things over.
We still had some work to do.Where was I? Oh, yeah. The hospital also had a new attending psychologist.Dr...Molly...Clock.	Hey, buddy. What's with the giant needle?
Not only was Dr. Clock easy on the eyes, but apparently she was an excellent shrink.	I'm I'm kind of a favorite around here!
But I also heard she was a little spacy.	Mr. Witcomb is in the middle of a psychotic break from self-discontinuation of his meds, so we need to get him on Haloperidol IV stat.
Um...we weren't talking.	So where were we?
No, I mean like we've never talked...ever.	Was it 'cause of something you did, 'cause I am totally over it. I don't even remember what it was.
You don't.	Well how do I know your name, then?
It's Johnny.	You're freakin' me out, Jimmy!
Why would you say "Johnny"? You hate "Johnny"!	It's Johnny.
Dammit! Dammit! Dammit!	Now I'm gonna commit it to my memory forever.Johnny.... Johnny.... Johnny....
Dammit!	Okay, Johnny
So let's talk! It's not like I'm going anywhere, right?	I'm sorry, I'm just meeting so many people, and everyone's kind of cliquish and I haven't really gotten to know anybody.
'Scuse me.Turk's back from his honeymoon!	Great! Oh, thanks. Okay
He's here! TURK!	Maybe some day he'll love me like that.
TUUUUUUUUUUUURK!TURK?!	JAAAAAAAY DEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
TURK!	J.D.!J.D.?!
Stay right there! I'm so excited!AWWWW, HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?	DUDE!
I'LL HOLLA!	The roof!
GOT IT!TURK!Eeeeheee!	ALL RIGHT, LOOK, FROM NOW ON, WE'RE CALLING THIS "ROOF A".
Over the next few days, Carla started to change everything.	Ignore him, baby. We have a great relationship. Nothing's gonna change.
First of all, this is a Rice Dream mm, ricey secondly, I can't get out of these new chairs she got. Am I using it right?	Hey, dude, get us some more ice cream.
Mm-hmm.	Hey, J.D.? Although we do appreciate the wedding gift?
I got it.Whoa. I got it. I'm okay. I don't oh, here it goes. Whoa! Aaaagh!I'm still in the chair! I it it's like a bear-trap!	We don't?
As I fondled Katya, my pillow girlfriend, I thought about how things had changed for all of us. You see, I had almost forgotten that when I wake up, it'll be the start of my last week as a resident.	I got it.Whoa. I got it. I'm okay. I don't oh, here it goes. Whoa! Aaaagh!I'm still in the chair! I it it's like a bear-trap!
Snooze!	"I said a hip, hop, the hippy, the hippy to the hip-hip-hop you don't stop the rockin' to the bang bang boogie, said up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogity beat! Now what you hear is not a dream, so listen up, you nappy head! Yo, hear my rhyme, it's wake-up time, so get your white ass outta bed! You see I am what "
I knew he'd buy it, because today feels like one of those great days in the hospital. People really seem to be getting to know each other.	Proceed unmolested.
My last week of residency had begun. In seven days I'd be a full-fledged doctor. It felt pretty special to me, and I had a hunch it meant a lot to one other person as well.	Fantastic. Get off my face.
Sooo, ya felling all, like, blalala!	Yes, milady?
Come on, man, it's our last week together! The J.D. and Cox train is pulling into the station. You must have a metaphor you want to use; hit me with it!	That depends, does "blalalala" mean confused and incredibly annoyed?
Hugh Jackman's Wolverine! How dare he.	I suppose I could riff a list of things that I care as little about as our last week together. Lemme see, uhh.... Low-carb diets. Michael Moore. The Republican National Convention. Kabbalah and all Kabbalah-related products. Hi-def TV, the Bush daughters, wireless hot spots, 'The O.C.', the U.N., recycling, getting Punk'd, Danny Gans, the Latin Grammys, the real Grammys. Jeff, that Wiggle who sleeps too darn much! The Yankees payroll, all the red states, all the blue states, every hybrid car, every talk show host! Everything on the planet, everything in the solar system, everything everything everything everything everything everything eve everything that exists past, present and future, in all discovered and undiscovered dimensions.Oh! And Hugh Jackman. Eh.
Our car? Is it bad?	J.D. A little problem this morning with Malik.
Ah, Malik. Lots of memories in that old car.	Hey, Triple A? Look, I need a pick-up on the corner of Fourth andYou know what? You'll see it.
Driving, mostly.	Of what?
And then the most amazing thing happened.	Baby, a Mini Cooper?
Carla let Turk make a decision!	I'll tell you what, Turk. Why don't you go pick out our car.
There isn't.	Okay! But, baby, you should know that it's not gonna be a Mini. 'Cause ain't nothing really mini about me!
I know you are, but I would love it if you'd at least try.	I'm tired.
Haunting.	"And I would do anything for love, but I won't do that. No, I won't do that."
Mmm.	Drink your juice, Mr. Blass.Mr. Blass has Pick's disease, which is similar to presentation to multi-infarct dementia.
Okay, you gotta take a stand on this "Johnny" thing before it becomes permanent.	Anyhoo, he likes to sing when he gets up in the morning, and the weird thing is, Johnny, he actually captures the mood of the room.
You know what, it's "J.D." for "John Dorian," so so John...look, you know what, Johnny's fine, it's cool.	Okay, you gotta take a stand on this "Johnny" thing before it becomes permanent.
What's wrong with you?	You know what, it's "J.D." for "John Dorian," so so John...look, you know what, Johnny's fine, it's cool.
What floor?	Anyway, Johnny, I was noticing that you were having some trouble motivating your patient back in there, and I actually published a paper on motivation methodology in post-operative seniors, so, if you want, I could help.
You know, Molly, I appreciate the offer, but there's a very special doctor I use around here when I need help, and he'd be pretty pissed if I didn't come to him first.	Oh, my god, we're on an elevator.
Please, you know you love it. Now, come on, one more time for nostalgia's sake: You come see my patient, you teach me a lesson, and then the music plays, right? In my head, it sounds like this: Ba-buh-buh-ba-buh-buh-buh, ba-buh-buh-ba-buh-buh-buh-buhhh.	Why, Mariska? Why do you insist on bothering _me_ with these things?
...Buh-ba-buh-buh-buh-buh-buhh....	Borrow me? Dearheart, you'd be rescuing me.Newbie, you're on your own. Get used to it.
Elliot, you're overreacting. We're not some kind of gang, okay?	Mm-hm. Clever. Look, J.D., I think this is so unfair. I mean, I never get to see Turk and Carla anymore.It's like we got divorced and you get to keep the friends just because you live with them.It just feels like you guys are part of some sort of gang or something.
Wolverines, let's roll!	Okay.
Well, you're the only one, 'cause people in the hall are going crazy!	I'm not a big Guttenberg fan.
Ahh, I know you're new here, but that's my patient's chart, and no one touches my patient's chartexcept for him.	I was just looking at Mr. Radford's chart.
Yes! I knew he couldn't stay away.	Ahh, I know you're new here, but that's my patient's chart, and no one touches my patient's chartexcept for him.
Here comes the magic. He always gives me goosebumps.	I just don't have it in me.
What the hell was that?	Okay, then. I sure hope you're comfortable in that bed, because you're gonna be in one just like it for the rest of your natural born life.
They're small. And...you you can't see them.	Goosebumps?
Well, I'm just glad your surgery went okay and you still have your A game. I don't really care who wins!	I'm still beating you!
Half a brain, dammit!	Well, I'm just glad your surgery went okay and you still have your A game. I don't really care who wins!
Dr. Cox.I just want you to know I'm not ready to give up on Mr. Radford.	Goodnight, Giselle.
I agrizzle, my nizzle.	Do you want me to give you my "things I don't care about" speech again? Because, you know, I've updated it to include all white guys who add -izzle to anything.
...Zanitor.	You're funny. Pocket full of what?
Touché.	Why the stupid face?
Well then I'm sure I can expect an appropriate retaliatory response. Maybe you could shoot me in the neck.	You know, I know you knocked that exit sign down.
What can I say, it's been...horrifying.	Sounds like fun, but no. Our game is over, buddy. Your residency's coming to a close and...that's it, nothing left to do but:
Well, this is kinda cool! Hey, you know, maybe we could, like, be friends.	Thank you!
I'd never tried it.	You like huntin' squirrels?
And the day just got better from there.Mostly because Mr. Radford had the same "screw you, Dr. Cox" attitude that I had.	Easiest thing in the world all you need are some walnuts...and a boxing glove!
Good stuff, Mr. Radford! I'm proud of you!	And the day just got better from there.Mostly because Mr. Radford had the same "screw you, Dr. Cox" attitude that I had.
Okay, but stand back. These things can be pretty dangerous!Whoa. Oh, boy. Whooooaaaa! Agghhh!Aaaaggglghlgggh! Aggghhh!	Excuse me, doctor. I dropped a nickel in that therapy whirlpool. You think you could get it for me?
Actually, no, I almost drowned diving for a nickel; but I'm sure you're more interested in conspiracy theories about gangs and friend stealing. Peace out.	So, what, are they shooting some sort of Geeks of Sacred Heart calendar out here?
Did you not see what just happened, or do you not get face rubbing? Because it's more than just a bizarro way to memorize people's names.	That is so great! But I wouldn't do that unless you want him to rub your face in it.
I must go to one of those.	Johnny, I mean what Dr. Cox did was classic reverse psychology. And so is this: Behavioral modification can sometimes be brought about through classic conditioning.Reverse psychology? Nothing? 'Cause that really kills at the psychiatric conferences.
Hmm, no.	Look, isn't it possible that Dr. Cox tricked you as a motivational ploy?
Nnoo! You're like a crazy person!	After he said there was no hope with Mr. Radford, didn't you both work harder?
Uh, excuse me, I'm not a child. I'm a doctor.	Look, I'll tell you something else. I mean, Dr. Cox is a text-book closed-off alpha male. I mean, you can try forever, but you're never gonna get that hug that you really want.
And I'll get that hug!	Uh, excuse me, I'm not a child. I'm a doctor.
How does he know about my belly rash?	Look at that. I knew I smelled that odd combination of fear and baby powder.
Look, Dr. Cox, I know you were using reverse psychology with Mr. Radford.	How does he know about my belly rash?
Yes. And I figured it out all by myself, without anyone helping me or explaining it directly in my face or anything.	You do, do you?
Oh, my God, it's finally happening! Don't miss a moment! Take it all in! Ba-buh-ba-buh-buh-buhh, buh-ba-ba-ba-ba-buh-buhhh	Well, nubile one, your last lesson and you didn't even need it.Three years and it's finally over. I know what you want, I do.Come here.
Ow.	Oh, my God, it's finally happening! Don't miss a moment! Take it all in! Ba-buh-ba-buh-buh-buhh, buh-ba-ba-ba-ba-buh-buhhh
Whether or not you survive in a hospital is all about how you handle your relationships.	Good God, Fantasia. You you don't actually think I'm done teaching you, do you? D'you not understand the only difference between today and tomorrow is that you wake up tomorrow and start coming in here and killing people, that no one can say, "It's no big deal, he's just a resident." Instead, what they're damn sure gonna be wondering is who tried to educate your sorry ass. And when that finger of blame starts pointing in my direction, I had damn sure better be in a coma from the anger stroke I suffered from the last time you tried to hug me.Oh, and, uh, don't be late tomorrow...Doctor.
Whether it's a brand new one...	"All by myself / Don't wanna be..."Elliot
...or an old one you need to figure out all over again.	"...all by myself!"Elliot
As for me, it was my relationships that got me through my residency.	Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
Ba-buh-buh-buh-ba-buh-buh-buhhh. Buh-buh-buh-buh-ba	As for me, it was my relationships that got me through my residency.
Hooogh! Aaaaaaaaaaauuuugggghhh!Oof.	Ba-buh-buh-buh-ba-buh-buh-buhhh. Buh-buh-buh-buh-ba
We're not done with our thing yet, are we.	Bull's eye!
The weird thing is, he was right.	No. For you, it's all just beginning.
Will do.	See ya tomorrow!
Or maybe I was nervous because at 3 o'clock, Dr. Cox was gonna name me the new chief resident. How do I know? Well, for one thing, I'm the only one who applied. But I'm also the only one who's truly focused enough to	Will do.
Oh, God.	Or maybe I was nervous because at 3 o'clock, Dr. Cox was gonna name me the new chief resident. How do I know? Well, for one thing, I'm the only one who applied. But I'm also the only one who's truly focused enough to
Well, we didn't come straight here.Come on, Dorian. You gotta want it!	So lemme get this straight: You crashed in to their truck, and they just drive you to work?
It wasn't all bad.Bubble wrap! Bubble wrap! Bubble wrap!	Hold up. They made you move furniture?
Dr. Molly Clock, the new attending psychiatrist. Yes, she was HOHHHT! But I wasn't a fan. For one thing, she's always calling me "Johnny." Also, she wasn't very nice.	Yeah! Bubble wrap!
What. A. Bitch. Plus, she's _always_ with Elliot; and since I dumped her, we weren't getting along all that great.	Hey, sit with us. We'll make room, even if I have to stand.
Anybody got any extra ketchup packets?Thank you, Elliot.	What. A. Bitch. Plus, she's _always_ with Elliot; and since I dumped her, we weren't getting along all that great.
Sorry, ladies, job's taken.	I know!
She asked, without a prayer.	Can I still be considered as a candidate for the chief residency?
I just needed to talk to someone.	You okay, buddy?
What? How does he know that?	Tough break, J.D. You've dreamed of being chief resident ever since you were a little boy growing up in Trotwood, Ohio.
Thank you, Frank.	What? How does he know that?
Not in me I mean, on me.	Hey, do you have a magazine?
Sir?	He donated a wing, a thigh, and a breast.
Please, sir, I totally get that.	Yes, genius, in this metaphor the hospital is a chicken.
How could a hospital be a chicken?	Please, sir, I totally get that.
What a jerk!	Focus on nothing else.
I am a medical professional, and you are not gonna get me to compete with Elliot.	Top-notch work, there, Barbie! She's good! She's very, very, _very_ good!
Let me know how to get back on top. I'll do anything, even if it means I have to kill somebody!	Well, Jo-Jo, right now she's winning.
Oh, I'll impress you!Hit the water!	Well, you could start by getting the lightbulb out of this genius's pooper. Impress me.
I'll impress him some other way.	Oh, I'll impress you!Hit the water!
Doug! Stay positive.	I'll impress him some other way.
When Turk told me he pissed Dr. Cox off by stealing his moment, I decided not to share it with Elliot.	'Scuse me.
Whoooooooooo. Wow. Don't feel bad, you couldn't have seen it coming. Awful, though.	Pssst! Barbie! Listen carefully, because the policy remains unchanged: Unless someone is dying and puh-lease note _dying_ not _dead_ I'm not interested. And P.S., just a real strong showing for a chief resident candidate. God almighty!
I didn't feel bad, because a lot of people were playing dirty around here.	Whoooooooooo. Wow. Don't feel bad, you couldn't have seen it coming. Awful, though.
It's 3 o'clock! 3 o'clock's when you announce new chief resident, so we thought you might want	What?
Very funny!	Barbie. You're chief resident.
Keep it together. It's be a man time.	Newbie, how ya doin'?
No, no. I totally understand. Come on, you did what you had to do. You went with your gut; Elliot's a great doctor. I do have three questions, though: Why do you hate me when I show you nothing but love? Who's gonna tell my mom? And what the hell am I supposed to do with ten thousand "John Dorian, Chief Resident" business cards!?!?!	Keep it together. It's be a man time.
Uh, what now?	Yeah, Scarlett? You're chief resident too.
Wait, so, if we're both gonna be chief residents, why didn't you just say that from the beginning?	Well, I figure with her being ridiculously book-smart to the point where she has almost no interpersonal skills, and you being warm and cuddly as an un-potty trained labradoodle and about as useful in high-stress medical situations as an un-potty trained labradoodle _together_ the two of you make one barely passable doctor...slash labradoodle.
John Dorian, chief resident.It's just that Elliot and I doing this together is gonna be a little tough we're going through a bit of a rough patch.	What, and miss your hall of fame hissy? Not on your life.
Conflict is everywhere. Whether it's out in the open......or bubbling just under the surface.	Whasssup! Dr. Tizzurk is in the hizzouse...!
I guess the only thing to do when you're in the middle of it is to hope that nothing makes it worse.	Really.
Owwww!	Cleaning time!Don't worry, I'll go fast.
It burns!	Whoop, that one got away.
Oh, no.	You guys, the situation would be perfect for my study.
Great. Maybe we could make it permanent.	Don't worry, Johnny. Everyone's gonna be anonymous, I'm only using initials. You'll be "J.D."
Of course not.	Johnny!
We decided to go petty.	The way I see it, you guys can either get past it and talk like adults, or you can behave like petty children.
I'll take Doug.	Okay, instead of sharing you all, we're gonna separate you into two resident teams so that J.D. and I never have to see each other.
Relax, Doug, you're the only one whose name I know.	YES! Suck on that!Thanks, J.D. First pick.
Shut up, Doug!	Pick the hot chick.
John Dorian, chief resident. Website's on the back.	Yeah, uh, name's Amy, actually.
Elliot and I weren't the only ones who decided to go petty.	Hey! I got like a two-hour break between patients, do you wanna grab lunch? Or dinner, I'm not really sure what time it is.
Okay, she's gone.Now, I've heard some rumors there's been some fraternizing with some of Dr. Reid's residents. Now, I don't want to mention any names...but, Slobodan, enough of that crap!	Keep up, people! We got pre-rounds to do!
Now, come on, you nerds!	Watch your ass.
Unbelievable, Doug.	Doug wanted me to give this patient five hundred thousand milligrams of Morphine. I thought I'd check with you before I killed a man.
Do whatever you want, just don't come over to my area.	Don't worry, I just came to check on my patients.
Well, I wouldn't pay you.	You couldn't pay me to come over to your area.
It just so happens I have a rich uncle who'd do anything for me, but I'd never call in that favor just to pay you to come over to my area!	Well, you don't have enough money.
Got her!	It just so happens I have a rich uncle who'd do anything for me, but I'd never call in that favor just to pay you to come over to my area!
Elliot, he's in V-tach.	I hate to interrupt, but I think you need to take a look at this man.
We need a one milligram Epi.	Get the crash cart.
The best thing about this place is that when someone's really in trouble, all the pettiness melts away.	We need a one milligram Epi.
Can you imagine us trying to do that three years ago?	Glad to do it. Oh, and, uh, Bart, I think Lyle might be ready for that rough-sex-play talk you had with your other boys.Too late!
Well, I remember hiding in a supply closet.	I know.
Ultimately, conflict is resolved by remembering why you were friends in the first place.	That's the one.
Or by swallowing your pride.	You should talk to her. You know her better.
Or by uniting against a moment-stealing common enemy who took credit for your ingenious method of de-bulbing a patient's keister!	He's coming. He's coming! Get your ass out here!
In the end, though, it doesn't really matter how you get there. As long as you're friends again.	Good Lord!
I miss this. This, like, hanging out, you know?	In the end, though, it doesn't really matter how you get there. As long as you're friends again.
We should go get coffee.	Me too.
No, no, I mean like, like outside coffee real world coffee.The point is, we should...hang out outside the hospital sometime.	We're having coffee.
Is it fixed now?	J.D., I still need time. I know that's gonna be hard for you because you like to fix everything right way, but...you just do the best you can, okay?
Shoot!	Nope.
No, I have rocks in my shoe.	What's that, your new, uh, cool guy walk?
Wow, that's a lot of rocks. I gotta stop taking that short-cut through the quarry.	No, I have rocks in my shoe.
Anyway, the best thing about my new job is that I command a lot more respect.	Wow, that's a lot of rocks. I gotta stop taking that short-cut through the quarry.
Chief resident in the house! Everybody say hey-ay!	Anyway, the best thing about my new job is that I command a lot more respect.
Even though Councilman Donovan was handcuffed to that chair because once again he was flying high on crystal meth, his respect felt good. Honestly, it's the reason I keep voting for him.	HEEEY-AAAY!
It was the same old Dr. Cox and Jordan. The weird thing was, there was something underneath it they were happy.	Come here!
I've never seen Dr. Cox and Jordan speechless before. It was neat-o!	Well, mazel tovs all around!
Oh, what, is that supposed to intimidate me or something?	Just so you know, I think this chief resident thing has made you a little too big for your britches? Soo...from now on I'm gonna be your britches shrinker.
What possible reason could you have for breaking your broom in half?	No. I had to do it anyway.
Yeah, it's a new game I made up this morning when I had rocks in my shoes.	"Graveled"??
Better than Play-Doh Pants?	I like it.
Wise!	Play-Doh Pants became all about the money.
It felt good cheering Turk up. See, now that I'm chief studly, I was making a lot more money than him. Needless to say it was a time to be extra sensitive.	Wise!
Hey, you remember how I make more money than you now?	It felt good cheering Turk up. See, now that I'm chief studly, I was making a lot more money than him. Needless to say it was a time to be extra sensitive.
Here's five bucks for remembering. Anyway, I was thinking about spending some of my extra ducats on one of those classy suits we always wanted!	Yeah?
You know it, dawg!	You mean the leather purple jumpsuit Eddie Murphy wore in 'Raw'?
What's a question-talker?	That's cold!Look, I gotta go. I've got a new attending and he hates it when we're late. Plus he's a question-talker.
You know, unless there's someone I could doink.	John Dorian, Chief Resident.
Hey, uh, you need to move your car it's my day to have the parking spot.	You know, unless there's someone I could doink.
Mmmm, it sends a message.	J.D., you have a scooter! Why do you even need a parking spot?
Just because I lured her away from her perfect boyfriend and then dumped her doesn't mean my scooter, Sasha, needs to suffer.	Mmmm, it sends a message.
What are you doing?	Just because I lured her away from her perfect boyfriend and then dumped her doesn't mean my scooter, Sasha, needs to suffer.
You can try as hard as you want, that is never gonna stick.	Just making it official.Chief. Co-Chief.
Dammit! You are quick!	Oh! And that's Co-Chief Resident Dorian over there!
Ahhh! Thank you, Barry! Hey! That's for Barry Jr.!What? The little guy's in leg braces.	This Todd thing is killing me.Where's your lunch?
Of course, marriage can make the rest of your life seem longer.	Are you kidding me? I'm gonna wear this the rest of my life!
Yep, there was definitely trouble in paradise.	Look, Attilathere's no way in hell that I'm gonna listen to you complain about the rest of your life for the rest of my life, you got that?Jordan: Yeah, not listening. By the way, now that we're married again, we've gotta make out new wills in case one of us dies.Oh, God, I hope it's me.
Well, Mrs. Covello, your CAT-scan showed a small rectal tumor, so I want to schedule a low anterior resection. But don't worry, we have an amazing surgical team here, okay?	Would Co-Chief Dorian please report to the I.C.U.? Co-Chief Dorian? Co-Chief?
Heh.	That means a lot coming from the co-chief resident!
How did she hear? She's been in a coma for two weeks!	Heh.
Dammit.	How did she hear? She's been in a coma for two weeks!
Sure.	Hey, buddy! Can I talk to you for a second?
What's the Todd doing?	I know the Todd's doing her resection, but if you send her down right now, he's a little busy so it'd have to be me.
Yeah?	Yeah, well, you know the city surveyor is outside taking pictures of the hospital for the zoning commission?
Ha!	I told him they were shooting a Sacred Heart calendar.
I don't know, Turk. It's a little early for me to start pulling strings I just got this co-chief job. Dammit, now I'm saying it!	Gentlemen! Say hello to June!How about a sneak-peek of July!
Mmmggghhh! Okay!	Come on, man, get me back in the game!
You know what, here's ten bucks for letting me help you out. Spend it wisely!	O-kay!Okay!
Around here, there's always at least one person that'll come through for you.In Turk's case, that was me.J.D.: Hey, Elliot! Hey, I want to talk to you about this whole chief resident thing.	Tell me more about yourself.
Well, as you may have heard from the loudspeaker, some residents, the janitor, my mother, your mother, and a...a coma patient, um, I'm being referred to as the "co-" chief resident. I think we should either both go with "co-chief" or "chief." Don't you...co-agree?	What about it?
Well, that's easy, Lonnie, what you want to do	Excuse me. We're working up this patient for a hypercoagulable state with a prolonged PTT? What's our next step?
We're both chief residents. Isn't that right, Dr. Reid?	I'd like my answer from the chief resident.
Shut up, Lonnie!	'S why she's the chief. You're the co-chief.
Dammit! I used 'em all up watching 'Barber Shop 9'.	You know, you only got one more black joke this month before I bust your ass.
How'd surgery go?	Okay, that's it, and I'll get you later.
It can be scary to stick your neck out for a friend. That's why it's a huge relief when they come through.	Oh, you know, I was on top of my game.
How's she doing?	It can be scary to stick your neck out for a friend. That's why it's a huge relief when they come through.
What?	Uh...unfortunately she didn't make it.
I couldn't help wonder if by taking that patient from Todd and giving her to Turk, I had toyed with fate.	J.D., I did everything I could. Even my attending thought I did great. He said, "Do I think you did great? Yes I do!"
How could you know that look? It's a brand new look!	I know that look. You're wondering if you toyed with fate!
Okay, we have been spending way too much time together.	Oh my God! That's your "the Todd would've pulled his own heart out" look!
In a hospital, it's hard not to let your personal life affect your professional life.	Oh-ho-ho, wrong day, new chick!
Dr. Kelso, could you help me out? People have been referring to me as the co-chief resident.	Hey, you fixed him! Come on, buddy!J.D.'s Thoughts: That's it!
But I'm the chief resident. Look, Dr. Reid's check is made out to the chief resident, and and mine's made out to the co-chief resident. But we both make the same amount.	Well, it sounds like something you should take up with the chief resident.
I could spend all day worrying about what just happened, but I have more important things to do.	Coolio, indeed.
Hey, man. Look what I confiscated from one of the kids in Pediatrics.	I could spend all day worrying about what just happened, but I have more important things to do.
What, too hot?	OWWW!
Sorry.	YEAH!
Okay, well, look, we both might have had bad days, but I got just the thing that's gonna cheer us up.Ahhh? Dream come true, right!	Not in the mood!
Oh, now I get it. You're just mad because I make more money than you.	Do you really think I want this suit?Well, I do. But not from you!
You are such a wuss!Turk, come on.Ah, these things chafe. Now I know why Eddie called it "Raw."Carla! Do you have any powder?	No, I'm mad because of that surgery today. You doubted me.
What co-chief stuff? I haven't even been thinking about it.	Listen, I probably shoulda put a stop to all this co-chief stuff.
Okay....	Look, J.D., ever since you dumped me, everyone around here's been treating me like some kind of a victim. It's like, "Ohh, look at poor Elliot going home alone." Or, "Ohh, look at poor Elliot riding a tandem bike by herself." That's not something I normally do, I just really wanted ice cream the other night, my car was out of gas, and that's the bike the Gundersons loaned me. They do everything together....
She's got fingers like biceps!	The point is it was nice being the one chief resident for a while, you know?
Mm-mm.Thirsty, huh?	You have no chance of being normal.
Cheers.So! How you guys gonna celebrate your divorce?	Helps the tears taste less bitter.
Oh my God! Dude! I doubted you for a second, why are you so mad?	By not inviting you!
Did you, uh...?	What the? Ow, ow, ow, what?
Nice work.Look, man, it was one second of doubt, okay? Since when do you care what anybody else thinks?	Yeah, she's been graveled.
Wow. That's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.	your being like that's one of the reasons I've gotten to where I am.
In the end, every relationship needs maintenance.	Wow. That's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.
...Whether it's the smallest gesture...	You owe me money!
...or just picking up back where you left off.	Well, I'm gonna ignore it, but...yeah, knock yourself out.
Aw, you'll kick ass.	I'm a little nervous about surgery tomorrow.
Are your giblets warm?	Well, I'll be in the bedroom with all the straight people.
Same!	Like a Christmas ham!
The bottom line is that if you care about someone, it's pretty easy to make the sacrifice.	Same!
And she's just been graveled!	Wow. Thanks, J.D.Ow!
Hey, Ron, the I Don't Care ward's down there.	Hey! I'm Ron, I'm a new doctor here.
Anyway, the person who reached out to Molly...was Elliot.	Hey, Ron, the I Don't Care ward's down there.
It's not.	Oh, I don't know. I'm pretty tone-deaf. And I do these, like, kick moves that I don't think people really get. Plus I sometimes wear a cape.
Ooh, Dr. Cox, can I ask you something?	It's not.
First of all, they were just big socks, okay? And secondly, if you need to do some laundry, here's the washboard, right?	The answer is yes, it was me who saw you doing leg lifts in the gym on that inflatable ball. It was quite the display of girl power. Absolutely loved the leg warmers!
As co-chief resident, I've noticed that some of my residents are a little overwhelmed. And I-I-I think it would be nice if you gave 'em one of your patented pep-talks, you know?	What do you want?
Doug!!! Stop writing and go!	he just might go ahead and get himself a good clean kill this morning, seeing as his patient, Mrs. Samson, is in DKA and he hasn't been tracking her phosphate level. Her phosphate level. Her phosphate level.
Thank you...thank you, Dr. Cox.... Uhh, okay, guys, pizza and punch in the penthouse.Doug!Wrong patient one bed over.	That young man has killed so many patients, I'm starting to think he just might be a government operative.
So anyway, after Dr. Cox scared them, no one wanted pizza or punch. Except for Doug, who'd worked up a hearty appetite neglecting Mrs. Samson into a coma.	Mm.That's the good stuff!
He's a pure-bred it's genetic.	Baby, could you do me a favor and not hold him by the haunches like that? Yeah, he has hip dysplasia.
Don't listen to him! He's drunk on cheese!	Wow, isn't that a shocker, you don't care about something that's important to me. You know what? Why don't you just throw him out?
Easy, boy. She ain't worth it.	What's he gonna do?
That's not up to me, Mrs. Carter. It's up to the police and the owner of those horses you killed.	Can I drive my trans-am?
You were on a race-track, Mrs. Carter.	Ohhh, they were everywhere!
Mr. Daniels, some fluid has gathered near your heart, so I'm gonna schedule a periocardiocentesis and drain it with a needle.	Of course not. Those things'll kill ya.
Not just someone Dr. de Man.	Someone's gonna stick a needle in my chest?
Say it...say it without the "Dr."	Who is Dr. de Man?
No, just say the the last name.	Who's Mr. de Man?
I'm de Man!	Who's de Man?
All right, now that you've got his confidence, drive it home.	I'm de Man!
So I'll go ahead and schedule the procedure.	All right, now that you've got his confidence, drive it home.
I do.Dr. Cox, I want to thank you for that "everyone's a murderer" speech. Nice scare tactic. Unfortunately, my residents have stopped eating.	If you think it's the right thing to do.
It's strange. Even though a lot of patients have died under my care, I don't think I've killed any of them....	That wasn't a scare tactic, Portia! Eventually everyone commits a sin of omission or doesn't act quickly enough, and somebody kicks the bucket. It's really...it's really not a question of "if" it's a question of "when."
Heaven's a diner?	It's strange. Even though a lot of patients have died under my care, I don't think I've killed any of them....
Ooh! Maybe I'll have some flapjacks!	Get anything you want, dear.
No flapjacks in heaven!?! Are flapjacks evil?	They don't have those.
You know what? I left my wallet back on earth.Haha! Suckers!	Oh, like a little bird!
And it turned out Turk wasn't the only one.	Hell yeah, I have. Remember my first year? Mr. Quinn? I forgot to write the order for his albumin drip and he...hemorrhaged and died.
Oh my God. I'm gonna kill someone.	No, Newbie, I have not killed. But I happen to be, as always, the exception that proves the rule. So, right about now, you gotta be asking yourself, do you think you're that good?
See?	You know, I feel good about this procedure.
This procedure's too risky right now, Mr. Daniels, I think we should wait.	See?
And, of course, the classic, "No matter how clean the janitor gets your husband's dead dog, you still need to put him in the trunk and not accidentally leave him on the roof when you drive off."And finally, the lesser-known, "You can accomplish anything with a friend by your side."	This procedure's too risky right now, Mr. Daniels, I think we should wait.
Of course, sometimes friends will surprise you.	Dr. Clock. Edwards, here, is at best just a few minutes away from walking towards the light, so what's say you stop wasting our time and give me your professional opinion.
Now you're gonna lie here. Don't be too specific!	Ah! Kiki Dee! I heard Mr. Daniels isn't getting his periocardiocentesis. Since when?
Since 1:42 yesterday afternoon. His wife did not want him to do it. She's beautiful, by the way one green eye, one blue. She's from Luxembourg. They're both from Luxembourg. I believe they're, uh, Luxem...bourgian.	Now you're gonna lie here. Don't be too specific!
What are the odds? Just stay vague.	Where in Luxembourg? I-I spent two weeks there.
Uh, outside Mertert, near the German border.	What are the odds? Just stay vague.
They say what they miss most are those lazy summer afternoons on the Moselle River.	Ah.
You are channeling that seventh grade book report!	They say what they miss most are those lazy summer afternoons on the Moselle River.
Bullet dodged! He totally bought it! Hey, where's he taking me?	Okay. Okay, then.
That's okay. 'Cause I wasn't the only one lying around here.	I know that took quite a bit of cajoling, but I think I was able to convince him.
Hey, Turk, can I talk to you for a second?	Okay.
Can I talk to you for a second?	Can't talk now, good stuff's happenin'!
"Eyebrows." Like that's gonna make youElliot, come on, you can't be that insecure.	Eyebrows.
I have to go.	Giant Adam's apple!
Elliot's comment didn't bother me, because I'm proud of the body God gave me.Besides, I had bigger problems. I had to do Mr. Daniels' procedure. Luckily I'm a professional, and professionals finish the job.	I have to go.
This needle is too sticky! I'm out! Get it together, Laverne!	Elliot's comment didn't bother me, because I'm proud of the body God gave me.Besides, I had bigger problems. I had to do Mr. Daniels' procedure. Luckily I'm a professional, and professionals finish the job.
Who?	Hey, Peggy? Yes, I noticed the turtleneck choice in August, and can only assume it's got something to do with that grapefruit you store in your trachea. Let me put your mind at ease: You've killed before.
Whoa. Bye-bye.	Do you remember Mrs. Carter?
She died?	Wahoooo!
The weird thing was that I was a little happy.	Three days ago of endocarditis. You didn't get blood cultures and you missed it. You happy?
Sticky needle please!	The weird thing was that I was a little happy.
Mrs. Carter?	Mmm.
You know what, I don't appreciate lying.	Ooh, did I trick Newbie? I did, didn't I!
One of the hardest things around here is that sometimes you don't get to know how things end.	Come on. I know you're scared. A lot of times you feel like a little girl in a big gal's body. But here's the dirty little secret: Fear is good. It keeps you from becoming a crappy doctor. Trick is you just can't let it paralyze you. But don't you worry about a thing, there, Newbie. You're a sure thing to get a kill. In fact, should be any day now!
...Whether it's wondering if your husband will realize you replaced his dead dog with a shorter replica......Or wondering when and if you're gonna kill that first person.	They look really good.
Okay, everybody, watch closely, because if you're not careful, you can cause a pneumothorax.	...Whether it's wondering if your husband will realize you replaced his dead dog with a shorter replica......Or wondering when and if you're gonna kill that first person.
Ultimately it'll drive you crazy if you don't have a friend to help you through it.	Okay, everybody, watch closely, because if you're not careful, you can cause a pneumothorax.
Excuse me, Mrs. MacCalla.	Did you just say I was moderately attractive?
Come on, Carla, I wanted a hook and I only had one other idea.Mr. Hawkins, the results of your tests are back, and you have	You two are idiots!
Sorry, that's all he can say. Anyway, you don't have liver disease you have inoperable lung cancer.	Liver disease! Liver disease!
If only, Chauncy.Bottom line, that tape recorder won't fly away and break your heart.	Liver disease!
Gesundheit!	Are you crazy? No, Turk. But
I love my new tape recorder. Not only is it a time-saver, I can record my every thought.	Gesundheit!
I like toast.	I love my new tape recorder. Not only is it a time-saver, I can record my every thought.
They aren't all winners. Still, as long as I have this thing, I don't need to be in my head so much.	I like toast.
Half of what rappers say doesn't make any sense. Like that Snoop Dogg-Dr. Dre song? What does "still hittin' them corners and those ho-hos girl" mean?	She makes me do things I don't normally do.She's the Peppermint Patty to my Marcy you know, minus the thick glasses and the strong lesbian vibe.
I got it on tape.	None of you can prove it!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaagh!	He is so sweet! But why doesn't he just put up a sign that says "wet floor"?
Sorry I'm late! I was recording some thoughts and I slipped and fell.	Wet floor.
Possible nicknames for Dr. Cox when we become best friends: The Coxinator. Cox of Seagulls. Hooooooog!	Gimme this!
Oh, sir, I don't know about that. Some people say I'm	Since you two have become chief residents, I've noticed that your leadership skills are how can I put this delicately? eh...crap.
Easy. Lonnie?	Well, then, why don't you go ahead and get that young resident back there to come up here?
"Preparation, Inspiration, and Fear"?	Well, you're better off watching good ol' Papa Smurf, here! Yeah, he says leadership boils down to three things: Smurferation, Smurferation, Smurf.
Ooh, are we playing pillow feet again?	You know it.
Are there any more questions about evolving treatment therapies?	Check out my man getting his leadership on!
Now, I just want you to know, you guys all have the potential to be amazing doctors.	Next, inspiration.
M'kay, I'll see you guys.AAAAGGGHHH!!!	And finally, a dose of fear.
AAAGGGHHH!	Agh!
AGH!	Agh!
That's how I Smurf, baby.	Okay, fear might need a little work, but otherwise Smurftastic!
I'm feeling so good today!I still feel good, 'cause nobody saw me fall!That sound you're hearing is my residents' respect. It feels good.	God, that felt great! Huh. Hopefully it won't have ramifications for anyone else.
I'm sorry I'm late, but I was singing and I fell. And I know I've used the falling excuse before, but it happened again!	GLORIA! You're supposed to start pre-rounds at 7 o'clock. It's now 7:03.
Kill Lonnie.	Ha-ha!
Guys? Guys. Guys!	Will people around here ever respect me?
See, there's no fear! Can you help a brother out?	Hey, J.D.
You had a bedtime when you were seventeen?	Dude, I've got my own problems! I've got a bedtime again! I haven't had a bedtime in like twelve years!
Oh. That's way cooler.	No! Not every night. On the weekends I didn't have to be in bed by 11, but I had to be in my room.
Carla's setting some kind of record on being a major pain the ass, and I can't help you.	The point is Carla's setting some kind of record on being a major pain in the ass, and I can't help you.
You yelled at me in front of my residents!	We didn't order any of the pain in the ass.
So how's about you learn to walk, ditch the tape recorder, and act like you got a pair!	I didn't yell at ya.
You ruined my credibility! Now look me in the eyes and tell me that's not messed up!	Here I was thinking the same thing, Bob. Let's do this again.Tell you what, there, Gidget, if you promise to leave right now, I won't yell at you in front of your peons anymore.
Can you pull off contrite?	Fair enough. Later on today when you are with your residents, I'll come up for something, you'll tell me you're too busy in a manly way, and I will contritely turn around and walk out of the room with my tail between my legs. Problem solved.
Should have seen that coming.	Can you pull off manly way?
I'm a little busy right now, Perry!	Newbie, I need to talk to you?
Oh, and another thing.From now on, I'd prefer it if you'd address me as "Dr. Dorian."	Oh. My fault, I'll come back later.
You bet your ass I am.	Are you really doing this?
I simply will not tolerate it, Perry! And neither will my boys!	Wrap it up, there, bingo.
It was worth it.Lonnie, slap the face!All of you, slap your faces!Awesome.	The next minute you find yourself alone, I'm gonna kill ya.
Hello, tiny ladies! I don't believe we've met! I'm the world's most giant doctor! Nice to	Yeah, I've dated some pretty immature guys, too.
As I watched Elliot and Molly walk off, and thought about how Lonnie was a much less stable giant doctor base than Turk, I realized how important it is to have someone close to you that you can count on.	Hello, tiny ladies! I don't believe we've met! I'm the world's most giant doctor! Nice to
Whoooagh! Ow! Lonnie! Damn you!	As I watched Elliot and Molly walk off, and thought about how Lonnie was a much less stable giant doctor base than Turk, I realized how important it is to have someone close to you that you can count on.
Especially if that someone is a resident that can keep Dr. Cox from killing you.	Whoooagh! Ow! Lonnie! Damn you!
Not in front of my boys! This is Lonnie! He's one of my boys!Not sure what that means. See you later.	Especially if that someone is a resident that can keep Dr. Cox from killing you.
Sometimes you have to keep people closer than you'd like.	Not in front of my boys! This is Lonnie! He's one of my boys!Not sure what that means. See you later.
In my case, it was best just to keep my distance.	That was too easy. No way I'm doing that seven nights a week.
I wonder if we're going to a happy place?	Can I have a word with you?Go.
One thing Turk couldn't get accustomed to was his wife being friends with a psychiatrist.	People are laughing with you! People are laughing with you. People are laughing... ... with... you.
I'll take this one.	Please, I mean, who could imagine what it's like in your head?
Dammit! Molly, you're a shrink: why is it my daydreams always end right before the sexy part.	Yeah, me too.
Dammit!	I don't know, maybe we should work on that... together.
Snap out of it! Abort! ABORT!	Dude! Relax... and enjoy hot chocolate love.
Stop it! I don't have gay jungle fever!!!	Snap out of it! Abort! ABORT!
Telling a family their loved one has died is never easy. That's why doctors have a variety of techniques for breaking the news. There's the hand on shoulder...... there's hand on hand...And, of course, the always popular Resident Kabuki Theater.	Fantastic.
I'm sorry for your loss.	Telling a family their loved one has died is never easy. That's why doctors have a variety of techniques for breaking the news. There's the hand on shoulder...... there's hand on hand...And, of course, the always popular Resident Kabuki Theater.
We did it with cake.	Hey, little brother!
What happened?	We did it with cake.
Dan.	What, a guy can't take three days off work, travel eight hundred miles on a bus with a double-layer fudge cake just to say "Hey, how're things?"
There's ice cream in the fridge.	Dad died.
It was all right; we spent most of the time dealing with the headstone problem. See, since Dad was an office supplies salesman, he wanted it to be shaped like a pencil.	You guys are back. Sorry I had to blow out of there after the funeral, but how was the rest of the week?
I don't know... it hasn't really hit me yet.	How you doing, buddy?
Dan, I love you, but being there for people isn't really yo' thang.	Oh, it will eventually. But don't worry when it does, Big Bro' will be there.What? What is it?
Dan, you've been in here for, like, nine hours: you okay?	No, that was Old Dan. Look at me: this is New Dan! I'm totally here for you.
You know, it wasn't exactly easy showering with you in there.	I'm up!
You think you'll get out of the tub today?	Well, it wasn't exactly easy for me, either. You have Dad's butt.
No, look, I put a six-pack for you in the toilet.	Yeah, today doesn't look good by the way, could you get me another beer?
I gotta go to work!	Ooh.
Even though I deal with death every time I walk into this place, I never dealt with it from this side before. It's full of surprises, whether it's a small gesture from a co-worker...... or a big gesture from someone you've never even met before.	Nothing.
... although sometimes, it's a little awkward, even with an old friend.	Walk tall, kiddo.
Hey.	Hey.
Yeah.	I just wanted to...
Thanks.	Look...
'Kay.	'Kay.
Okay.	Oh, didn't anyone tell you? They switched your shift. You're off today.
Maybe it was because I finally slowed down, maybe it was remembering Dad's passion for bodily functions, I don't know. But at that moment, it all hit me. Unfortunately, I'm not sure Dan's the guy to talk about it with.	Oh, thaaank you.Hey, Dan, if Dad were here right now, what would you say to him?I think he'd be glad to hear that.
There's a lot in life that can let you down.It can be your mind...... or your body...	Slow down, little duck. Some ducks can't hold their water. It's okay. I know.
Really? Not even just like two seconds to talk to me.	Uh, no.
You know what sucks? I thought you were actually going to come through for me this time.	Look, Newbie. Oh, for God's sake. I'm a little swamped, here. Thank you.
Well, I didn't ask you to do any of that, did I?	In a minute! Hey, Newbie? Just in case you didn't actually notice, I have been covering all your patients, answering all your pages, and doing pretty much everything shy of picking up your sundress from the drycleaners.
So now you're making fun of me because I need a little help getting through this?	I'm giving you a hug.Oh. I was wondering what that crane was for. So now, how would you like this whole hug thing to go down? Do you wish to remain seated, would you like to stand? I, of course, don't care, as long as it's under three seconds and I don't feel your breath on my neck.
You know what, I am sick of getting dumped on, and I am sick of you!	No, I'm I'm really trying.
Oh, really, why not?	Newbie, don't shove me.
When someone shoves you like this?	Because whenever anyone shoves me more than twice, my mind goes blank and all I see is this white-hot flash of fury.
Uh, yeah!	On the window, huh?
Oh, God, who died?	Here we go.
What's the occasion?	Yeah!
Really?	I... have type II diabetes.
That sucks. Carla is aware that if you eat that your foot will fall off, right?	Yeah.
Why haven't you told her?	Oh, hell yeah!
You can tell me anything.	I'm not sure. Can I tell you something weird, though?
Oh my God, just this second I was thinking your diabetes is gonna get in the way of my dad dying. Isn't that funny?	I feel like your dad dying has stolen my diabetes thunder.
Dan? You were out with him? I thought you'd dissolved.	Put that on.
What do you want me to talk about? The pros and cons of blitzing a weak-side quarter when you're in third-and-long situations?	Now talk.
Thank you "Football for Dummies."	What do you want me to talk about? The pros and cons of blitzing a weak-side quarter when you're in third-and-long situations?
And then I heard something I thought I'd never hear.	I mean, I met your father, I remember it like it was yesterday. After about two seconds I could tell how proud he was of you.
It's amazing how a few simple words can change everything.Whether it's an apology...	Me too.
... or an admission.	You too, sir.
Of course, sometimes it's not about the words...... it's just about having someone there to listen.	You're welcome.
And it's our dad, aand he's ranting and raving because he's an office supply salesman and he can't find a paper clip in the entire house.	Of course, sometimes it's not about the words...... it's just about having someone there to listen.
The trunk was filled with boxes of 'em!	Meanwhile, he gets to work the next morning, and he realises he's got a million of 'em in the trunk of his car.
One thing I've learned is to never play Operation against a surgeon for money.	Step aside! Ahh!
Ah-haa! Ha-haaa! Let's play again.	That depends, what are we talking about?
Oh, come on, if you do, I promise that every time I hit the buzzer I'll act like I'm getting electrocuted, like this:	No.
Turk's blood sugar was low because he has Type II diabetes and hasn't figured out his medication yet.	You want a cookie?
Mmmmm, Mulattos.	Turk's blood sugar was low because he has Type II diabetes and hasn't figured out his medication yet.
I always thought that was a little bigoted for a cookie.	They're Milanos, you idiot.
Cookie racism aside, I had bigger problems. It had been three weeks since our dad died, and my brother Dan was still staying with me.	I always thought that was a little bigoted for a cookie.
You bar tend three shifts a week.	Boy, nothing like a little time off to remind you how hard you been working, huh?
Since I had dumped Elliot and broke her heart, she couldn't really be there for me. But thankfully she was there for my brother.	Hey! Sorry I'm late.
Our dad's death.	I am now. You know, without Elliot, I never woulda gotten through my dad's death.
Oh, hellooo. Women are checking me out lately. Was it the ten push-ups I've been cranking out every other Sunday? Perhaps. More likely it was the pledge I made not to date anyone until Elliot did. See, since then, the gals have been all over me.	Mm.
I'm sorry, sugar, this store is closed.	Can I buy you a drink?
They've been all over me.	I'm sorry, sugar, this store is closed.
Very impressive, but I'm sorry.	They've been all over me.
The key to sleeping in the on-call room is to block out the noises around you like snoring, teeth-grinding, or even....	She doesn't know she's taking them.
...on-call room nookie. Hello, my old friend, how I've missed you.Yes, it does.Time out, male moaning! Party's over!	The key to sleeping in the on-call room is to block out the noises around you like snoring, teeth-grinding, or even....
Hey!Woooogh!	...on-call room nookie. Hello, my old friend, how I've missed you.Yes, it does.Time out, male moaning! Party's over!
I knew it was my turn to let Dan have it, but for some reason I wasn't mad.	Thanks, Coxy!
Listen, Dan	I knew it was my turn to let Dan have it, but for some reason I wasn't mad.
I'm okay with it.	J.D., let me explain. I came to the hospital to see you, and then I ran into Elliot and it just happened. It was a one-time thing.
Our dad.	Great, 'cause it's been going on for a few weeks. Elliot's amazing! Smart, funny...hhhot. I was in a dark place and she saved me, she really did. Haven't felt this good since my dad died.
How thoughtful!	Twice! But we didn't go under the sheets out of respect.
Oh my God! This could be my diabetes!	Thanks, sweetness!
Unless, God forbid, they find a cure.	Exactly. But you gotta use it before that window closes. Lucky for me, my diabetes window stays open 24/7.
Turk was right. Lying to Elliot was the perfect way to get our friendship back to normal.	Bye, folks. You'll notice I knocked a hundred dollars off the bill because of the, uh, you know, baby-stealing thing.
I wanna talk to you for a second! Can you turn that thing off?	Thanks for the loaner scooter, Johnny!
Look, when I caught you two yesterday, I didn't know what to say. But now I do. You really hurt me.	Sorry!
GUYS! THERE ARE SICK PEOPLE TRYING TO SLEEP!	Okie-dokie.
Well how would you feel if I hooked up with one of your siblings?	J.D., are you really this upset?
Barry?	A little confused considering I have four brothers. But not surprised. At you or Barry.
Well obviously you did, or you woulda told me about it from the beginning.	I guess I just didn't think I was doing anything wrong.
That one had to sting. I really wanna look back and see if it landed, but I'll have to go back to sad face first.Oh, it landed!	Well obviously you did, or you woulda told me about it from the beginning.
MY OWN BROTHER! WHY!?	Incoming, man.
No, I think I broke my hand.	You can stop now, she's gone.
There's nothing more satisfying than having a good plan.	No, I think I broke my hand.
Sometimes a plan can crystallize in a moment.	Goodnight, amigos.
And sometimes a plan can fall apart just as quickly.	Let's destroy her.
Of course, in my plan nobody gets hurt.	I know it's a dream job, but with your diabetes I think you need me more.
AAAAGGGHHH! What are you doing back in the tub!?	Hey, little brother.
...Except my brother.	Elliot dumped me.
That's not even the right gibberish!	No, J.D., I don't, because Elliot was the best thing that ever happened to me and now she's gone. Ahhhh...she's gone! She's gone. She's...gone! She's gone...she's gone.
Oh, come on, don't go. We can watch 'Kangaroo Jack' and chug a Foster's every time they say "g'day"!	You know what, J.D.? Elliot and I were supposed to have a big romantic evening together, and look at all this stuff I bought. Candles. Champagne. A Dido CD. I guess I'll just throw these things out with rest of the garbage.
Dan!	G'day, J.D.
You okay?	Let it go. It's done!
Hey! Let's not get crazy!	No. Sometimes I wish I'd never gotten this stupid diabetes!
This'll only take a second.Look, you know how I told you I was upset about you and Dan? Is that champagne?	Thanks, they're new!
I love champagne. You mind if I have a little? Thank you. A nipper!Ahh! Tingly! It's a tingly drink! Oooooh! Pretty candles! Anyhoo, I know you broke up with Dan because you thought I was upset, but in reality, I...uh...I... "I want to thank you! For giving me the best day of my life..." I love this song, who is it?	Yeah. Yeah, I was celebrating my...new jammies.
Dido?	Dido. And you've really got to meet my brother Barry.
Dan?	Look at all this stuff I bought. Candles. Champagne. A Dido CD.
AAGGHH!	Hey, little brother!
Elliot, I came here to tell you I was never actually mad at you.	J.D., Dan and I both know this is just a fling. Still, I feel like the worst person in the whole world. Please, can you forgive me?
I don't know. I just...wasn't.	How could you not be mad that I was hooking up with your brother?
That's when I realized that Elliot and I had absolutely no romantic feeling for each other anymore.No matter what the situation.It was a little sad, but, who knows? Maybe it meant we could be friends again.	I don't know I I just didn't.
If my heart could write songs, they'd sound like these.	Hey! I can't find my Dido CD!
I think relationships are inherently fragile. They can be strengthened by a shared excuse.	If my heart could write songs, they'd sound like these.
Others can be torn apart by the loss of a common enemy.	Of course not, baby!And now....it's bat-killing time!Wahow! Good lord!
Oh, goodnight, Dan. Sleep tight. There's a bus schedule underneath your pillow.	Well, goodnight, little bro.
And for Elliot and I...turns out all we needed was a little time.	Oh, goodnight, Dan. Sleep tight. There's a bus schedule underneath your pillow.
What was that for?	'Night, J.D.
The good news was this Elliot and Dan thing meant that I was back on the market!	What was that for?
Can I buy you a drink?	The good news was this Elliot and Dan thing meant that I was back on the market!
Yep! I'm back, baby!	No thanks.
More nuts, please.	Yep! I'm back, baby!
You ever get the feeling our patients pretend to be sicker when we're around?	Ohh!
You know, Elliot, since I broke your heart, I've held my tongue every time you've been a wiseacre. But now that you slept with my brother, we're even. So if you bring sarcasm my way, baby, prepare to be stung!	Oh, yeah. You know Mrs. Wilson back there? She made her spleen pretend to rupture, and then she pretended to die.Got me again, there, Mrs. Wilson!
So's your face.	J.D.
"So's your face" always makes sense.	That doesn't even make any sense.
So's your face! I'm on fire! Helloooo!	J.D., that's stupid.
Calm down, Twelve.	You actually rank the women of this hospital by their appearance?
I don't know, Elliot. Molly and I really aren't that close.	Yes, top twenty!
Okay, a lot happened between that moment and this one. I should explain.Elliot did end up throwing Molly a goodbye party.	I don't know, Elliot. Molly and I really aren't that close.
I was content to lay low and flirt in the corner. See, the most important thing about hospital get-togethers is to make sure you don't do anything people will be talking about the next day.	My nephew Ryan is so cute. He's six.
Will you excuse me a moment?AAAAGGGGHHHHH! PUT ME OUT! PUT ME OUT!	...goes through like the whole day that he's grown up! Oh my God, I love it.
OW! DOUG! WHY!? AAAGGGHHH!AAAGGGHHH! The sinks are broken! The sinks are broken! Hot! Hot! Hot, hot, hot, hot!So your nephew is six, huh? That's a crazy age!	All right! Stand back, everyone! I'll handle this!
After the fire marshal closed down the bar, we took the party back to our place.	OW! DOUG! WHY!? AAAGGGHHH!AAAGGGHHH! The sinks are broken! The sinks are broken! Hot! Hot! Hot, hot, hot, hot!So your nephew is six, huh? That's a crazy age!
Eventually things wound down. Some people went home....Some just went to bed....	Sorry I'm late. Player had a date. Anybody want some chocolate?
And that's how Molly and I ended up alone on the couch, watching that unbelievably romantic scene from '16 Candles'.No, not that one! This one.	'Night.
God bless Molly Ringwald. And this Molly. Ah, the hell with it! God bless Mollys everywhere!	Happy birthday, Samantha.
I gave her the ol' ice tongue. It's easy to do, you just have to be really smooth.	Weird. His tongue was freezing.
I'm telling you, Turk. Olive oil.	Ugh, I always hated ice tongue. And sometimes his lips seemed so greasy.
Oh, damn, I was afraid that was gonna get out. Does anybody else know that I totally made out with Molly? Up here!	She already told me, J.D.
Elliot, once you're even, you can't just go back to being not even. That ain't new, girl!	Now that you made out with my best friend, that makes us not even again. So go get me some cotton balls and a toe separator mama needs a pedicure! Heh.
Heh, yeah, now that we're friends and there's no chance of us ever having sex again, there's really not a whole lot I "need" from you, okay? So g'head and give it your best shot.	Admit we're not even or I'll make you pay.
Oh, no, did someone you know die from beer?	J.D., I have to tell you something.
Comin' at you, Shinski!People can die from beer, Molly. Shinski didn't, but our friendship did.	Hey, yo, J.D., toss me a beer, man.
You were saying?	J.D., you just don't have that edgy mean streak that I'm attracted to.
Sometimes all it takes is a slammin' hottie to make you dig down deep and discover who you really are.	Look, I'm sorry, but I'm attracted to damaged, dysfunctional people, and you're just too normal.
My emotional journey began at five years old when I walked in on my parents having sex in a position my father would later playfully describe as "the jackhammer." I have a mentor that verbally abuses me every chance he gets, and no matter how much I try, I can't stop constantly narrating my own life.	Sometimes all it takes is a slammin' hottie to make you dig down deep and discover who you really are.
At that very moment, I feared I had divulged too much.

I have a mentor that verbally abuses me every chance he gets, and no matter how much I try, I can't stop constantly narrating my own life.
Molly, I'm narcissistic, I'm pessimistic, I'm obsessive, I'm insecure. And I am so afraid of intimacy that every one of my relationships is a journey of self-sabotage that inevitably ends in a black vacuum of shattered expectations and despair.	At that very moment, I feared I had divulged too much.
Why would she lie?	I'll remember that.
Should we get out of here?	Why would she lie?
No. But you won't know until after.	D'you think you can handle it?
Just tell me who!	You just need to clear it with one person first.
That doesn't even make any sense!	No.
Dammit! Walked into that one!	So's your face!
I am sorry, but that is one thing that will never happen.Fine, we're not even.	It's simple, J.D.: I'll give you the OK if you just admit we're not even.
But Molly just left, so you have to call her at home!	Thank you.
Okay, Sasha, let's see what your new engine can do!	I'm not gonna do that. But, I will write you a note.
Where are my clothes?	Ears! Right! I'm not stupid!
Aw, Doug!	I sent them to the dry cleaners!
What are you doing!?	Then what are we waiting for. Get in.Come on! Let's go! Go, go, go, go!
Turk, it's me!	Hello?
Yes! It's good! You surgeons are idiots!	Hang on, I'm doing my diabetes test. Ninety eight, is that a good number?
I was treed by that coyote!	Sorry, dude. Where were you?
He took it.I can't run in this gown, it's too loose!	You got your phone?
I agree, but my legs are cramping!	I can't run in these jeans, they're too constricting!Yeah, this is much better!
I was kneeling on a nest!	You spent too much time crouching in that tree, didn't you!
That's perfect! That'll leave us five minutes to cuddle!Hi, is Molly here?	It's either...4G or 5G. J.D., this is ridiculous, it's 4 o'clock in the morning. Even if you catch her, she's leaving for the airport in like ten minutes.
Sorry, wrong apartment.Konichiwa.	It's not my wife, is it, Debbie?
Oh my God. I'll never get down there before she leaves! This is the worst moment of my life.	Dude, she's outside. She's about to get in the cab!
You're right. Gimme that gown!	Or is it the greatest moment of your life?
Hey, this isn't that scary. Uh-oh!	Go get her, buddy!
Molly!? Heey!	Hey, this isn't that scary. Uh-oh!
Well, maybe this'll change your mind.	I'm not sure that's a good idea.
Pretty well. Nice landing.	How's it going?
I think the easiest way to lose something is to want it too badly.	J.D., I think this note's for you.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!	Take care.
Of course, it doesn't help if your friend is a diabolical genius. Still, when you come across a person who's lost something that really matters, you have to answer the call.	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Okay, they're mad. I'm pretty sure it's because of my new girlfriend.You know, the funniest thing happened	May I have a pancake please?
Sorry. I'm starvin'. Wish I hadn't left my walletAlso, the sex could be a little impersonal.So that's a no on cuddling?Still, Turk and	I'm eating.
Nope.	Really? Then this won't hurt.
Why?After spreading half a tube of what I thought was burn	Hit him again baby.
Nothing. How can I help you?	What smells like Vagisil?
Elliot, you should never use scalding hot coffee for a victory sip.	Remember how I thought Mr. Peterson's back pain was sacroiliitis and
Over the past few months Eliot's come into her own as a	Oh yeah? Well you're ***so something something ***.
Of course around here, everybody's looking to prove	Attention staff: One of our hospital's board
Where do we go?	J.D., how could you do this to Turk? You two are so close that I
Oh, I hope it was summer. I'm not that big a skier.	One time we went to Aspen.
Fine. Turk, tell her our code.	Girls! I want an explanation.
Fine. But I'm only ending it because friends come first.	I want you to stop seeing her.
Four a half times! Lata!	Plus, you already had sex with her.
Hey Neena. God help	Hey, I want you
You can't just say no. No is the answer to a question. And I clearly	No.
Neena, it's over.	Tough day, huh? You wanna talk about it?
First of all, thank you. Secondly, I tried to be reasonable. Now if	No it's not. In fact, I find myself oddly turned on by your timid
Okay, fine, why don't you just tell me how this ends?	Yet another strong moment for you?
What is this, some kind of lawyer mind trick? It's not gonna happen!	You won't break up with me, you will betray your friend.
I won't, I'm leaving.	Sit down.
I'll do nothing of the sort.	You're going to have sex with me.
Oh, I hate a dirty table.	And as the ultimate act of betrayal, you will do it on the very same
God help me, I do. I do love a dirty table.	You love a dirty table.
You can only keep the truth hidden for so long.	You are so dead.
And when the truth comes out, it doesn't set you free as	Turk, wait! Let's sit down and talk about this.
Sure, Dr. Cox and I were feeling guilty. But if Turk	Hey Gandhi! Gandhi, I think we should talk. What do you say?
I know! Believe me, the whole time we were having sex I was thinking	What is the matter with you two? J.D., you said you were going to
Company! Misery loves company! Misery loves company...	Alright, look
My talk with Carla gave me the courage to take a stand.	Ah, yes. Yes yes. Well, your paper script looks good. But, I'm
Punish me? How?You know what, no, this is crazy. I am not going to get your nameAnd that's when I realized I would never be strong enough	If you talk about ending our relationship again, I'll punish you.
Jordan? I need you to break up with somebody for me.	Really?
Okay, this woman is horrifying, so don't panic.	I fear I've said too much.
I was talking to myself.	I'll be fine.
Okay.	Oh, there you are. Go get in the backseat of my car and lie down on
Oh, it's so on.	Neena, a word?
The thing about strong women... If you call them out,	You got something to say? Say it.
And just like that we all knew who had won.	You come in here and walk around like you're the queen bee. Guess
Yeah!	Ouch.
I'm free?	Okay. Fine, it's over.
Wow. Thanks, Jordan. I'll see you around.	Awesome.
Jordan's making me stretch out her new jeans.	Not so fast. You're my bitch now.
Turk, I'm sorry about Neena.	Hit you on the fly! Fifteen-love!
And the truth was, he did understand. No matter how much	It's okay, man. She's a woman. I understand.
Oh, no.	Well, what do we have here?
Makes everything seem more dramatic.	Practicing our slow motion run.
Go get her, Turk!	Baby?
Oh, he's slow.	Waaaaaaiiiiit!
Time to go see my favorite patient, Mr. Gregory Marks. He may need a new kidney, but he sure as hell doesn't need a new heart.	Oh, he's slow.
Oh, my God, a journal!	Hey, I bought you a present.
I can't wait to chronicle this one! Oh God!	Well, you seem like the kind of sensitive young buck that likes to chronicle his feelings.
I gotta tell you, Mr. Marks even though I know you'd never take it, I'd give you one of my kidneys in a second.	I can't wait to chronicle this one! Oh God!
Awesome. Well...let me check your chart and s-see if we're a match!	Oh, no, I would definitely take it! I would take it with my bare hands.
Please don't be a match! Please don't be a match! Blood type O! Not a match! Yes!! Yes!! Yes!! Yes!!	Awesome. Well...let me check your chart and s-see if we're a match!
I'm so sorry.	Please don't be a match! Please don't be a match! Blood type O! Not a match! Yes!! Yes!! Yes!! Yes!!
They had to trim them to get me out of that well.	Is it a set of adult male shoulders?
Anyway, know Mr. Marks? He said he doesn't have any family to be a kidney donor? But he's got a son! We gotta find this guy!	Oh, right.
Ah, that's a horse with a sword on his head, and he's there to guard my hopes and dreams.	Look, Newbie, there are times a man wants to keep something to himself. Like, say, he's got a son. Or he's 29-years-old and keeps a journal with a unicorn drawn on the cover?
Eventually someone's gonna miss me, Jerry!	Come on, if the guy didn't tell you about his son, I'm sure he had a pretty good reason. You know, you always do this you get too involved in your patients' lives. And just exactly how does that usually work out for ya?
After getting more involved, I found out Mr. Marks's son was an air-traffic controller at a small private airport.	Yeah, yeah. Look, Claudia: Just promise me you won't get too involved with your patient. Okay?
Excuse me, are you Murray Marks?	I'll tell you something about 'Wings' they really got it right.
You don't look busy.	I'm busy.
You can take that.	Yeah, you're right. I'm not busy.
Take it! TAKE IT!	Oh, God! We've lost the other engine!
Shouldn't you call the fire department or something!?!	Okay. Pull up, 117. Pull up.Hello?Hello?We lost 'em.
He smells like fuel.	He's a little off.
Yeah, that would be a whole lot funnier. But I have a question: Who's gonna be singing the "I found his son" song? Because it certainly won't be me! Okay?	Yeah, but okay, but wouldn't it be funnier if I came on the second "I found his son," just to get to it?
Dr. Cox...? You were wrong! I found his son, I found his son, I f	Whoa!
Gah!Reunion time. This is gonna be great.	We were on your scooter.
See?	Before you say anything, I just want you to know if you need a kidney, you can have mine.
All right, we what's the problem with your dad?	So close.
Oh, come on, no it isn't!	Well, for starters, he named me "Murray." That's an old man's name!
Murray!	MURRAY!Everything my father's ever done was designed to humiliate me.
No, the youngest Murray!	What.
Oh, come on, you're exaggerating.	Thirty-four!You don't know what it was like having him as a father. He had me in his shadows my whole life. He actually sang at my senior prom. My date threw her panties on the stage first and last time I saw them, by the way.
Shhh! I love this song.	See what I mean?
I can't keep my kidney guy's son from leaving.	Exactly!
No, they are.	Yeah, right.
Look, Murray, it doesn't matter that your father's handsome and charismatic and sings like a young Joan Baez. He's your flesh and blood, and you gotta step up.	Thank you...Glen.
He's dead.	Look, you obviously have some issues with your own father that you're projecting on to me. So why don't you go ahead and give him a jingle?
No, I'm serious.	Good stuff!
He had like a massive heart attack.	Classic!
Now, about the kidney....	I'm sorry for your loss.
Make the "flesh and blood" argument again but in a different way.	I wish I could fly my plane right now. I always like to fly it when I have to make a big decision.
Blood and flesh, Murray.	Make the "flesh and blood" argument again but in a different way.
Jackpot!	I'll do it!
One for the road, Glen?Thanks! Happy weekend!	Yawning, Glen!
"I told you so" moments are rare. So when they come, you have to savor them.	That's the way female doctors around here behave, I hope the young lady I'm interviewing is a different breed. Do either of you know where I can find Dr. Elliot Reid?
Oh, no.	Hey, Newbie! The good news is that Murray and his dad are a match, kidney-wise. The better news is that the test revealed a little secret you're gonna wanna share with your new pal. Gregory is not Murray's biological father!
Dammit!	By the by? This moment is so great, I'd cheat on that other moment from before, marry this one and raise a family of tiny little moments.
Uh, actually, sir, it's a horse with a sword on his head.	Go tell that little bastard this second, before he coughs a kidney up to his fake father and sues this hospital!
Well, Dr. Kels Well, Dr. Kelso, I'm just gonna tell him. Murray's got a good heart, and he'll do the right thing.	What are you going to do, son?
Murray!	I'm outta here!
Not you, Old Murray!	Whaaat?
Come on, I'm really asking for your help here.	Who gave you this number?
Fine! Maybe I got too involved like you said. But would it kill you for once to acknowledge that my heart is in the right place instead of spending all your time berating me?	Yeah, but, it's very important we focus on the whole "who gave you this number" issue.
You've been great as usual.There you are! Hi, buddy!	You got the number from Jordan, didn't you. She hates me.
What an odd sized explosion.	Hey...!Ohh, ohh! I'm a doctor! I'm a doctor! Everything can't get to me!
I'm not falling for that crap again!	Tower, are you there? I lost an engine!
Anyhoo, what do you think your dad is doing right now?	It's what I do.
Been there with my gram-gram....	He's not my dad, he's my fake dad. Which means what my fake cousin Samantha and I almost did in the tenth grade would have been beautiful...and right.
Sometimes Dr. Cox is all over me, like every second of my life.	No. Not ever.
Remember? Recently deceased dad?	Why do you keep talking about your boss like he's your father?
Yes! I mean, yes.	Massive heart attack!
In a hospital, it's easy to take things too far. Still, sometimes you have to go too far to see where the line is.	Dad. Dad!
As for me...	Huh!
...Maybe I got too involved with Murray and his fake real dad. But as I watched Gregory serenade a clearly uncomfortable Murray, I realized something.	Hey, good lookin'! Whaa'cha got cookin'...
If Murray could look past his dad's imperfections and appreciate all the time he'd given him, maybe I owe Dr. Cox a thank-you for the same thing.	Heeey, sweet baby! Dooon'cha think maybe...
Hey. I just wanted to take a second to thank you for constantly berating me, doubting my abilities, and the overall devastation of my self-esteem.	If Murray could look past his dad's imperfections and appreciate all the time he'd given him, maybe I owe Dr. Cox a thank-you for the same thing.
Now wrap it all up with a slow motion hand wave.Oh, I'm slooooow, baby.	My pleasure.
Why did I do it!?	I'm in the worst mood.
Shhhh!	Ohh, don't go behind the kidney, brotha!
Like a bear to honey.	You didn't go to the black family yelling at the movie screen stereotype, did you?
Buckle up, buddy!	Oh, don't worry. I gotcha.
Hey, kids, I'm Dr. Dorian. I'm sure you have lots of questions, so let's get started.So, basically it's a topical application consisting of equal parts triethanolamine and phenyl dimethicone. I suggest applying it twice a day for extra hold. Okay? Here's a sample tube, Reuben. Excellent query.Okay, then, anybody else?	Hell yeah!
I-I'd say my best moment was probably my second year, New Year's Eve. A young pregnant woman could barely make it into the hospital, she had her baby right there on the ramp.	What was your best moment in medicine?
You know what'd be really neat? If you guys all took a second and thought about what your best moment in medicine was.It woulda been neat.	Oh, yeah.
Sure....	Hey! You brought Tyler a new ice cream cone!
It's a waffle cone.	Thanks.
There are other ways you can get it.Dr. Cox.	Don't you get that from kissing?
You'll beat Santa home. I promise.	Am I gonna get out of here in time for Christmas? Tyler's mom isn't around anymore, and I'd really hate to ship him off to his grandparents'.
Agh!That's one more point for Mrs. Cross. But let's see how she enjoys her beloved hard candy without ... her choppers!	Phyllis. Outside.What the hell was that in there?
Mr. Milligan? His blood pressure's a little low; he just has mono.	Newbie! You never promise a patient that they're gonna be fine!
I did feel it. And I knew what Carla was gonna say before she said it.	Oh, for God's sakes, Newbie, take a look around, would you please? What's the difference between your Mr. Milligan and every other patient in this I.C.U.? And if the answer to that question is that he's the only one young enough to have never made a phone call like this: "Brring! Hello? Operator? Give me ," then you'd be right. But since I'm not in the mood to make some big, dramatic, sweeping statement, I'll just tell you this: God hates doctors, He truly does. You see all these old people in here? Well, any of 'em would give just about anything to be able to sashay off this planet, but most of 'em are gonna stay and they're gonna live forever and ever and ever. And your Mr. Milligan, well, it turns out he's just young enough to die. I mean, think about it: It's the holidays, there's a sweet little kid involved. Can't you just feel it?
I already ordered it.	Well, I'd scan his head.
That I will not do!	Well, I'd definitely give Mrs. Cross her teeth back.
Turk! Hey! If you go talk to Kelso for me, I'll give you this special Christmas gum.	Hey, J.D. Turns out Mr. Milligan doesn't have insurance. Dr. Kelso said once he's stable we have to bounce him to County.
Okay, this is actually Mrs. Cross's medicated denture gum? So you have to sell it with your eyes. Sell it.... Sell it...!	Turk! Hey! If you go talk to Kelso for me, I'll give you this special Christmas gum.
They came back negative. I feel like we're missing something in his patient history.	Did you get the results of the scan?
We should also check him for the silly-willies.	Oh my God, he just might have goof-arounditis.
I'm kidding. Enough of the backseat doctoring I got this.	What?!
Why does it seem like every time I take a stand, everything turns to crap?	I'm kidding. Enough of the backseat doctoring I got this.
I'm sorry, what?	I gave that kid some money and sent him outside the hospital, and now I can't find him.
You gotta be kidding me.	Kelso said, no insurance, you gotta stabilize the guy and then bounce him.
Why are you sick?	I'll tell you what, in about ten more minutes none of this is gonna matter, because this guy's circling the drain.
You know, try and discourage me all you want, because kites fly highest against the wind.	Or maybe we could just fill a syringe with false promises and inject him with that. Hm! Says here you already got that one covered!
I'm a kite! I'm a big, beautiful kite! Fly!	What?
Kids can kick pretty hard. Maybe he ruptured his spleen?	Wrestling.Remember? He said his kid dropped him with a power kick.
What the hell are you doing?	It's Beardfacé!
Come on, it turns out Mr. Milligan has a ruptured spleen. We're prepping him for surgery in room C.	I got gummed.
So?	That's the room where the family gets to observe.
So you think you're a robot mechanic?	So, dude, you don't understand. When I operate, I don't see a person, I see a machine with parts that need to be replaced and circuits that need to be rewired.
Well, I wouldn't worry about that. Mr. Milligan only has a son and Elliot lost him.	As a surgeon, the more detached I am, the more focused I am. And it's pretty impossible to feel focused or detached when this guy's family's watching every move I make.
Ah.	Awesome! For me.
None of us wanted to say what we were thinking: How vulnerable we felt. So we all just stood around, pretending to work, and waited for someone to come through that door and tell us how this was gonna end.	Dr. Turk? Thanks.
All right, you guys, we still got a lot of work to do. Turk, why don't you go check the post-op films in radiology; and Carla will transfuse back to a hemoglobin ten; and Elliot, why don't you take Tyler and go get us all ice cream immediately.I'm gonna go check on him. You wanna come?	Who's the man!
It's amazing how one patient can affect so many people.	No. No, you got it.
My best moment...? Well, there was this guy...	Dr. Dorian? What was your best moment in medicine?
...and I kept my promise. Because the two of them got home in time for Christmas. And that was my best moment in medicine.	...and honest to God, I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it myself, but Newbie handled the whole thing wire to wire...
Co-chiefy, got you a little som'n-som'n!	Good morning!
A magnifying glass?	Thank you! And I actually got you a little something....
You got the tiny post-its! Aww, awesome! For our tiny bulletin board! Aaaand I have a dentist appointment that got moved to Tuesday at 4 PM. "Don't floss before you come in, it makes your gums bloody"! Aww!	Yes.... For these.
Bottom line together, Elliot and I are the greatest co-chief residents of all time.	You got the tiny post-its! Aww, awesome! For our tiny bulletin board! Aaaand I have a dentist appointment that got moved to Tuesday at 4 PM. "Don't floss before you come in, it makes your gums bloody"! Aww!
Cream?	You two are, without a doubt, the worst co-chief residents of all time. And in case you haven't noticed, we've got ourselves one hospital chock-full of monkey interns; and, news-flash, your job is to catch whatever they're flinging. Coffee talk, ladies, is now officially over. Get your asses to work. Now.
Yep, not even Dr. Cox could faze us. Because we had every facet of this job down.We figured out a fair way to schedule all the interns' shifts....	Please!
Okay, whoever gets Dr. Reid's scrub top back to her first doesn't have to work this weekend! Commence the scuffle!	Yep, not even Dr. Cox could faze us. Because we had every facet of this job down.We figured out a fair way to schedule all the interns' shifts....
Me too.	I hope it doesn't rain today.
We knew how to protect the interns from Dr. Kelso.	Ow! My lip!
sake, Brent! When are you gonna wake up and use that	Look, Brent, is it? Son, please tell me you come with a money back guarantee, because I'd like to get something useful like a can of Brent remover! I mean, for God's sa
We got this.	rock that you have been calling your skull?!
He's gone. He's gone.	I mean, even a blind squirrel occasionally finds a nut! And
Still, it's not like we didn't keep the interns on their toes.	Heh, look, Brent, you are doing fine.
So, Lonnie, get in here and see the effects of cirrhosis of the liver.	Still, it's not like we didn't keep the interns on their toes.
But it was still very startling!	J.D.! You knew I was gonna do that!
Oh, Daisy, I'm supposed to ask you can Lonnie have his lower lip back?	Wow, Daisy! Enjoy your weekend, you little scrapper!
Don't get me wrong, I can handle a code. But every so often, every single thing that can conceivably go wrong with a patient goes wrong at once.	Hey, this guy's coding.
Okay, just gimme a second, all right?	He's blown a pupil.
I call these "train wreck codes," and they're not my forte.	Okay, just gimme a second, all right?
I honestly didn't understand how she could do so many things at once.	J.D., I've got your back. Laverne, bolus with amiodarone, get me the crash cart, grab me a central line kit, I'll bag him. Run the fluids wide open.
Toto!T-O-T-O Toto.	14 Across: Four letters, "Band that sang 'Roseanna'"?
See, my problem is that I've just never been much of a multi-tasker. For instance, I can't eat and watch T.V. Or drive my scooter and answer my phone.	Okay, he's stable.
Hello?Whooooa! Oh God, oh God! Look out, look out, look out, look out, look out!	See, my problem is that I've just never been much of a multi-tasker. For instance, I can't eat and watch T.V. Or drive my scooter and answer my phone.
Look out, lady! Look out! Look out!	Agh!
Look out!	What the?
Scared Lonnie again!	Look out!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!	Scared Lonnie again!
Tater tot!	Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoooooooooooaaaaaaaaaa!Whoever this is, you are not gonna believe what just happened to me!	Over here! I'll get you back outside!
Janitor. Ambrosia!	No, I believe it. It was cool.
Classic Janitor!	Mm-hmm.
See, this is why it doesn't bother me that Elliot is so much better with the train wreck codes. Her biggest weakness is my biggest strength diagnosis.	Tests? Oh , goody! And what exactly will you be looking for? And if it's the slowest doctor in the hospital, then ding! ding! ding! ding! I already found her. Figure it out.
Elliot, if you need help, just ask Dr. Diagnosis. You could be my side-kick! Bangs McCoy!	See, this is why it doesn't bother me that Elliot is so much better with the train wreck codes. Her biggest weakness is my biggest strength diagnosis.
Low and slow, that's his tempo!	I want high.
That's what we were gonna name our robot!	I'm gonna name him Gizmo.
"TuPac, may I please have some waffles?" "Would you like some sy-rup?" Yeah, that'd be fine. It'll work. It's a good idea.	Oh, well, when we get the robot, we'll just name him TuPac.
I don't think so. You see, the packets are neatly stacked. Plus that coffee cup has the lipstick of a certain very hot Nurse Tisdale.	Somebody probably knocked them over.
It's the classic Todd Thong Sugar Trap.	If you're looking for sugar, there's some on the floor.Thonnnnnnng!
Now, let's apply the same thing to Mrs. Kasuba. We know this isn't the first time she's experienced abdominal pain. What else do we know about her?	Wow.
Yeah, I got this.	Oh, you know what, J.D.? Um, I've gotta run. Are you okay here?
Don't feel weird because you're threatened by my gift. Many are.	Say, that was some real Nancy Drew stuff, there...Nancy. I mean, absolutely irrelevant as far as medicine goes, but damn amusing!
Well, you're the number one jealous...weight for the jealous weight... jealous ch-champ.	Did you feel that you weren't quite annoying enough without adding a delusional sense of grandeur? Because I promise you, you are annoying enough. In fact, you're the number one contender for the middle weight annoyance crown.
You are a close second!	He's done it! He's done it! Dorian's the Most! Annoying! Man in the World! Who would've ever thought a journeyman annoyer like Dorian might....
I can't. I've almost got Mrs. Kasuba's condition figured out.	J.D.! You up for some coffee?
What was he gluing?Not again.I can't believe you're going on a date with the Janitor!	I'll be there. Just let me wash this, uh, glue off my hands.
Acute intermittent porphyria! I figured it out! All right, who's got Dr. Cox's pager number?Oh, who'm I kidding, I've got my Perry's Pager Song.	I think it, and she does it!
"Dr. Cox at my door, pager 324."	Acute intermittent porphyria! I figured it out! All right, who's got Dr. Cox's pager number?Oh, who'm I kidding, I've got my Perry's Pager Song.
There it is. Laverne, I'm gonna need you to get Mrs. Kasuba started on IV dextrose and hemotin.	"Dr. Cox at my door, pager 324."
She what?	Dr. Reid already ordered that.
She figured it out before me.	Um, you know what, J.D., I've gotta run. Are you okay here?
There are a lot of things that can knock a guy on his ass.	She figured it out before me.
Whether it's catching a glimpse of what the future might hold....	All right now, before we start, just in case my wife asks and she probably will what did this guy do to get his foot cut off?
Or realizing you've just done the most embarrassing thing in your life.	He has diabetes.
But even that's not as bad as it can get.	Stupid Janitor. Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid.
Why didn't you tell me?	But even that's not as bad as it can get.
The worst thing is realizing when a friend is taking pity on you.	Well, then, nice job, Nancy.
That's why I knew it'd be better for me if I just fessed up to Dr. Cox.	Lookin' straight, Bruce.
Elliot diagnosed Mrs. Kasuba, not me.	That's why I knew it'd be better for me if I just fessed up to Dr. Cox.
I don't get it. When did she become a better doctor than me?	I know. And your guilty anguish is it's delicious. It's like a little mini-meal between lunch and dinner. Quite frankly, it's all I can do not to grind pepper on your head.
Eh! As soon as I step foot in this hospital, I'm all business.Good morning, Dr. Cox! From the world's most giant doctor!Well, that was outside the hospital. Plus, Elliot was the legs. Sure, she's skinny, but she's thick through the trunk.	Probably during one of those countless times you were goofing off?
Those aren't real guns.	You're finally at that stage where you and your equally undistinguished colleagues have all had enough training to be able to help each other. So no matter how humiliating it may seem, if you know somebody who's better than you and I'm bettin' that you do? you had best tuck that ridiculously feminine tail of yours between your legs and go ask her for help. I'm thinkin' that's just about it. Yep. I, uh, gosh, I'm all out of speeches. I don't think I have, uh, another one on me. I...I don't. The Oh. These are...my goodbye guns.
Dammit!	His O2-sat is dropping, his abdomen is distended, we need you to do a lavage. What are you gonna do?
And how come when we walked in you were sitting in a circle with three corpses playing Texas hold 'em?	He keeps it cold!
I just, I don't know what to do when everything goes wrong at once. It's it's it's overwhelming.	Just call first from now on!
That's your big secret? Breathing?	You wanna know what my big secret is? Just take one big breath. Everything will slow down and you can just tackle each thing as it comes.
It's just that you're a little smug.	Why do you have such a problem with me teaching you stuff?
Because you're the one that's supposed to struggle not me.	You called yourself Dr. Diagnosis and made me your side-kick. J.D., you've been the golden boy around here for the past three years while I have cried in closets and hid from Dr. Cox and relied on you every single day to get me through it. I mean, now that I am finally doing well enough to pay you back, maybe you can tell me why you're being such an unbelievable jerk?
Uhhh....	He's becoming bradycardic.Doctor!
And things did slow down.	Uhhh....
To you!	I think the second you stop fighting it, time really is on your side.And you can go on being who you are.Or keep enjoying that little crush of yours.
Oh, Elliot, that's impossible. I mean, I know you've got strong legs, and you're	Cheers!
Greetings! Ha ha! Ha ha! I'm the world's most, most giant doctor! Whoa!	I need you to place an IV on the second floor, room 208.
Little help? Little help!	Oh!
Yeah, sure. Not that kind of help. Agh.If I let go, will you guys catch me?Well, I'm going for it anyway!Lonnie? Lonnie!	Sure, sure, sure.
Of course.	I'm here because I stepped on a nail.
Were you walking on your nose?	Of course.
Unfortunately you're gonna have to wait a little bit longer, okay? 'Cause we admit people by severity of condition.That was mortifying.	Were you walking on your nose?
You know, with the face burns we could probably admit you now. Laverne?Agh!	AAAAGGGGHHH! MY FACE! OWWWWWW! Owowowowowowow!
My "me time" hand!	You know, with the face burns we could probably admit you now. Laverne?Agh!
Carla and Elliot were going through their weekly ritual of making plans they were never going to keep.	We can go right after....
And since Turk knew these were fake plans, he used the opportunity to score bonus points with his wife. Classic husbanding.	Perfect!
To be perfectly honest, so did I. I never get an opportunity to wear my houndstooth sports coat.	I love it. I love it. It's awesome. It's awesome!
Let's do it.	It's 10 o'clock. You ready?
But lately for us, our plans rarely involved leaving the apartment.	Let's do it.
Mm-hmm.	I wasn't too excited about taking over this spot after you sat in it for twenty minutes, but I gotta tell ya, it's warm in all the right places.
Oh, man, your ass indentation is so deep, it's like I'm sitting in a giant inner tube.	How do you like what I left you over there?
As Turk and I recuperated from our big chair swap, I wondered what other couples were doing tonight. Did I just refer to Turk and I as a couple? My point is, I'm sure other couples were out having fun.	Oh, man, your ass indentation is so deep, it's like I'm sitting in a giant inner tube.
I guess some people figure, What's the worst that can happen?	Whatta you say we head into the bathroom of this place and lower the health code rating from an A to a B? Whatta you say?
I think I'll try to ask Turk something telepathically.	For the last time, Jerry, you're not dead! Okay? Now go back to your room!Jerry has Cotard's, or "walking corpse," Syndrome. The guy thinks he's dead even though he's walking around.
I think I used the last of it to make our special party ice.	Dude, yeah. Let's hang out and watch some TV. We got any beer?
Aw, man.And you must be the Irish brother.	I mean his sibling.
Probably not. We don't usually do that.	Only takin' the piss out of you, lads. Name's Billy Calahan. Had you goin' with the American accent, though, didn't I?
Oh, then perhaps you're not really Irish.	For the last time, lads: no.
See! I told ya!He's Irish!	FINE! Pink hearts, yellow moons, orange stars, green clovers.
Ohh, no, man, we're just living together. And not like, like, livin' together, I mean, like, liiiivin' together!	How long're you two seeing each other? You're a great couple.
Oh, why "alias"?	Oh, yeah, I got this, I snuck onto a plane, thought it was going to Belgium, ended up in Kenya. Long story short, I hung out with this tribe; when the males go through adolescence, they get this tattoo. It means "alias."
Do you have any sevens?Turk!You have lots of sevens!We tear it.	It's their favorite show.I'm only kiddin'. I don't know what it means.Enough about me. What about you lads, you know, saving lives here all day every day? Out at night, givin' out a lash, tearin' it up? You do go out at night, don't ya?
It's less tearing and more folding.	And and and sometimes lash, but with the hours we work, it's....
Gently folding.	Right.
Done it! Done that. That one I've done.	Lads! You're sleepin' off and you're dead and buried. You have to get out in the streets, you have to talk to a stranger. Drink a beer with breakfast! Take the ugliest girl home at the party!
"You'll be surprised what'll fall in your lap if you open up and embrace life..."	Go travelin' to Texas, you know? Go line dancing with some married women that wish they weren't married. You never know what life would put in your lap when you open your arms and embrace it!
Elliot!	Dude.
That happened very quickly.	He said my eyes look like the Irish countryside after a soft rain. Ahem. I should go.
Dude.	Don't even sweat it. It's Elliot. She's desperate!
In life, we often make assumptions that aren't true.Whether it's assuming you know how someone's gonna react...	Oh, he's not me brother. Sure'n I only met the fellow last night, God bless him.
...Or assuming that a little girl from Connecticut would never fight dirty.	Whatever makes you happy, sweetie. See you at home.
The crazy thing is most assumptions could be avoided if you just asked a simple question in the first place.	I'm going in!
Well, if you're not his brother, then who are you?	The crazy thing is most assumptions could be avoided if you just asked a simple question in the first place.
Well, then, you're gonna have to deal with me and my partner.I mean, like, my my partner, not like my my partner.	Lads, it was an accident, right? He threw the first punch, then I hit him, he slipped, hit his head on the bar. Now, listen, where I come from, you knock someone unconscious, you stay around, you make sure they're okay. Right? So, guess what? I won't be leaving.
No, dude, forget them. We have to deal with Billy. Now, should we call the cops on this guy or what?	Baby
He put a guy in the hospital; that's a felony. And as doctors we're supposed to report him.	I don't know, man, he seems cool.
No! This is a decision we both need to make! Together! As a team, as a unit!	Are you trying to convince me to do something that you already did? 'Cause you know that drives me crazy!
Thank God.	All right, fine, let's call the cops.
"Turk"'s easier to hear over the phone.	Hello, gentlemen. We got a call about a felony from a Dr. Turk?
"Dorian" isn't hard to hear over the phone. But I didn't really want to talk about it with Turk.	"Turk"'s easier to hear over the phone.
I know we feel guilty, okay? But it's over. It's not like there's gonna be any ramifications.	Ohh, man!
What the hell happened?	I warned ya!
Aaaaaaaghgggghhhhhhh!Ohh, you think scaring people's funny, huh?! Well, good! Because you're dying!	BOO!
Well, he started it!	John Dorian, you are a doctor!
Well, hey, we're sorry about the whole incarceration thing.	Her apartment's two blocks away. It should be no problem at all.
Dead people don't talk, Jerry.	When I was alive, I wish I had lived one day like he lives every day of his life.
We weren't really mad at Jerry, what we realized was that we were jealous of Billy, because he was out living life and Turk and I weren't.Whether it's appreciating your relationships...	Dead people don't talk, Jerry.
Or renewing your friendships.	Hey, doc! Zip it, grip it, and snip it!
For Turk and I, it was important just to get out and start living life, period.	I almost peed!
I know, but how often do we do this?	Buddy, it is almost one o'clock in the morning, and we have to be at work at five.
Uh, no. Go fish, please.Do you have any Ks?	You're absolutely right, come on.Do you have any twos?
You guys, I am so excited about tonight.	Noooo! NO!
No, Carla, an African-American club.	Settle down, we're just going to a nightclub.
In Turk's defense, we had tried this once before.	Promise me you'll be cool.
You can't touch me.	In Turk's defense, we had tried this once before.
And once before that.	You can't touch me.
Yeeeeeaaaaah, booooooy!Man, it's only ten o'clock.	And once before that.
But, hey, third time's the charm.	Yeeeeeaaaaah, booooooy!Man, it's only ten o'clock.
Word.	All right, you three can go in.
After two hours of intense roboting, I was parched.	Just don't lose your head, Bambi!Turk! J.D.'s doing theHeh. Oh, God.
Oh my God, that's a sign. If only she had my goofy sense of humor.	I hope so, it's my favorite drink.
Okay, time to move in for the kill. Work the fact that you're a doctor into the conversation. Just be subtle.	Ran out of vodka. Let me go downstairs and get some more.I been working on my fake stair walk.
I'm a doctor. Uh, John Dorian. Most of my patients live.	Okay, time to move in for the kill. Work the fact that you're a doctor into the conversation. Just be subtle.
My God, look at those beautiful eyes. They're so big I can see myself in them. Wow, how cute am I!	This is so weird! I been looking for a doctor! See...
You got it! Come by Sacred Heart tomorrow, I have clinic hours. After all, I'm a doctor.	...so it's probably nothing big, but I'm wondering if you could check it out?
I gotta thank you for taking a special interest in this.	Dude, I can't believe this. You're gonna date a patient! I hope she has something that keeps her here for a while so you can get to know her.
Do you ever get that special fluttery feeling in your heart when you feel like a woman is about to change your life?	Right, and I'm not straight.
The fluttering has stopped.	How's your heart?
It's funny, I thought you said you were the one who needed a doctor.	Thanks, doc!
Ohh. How could I not have heard that?	No, I told you it was James.
My God, look at those beautiful eyes. They're so bi You're doing it again!	Remember, I said...
Okay. In there, I'll see you.Oh man, I can't believe it's over.	...so, I'll see you in there.
I got this: Baby, you know you're his world!	Mm-hmm.
That moth is crazy!Hey, I heard a great joke. A guy walks into a dentist's office and says, "I think I'm a moth." And the dentist says, "Well, if you think you're a moth, why are you at a dentist's office?"	Dude? A guy walks into a dentist's office and says, "I think I'm a moth." The dentist then says, "Well, if you think you're a moth, why'd you come to the dentist's office?" The guy then says, "Well, the light was on."
Oh, no, I forgot the punchline.... You can't bail out now! Stall! Stall!	That moth is crazy!Hey, I heard a great joke. A guy walks into a dentist's office and says, "I think I'm a moth." And the dentist says, "Well, if you think you're a moth, why are you at a dentist's office?"
...So the moth says..."That's a good question. What kind of dentist are you?" And the dentist says, "Well, I'm a general dentist, but I...I do dabble in orthodontry braces and such." And...and the moth says, "Orthodontry? I hear there's great money in that."	Oh, no, I forgot the punchline.... You can't bail out now! Stall! Stall!
"The light was on"!	...So the moth says..."That's a good question. What kind of dentist are you?" And the dentist says, "Well, I'm a general dentist, but I...I do dabble in orthodontry braces and such." And...and the moth says, "Orthodontry? I hear there's great money in that."
"But! To answer your original question, which was, if I think I'm a moth, why am I in a dentist's office? The answer is, Because the light was on!"The light! The light, James. Moths love light.	"The light was on"!
Okay, well, uh, let's get a little history on you.	Mm.
Time to go fishing for some info.	Okay, well, uh, let's get a little history on you.
Do you ever have any, uh, shortness of breath? For instance when you're walking Kylie to the apartment that you share?	Time to go fishing for some info.
Window! Window!	We don't live together.
Oh, so you're you're waiting until you get married?	Window! Window!
Well, maybe that's from dragging your feet! Am I right, Kylie! Heh. She knows! Okay.	To answer your question, I don't have any shortness of breath. But my right knee is a little puffy.
Using patient histories to your advantage is an old doctor trick. Let's face it: What a doctor says and what they mean are often two different things.	Well, maybe that's from dragging your feet! Am I right, Kylie! Heh. She knows! Okay.
Don't need to, buddy I got a tube of Ben-Gay on each one of my hamstrings.	It loosens up my chest. But you should probably stretch too.
They're okay. Is there some special way to get a black girl to like you?	How things going with Kylie?
Uh-huh?	Dude, the only difference between a black girl and a white girl is that when a black girl asks you if her ass looks big?
All right!	You say, "Hell yeah!"
Hell, yes!	Okay! You wanna play some ball?
Give her a compliment. Tell her she has a huge ass!	Wow.
You	Give her a compliment. Tell her she has a huge ass!
Oh, this, it's a little embarrassing. I was playing baske	What happened to your eye?
Yeah. I ally-ooped him.	Embarrassing for me, actually, see....
Did-did-did the soup kitchen where I volunteer have a message?	Get outta here!
Thank you. Your test results, let's see what's going on.	Hell, no! Sweetie ain't drinking no cafeteria coffee! Sweetie, you are drinking the coffee from the doctors' lounge!Let's. Seton Hall, huh? That is...
Well, we should probably get get you fixed up, or things might start falling off of ya.	Oh, no, we haven't slept together...yet. It's not like I'm missing out shoot, I probably got it from my secretary. Or that trainer from the gym. Ooh, or this fine chick, Tamyra, that bartends with Kylie? Yeah.
What drives people to go back on their word?	Unfortunately, with his system failing, Dr. Reid and I have agreed there's nothing more we can do.
And what do you do when every fiber of your being wants to say something, but you know you can't?	Now, you have to keep this between us you know, doctor-patient confidentiality, right?
Nothin'!	Hey! What are you guys talking about?
Yes there is!	Is...there an "A"?
There may be a way around it....	Yes!
There's no rush. Uh, a nurse is up there right now getting some blood from him.	Mm-hmm. This is why doctors should have tip jars. I mean, I make three bucks for serving a martini, you put your lips on the mouth of a slobbering dead guy and bring him back to life that's gotta be worth at least a five spot!I...should be getting back to James.
You can bartend online?	Ugh, I shoulda brought my laptop I could've gotten so much work done.
Mm.	I just work at the club to pay for grad school.
I love politics! Ask me anything!	I'm getting my Masters in political science.
What are you doing?! You don't know anything about politics! You're screwed unless she asks about Bush or the bald assistant president who has all those heart attacks!	I love politics! Ask me anything!
You can vote if you're under twenty-five?	Did you know only seventeen percent of people under the age of twenty-five voted last year?
The only thing you can take solace in is that a girl like her would probably never be interested in you anyway.	You can vote if you're under twenty-five?
Would you like to play a game of Hangman?	I can't believe a cute guy like you doesn't have a girlfriend. If I was single, I'd totally snatch you up.
Why are you so happy?	Are you on Glornak Seven?
Well, he woke up to a world of bad boyfriends, oaths, and gonorrhea.	I just did an exchange transfusion on my malaria patient in there, and he just woke up on from his coma.
Sometimes you have to break the rules. And Elliot's patient waking up was a clear sign that you couldn't deny.	He sure did. And you know why? Because I broke the rules and ignored what Dr. Kelso wanted me to do.
Signs be damned! I'm telling her!	Mr. Chang is crashing!
Kylie! Kylie!	Signs be damned! I'm telling her!
Who cares! I'd make more money bartending!	Dude! You can't tell her! They won't let you be a doctor anymore!
Hey, Kylie, there you are.	I get to have sex tonight!
This is your moment! Grab it!	Hey! J.D.!
And there it was. Great doctors don't break oaths.	I wanted to thank you for being such a great doctor.
Someone once said the bad guys always win. Sometimes the bad guy is a jerk boyfriend.	Thanks again. For everything.
Sometimes the bad guy is the man you've been battling with for as long as you can remember.	It's finally here! The long-awaited showdown between Shaq and Kobe!
And sometimes the bad guy is a disease that you didn't stand a chance against.	Is this homemade gravy? Mmm!
I guess all you can do is come back to work the next morning and hope that being a good guy pays off.	I am so sorry.
What are you doing here?	I guess all you can do is come back to work the next morning and hope that being a good guy pays off.
Gonorrhea! I mean...gonorrhea.	My girlfriend Tamyra, from the club? She's also feeling a little sick, and you'll never guess what she has.
Your boyfriend is a jerk.	You could tell me now.
Oh, thank god. I-I-I could have sworn I heard the word jowly.	We like it.
Not too many.	So, uh...heh. How many outfits did you try on before you picked that one?
But the entire ensemble works together, and the jacket never comes off.	I don't think you do.
It'll be awesome.Sorry about your hair.	The top won't go up.
What the hell was that?	Don't beat yourself up. I got a scrunchie.There!
It was Sophie's Choice. Either heartlessly leave the possum there to die or wrap that little guy up in my sports coat and reveal the short-sleeved nerd jersey that lurked beneath.	It's a poor little possum! We should take him to the vet!
Careful. His, uh, little hoof is bleeding on the gear shift.	It was Sophie's Choice. Either heartlessly leave the possum there to die or wrap that little guy up in my sports coat and reveal the short-sleeved nerd jersey that lurked beneath.
A hundred and twenty dollars for a stupid dead rat!?	Yeah, this thing's dead. That'll be a hundred-twenty dollars.
I'll always remember him. Little Carlton.Anyway, we only lost about a half hour. We can still make that reservation!Oh, there's possums everywhere!	I think it's so sweet that you're depressed about that poor little possum.
Great!	No, no no no. It's just a box.A...talking box.I think your shirt stopped the bleeding.
Nurse? Do me a favor, please bandage this gentleman up, little bit...fix him up.	Outstanding.
I think they sensed that my first date wasn't going perfectly; and even though I could smell face cake in the air, it was about to get worse.	Nurse? Do me a favor, please bandage this gentleman up, little bit...fix him up.
The ex-girlfriend from hell.	Dr. Dorkian, I presume?
Danni, love to stay and talk, but I'm giving Kylie here a tour of the I.C.U.	The ex-girlfriend from hell.
After the tour! What is it with you and the underpass?	Hey. Hey, hey! You were gonna take me back to the underpass!
Thanks for the shirt, Lonnie.	So what? You're the one wearing it.
Good lord! That's a one-day mustache?	Are you doing this because I forgot to shave this morning?
No, Lonnie.It's so great, because the residents are practically our slaves.	Good lord! That's a one-day mustache?
Aggghhh! I just said "slaves" to my new black girlfriend!	No, Lonnie.It's so great, because the residents are practically our slaves.
Well, let's see. "Fatigue, fever, malaise." Have you been to Hong Kong, sir?	Unfreeze, J.D. It's over.
And then I said something stupid.	Yeah...?
Could be SARS.	And then I said something stupid.
I forgot that if any doctor suspects SARS, it's cause for immediate quarantine lockdown.	Could be SARS.
So be honest is this the worst first date you've ever been on or what?	Yeah you did!
Say no more. Lonnie, shirt!	I don't know. I think it's kind of exciting...being in a hospital, getting to see you in action. I just wish I could be your assistant.
Don't make me say pants. I'll do it.Still tanning, I see.	No!
Yeah.	He's your bitch, isn't he?
It's a front. She's miserable. So far the highlight of the night's been putting the possum to sleep and that's not a euphemism.	So, Kylie looks like she's having fun.
Well, you need a chart.	So what first, doctor?
You look ridiculous.	Lonnie! Chart!
Except for that glorious mustache.	You look ridiculous.
WHAT!?	I want more money.
I don't have it!	Fifty bucks or I tell the girl.
Elliot, I need another doctor over here, stat!	Get it!
Gimme thirty dollars.	Yeah?
I need a dermatologist over here, stat!	I gave you twenty, I'm tapped!
Look, I paid this guy to fake a heart attack. He wants fifty bucks, we only have twenty.	Oh yeah! Time to shine!
You have a trust fund! Now gimme the money!	You know, I feel like you guys just use me for my money.
CLEAR!	Ehhh!
J.D., one Lord, zero.	I'm alive!
Just like that, love was in the air. It was as if our first date got other people talking about some of theirs.	J.D., one Lord, zero.
I could hear the pain in my best friend's voice, and I could feel how little I cared...because by the way Kylie was looking at me, I knew she thought I was sexy.	NOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Here it comes sexy!	You know something? Seeing you in your element today, you seem so...
She would have said sexy if I had a mustache.	Genuine.
Cool.	You know, James lied all the time, and I don't know...it's just nice to be with a guy I can trust.
Oh, no.	Cool.
I see what you're saying! There's no downside! Kylie!	So, you just tell her the truth, she's mad at you for a little while, and then she forgives ya.
...That's peculiar...	Say I'm Glenn!
I barely know her.	Ugh! That's exactly the kind of girl my ex-boyfriend would have dated.
And the lies begin again.	I barely know her.
I certainly would never sleep with her.	And the lies begin again.
That's it you're stronger than this. Not another lie!	I certainly would never sleep with her.
I race motorcycles.Excuse me.What the hell are you doing?	That's it you're stronger than this. Not another lie!
For what?	I need more cash.
Fine! But know this: you've been nothing but a disappointment to me since the moment I ran over you.	I'm puttin' DSL in my box.
Thanks, Elliot. Really.	Look, J.D...I know why you're lying about everything. You don't think you're good enough for Kylie. I mean, you've always had this insecure thing even though you're this funny, weird, amazing guy. I mean...that's why I fell in love with you, and I'm betting if you just act like yourself, Kylie will too.
Carla, when you first started dating Turk, didn't you tell him you loved watching NBA basketball every weekend?	Oh, the Miracle Lift Super Push-Up bra?
And how many games have you watched since he proposed?	Yeah.
Exactly.	Ah...heh.
Dr. Kelso made me realize that lies come back to haunt you even little ones about cake.Heck, even a lie of omission shook the foundation of a couple that was much more established than Kylie and me.And I knew I couldn't let her go out that door.	Double or nothin'!We're even. Good night, sir.
Kylie, wait.	Let's go.
I had sex with her. A lot.	Adios, assface.
If I don't come clean now, whether it's a few weeks or months or years from now, I know it's gonna come back to haunt me and ruin us, and I don't want that.	Why are you telling me this?
Yeah.... I understand. It's....	I'm not looking for a project.
Wait. You know, if we if we leave like that, that's how we're always gonna remember this night. I don't want that.	So get it together.
Okay, okay, we passed Section One "Sitcoms about or involving Asian-American diner owners." Now on to Section Two "Fat, tubby T.V. husbands and the crazy-hot women that would never actually be married to them."	You marry her. You marry her now! You marry her!
Turk was freaked out because Carla never joins us on 'Sanford and Son' night. Or 'Cheers' night. I think it was because she was feeling a little romantically competitive with Kylie and me.	Yes!
...unfortunately, Turk wasn't on the same wavelength.	Uh! Darn it! You won!
YES! Ten to nine!	AHHH! DO YOU SEE WHAT YOU GET, CARLA!? DO YOU SEE WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU MESS WITH THE WARRIOR!?!
Hi.	Hi.
Bye.Ahh. Kylie's in class all day and she bartends at night, and I'm still working sixteen-hour shifts, so we try to make sure we kiss at least once a day. Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, she takes a cab over here; Tuesdays and Thursdays, I scooter to my baby!	Bye.
Of course, there's always one positive when something like this happens.	Oh, it's not so bad. It's only a few people here.OKAY, OKAY! EVERYBODY JUST SHUT UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP!Ahem. Thank you. Now, who's first?
WOOOOOOOOOO! WOOOOOOOOOHOOHOOHOOOO! I LOVE MEDICINE!	Of course, there's always one positive when something like this happens.
What the hell are we supposed to do?	Sure.
I sure hope I don't have dog flu.Well, Mr. Bernstein, do you have vomiting and diarrhea?	Loretta, relax, I've been involved in every ridiculous T.V.-induced panic there is. Poison pills, SARS, West Nile, North Face, South Fork, East River, monkeypox, pop rocks, toilet snakes, mad cow, bird flu, swine flu, and, quite frankly, every other flu that you could really only catch if you're actually fornicating with the animal it's named for.
Okay, then, Mr. James, you're free Wait a second, Charles James? I was watching the 'Cheers' DVD the other night are you Charles James the writer?	No.
Just. Stay. Calm.	Yeah, that's me.
Uh, Elliot, I need to take this gentleman upstairs for some more, uh, tests.	Just. Stay. Calm.
This is very important! He may even need a surgical consult.	J.D., don't leave me here.
Just like it.	Yeah! Like Carla from the show.
Really?	Wow.... I've never actually met anyone who had the same name as a character on the show.
Oh, well, that's understandable	No.
I mean, there's a lot of Sams....	Yeah.
Talk about your Dianes!	Excuse me, J.D.! Ahem. I just spent the last three hours interviewing two hundred and twelve hypochondriacs half of whom don't speak any English! Do you have any idea how embarrassing it is to mime "diarrhea"!?
What do you want me to do?	The man had a massive heart attack! I was nothing but professional!Okay, he's stable! Take the picture, Carla!
Mr. James, how long have you had that cough?	I want you to go in there and tell Mr. James that there's absolutely no reason for him to be up here.
Am I wrong, Elliot, or is that the kind of cough that needs a chest x-ray?	Oh, a couple of months now.
Thank you.	Probably.
Uh, Mr. James, I'm not quite sure how to say this, but...you have lung cancer...	Why'd they move me up here?
It was strange telling Mr. James he may only have a few weeks to live when just a few short hours ago we all thought he was fine....or realizing your relationship may not be as stable as you thought...	Uh, Mr. James, I'm not quite sure how to say this, but...you have lung cancer...
...or having to do someone else's dirty work for them...	We couldn't even make it one day.
...there are moments when we all wish life was more like a sitcom.	Say, Kenny? Can I talk to you for a second?
I'm sorry, too, sir.	I'm so sorry.
J.D.'s sitcom fantasy will be back after these messages!	Well, the good news is I won't have to eat my wife's cooking anymore, right!
Elliot, a word!A hot-air balloon seems kind of dangerous, I mean, he could get hurt.	We can do all that! We are gonna give you the best day ever!
Safety is always important, Elliot.	What's he gonna do? Bruise one of his giant malignant tumors?
It's floating wicker propelled by fire!Besides, I defy you to find one other thing that I'm afraid of!	Oh, my God. You're afraid of balloon rides, aren't you!
Is that my new sweater?!	Mopping time! Mopping time! It's mopping time!Yes, it's mopping time, my friend! And as you know, I always like to start in the exact spot you're standing. Let's get to work.Here we go.
It went dynamite with my beige cords!	No, this is my new sweater mop.
Does that degree come with headgear and allergies?	I can do Shakespeare in German!In college I double majored in theatre and classic languages.
You know what, save your breath! I'm about to get in a hot-air balloon and get Evil Knievel on my own ass!Come on, Elliot! Let's go French kiss the sun!	Carla, that makes you my girl. Hell, we could crank up the humidity and watch your hair explode, that'd be terrific.Which leaves me, and, unless all of you wanna see me turn a two-syllable word into a six-syllable word, I re-he-he-he-he-heally think that we should keep looking.
That was awesome!	Well, they only had time to paint one more face, so I let the kid behind me go, make him stop crying.
That sucks for you!I'm just kidding! We're gonna do it right here!	Talent show? I'd love to see it, but I'm too tired to get out of bed.
And if any of you cows, goats, or ducks have any questions, don't be afraid to ask me! I'm just like all of you, only giant and human!Thank you. I hope you enjoyed our production of World's Most Giant Doctor Goes to the Farm.	Hey, I'm wondering, what's the story with steel wool? I mean, is it steel or is it wool?Make up your mind, steel wool. Are there iron sheep hopping around in Scotland?Oh, brother. Look, I, uh...either start laughing or I start unplugging your machines.
Well, I hope you had a good day, Mr. James!	And by "good time" she means bumping uglies!
And who cares about him! He's anti-Semitic!	Wait a second! This chart isn't for Charles James, it's for James Charles! He's the one who has cancer, not you!
Hey everybody!Thanks for coming so quickly.You know, this is the kind of thing I normally say out loud in my head, but since we're all here...It just seems like, in the end, everything always works out. Because as long as we	Well, that's a load off my mind!
Wait, this isn't right.	Mr. James? Mr. James, can you hear me?
Unfortunately, around here things don't always end as neat and tidy as they do in sitcoms.Relationships aren't always magically fixed in thirty minutes you have to work on them.Problems don't always have easy solutions.	We're gonna intubate!dopamine! Wide open! I need an ET tube. Where's anesthesia?
And around here, nice people don't always get better.And at times like that, it's comforting to know there's always one thing that can pick your spirits up.	Welcome to my world. Now, imagine going home to my wife.
No, no. Come on, I still have a little saliva left.	Too much kissing?
As I felt the onslaught of what can only be described as a vicious tongue cramp, I decided it was time to let Kylie see my favorite dance. The "For God's sake, invite me to stay over" dance.	No, no. Come on, I still have a little saliva left.
The dance begins with a subtle hint.	As I felt the onslaught of what can only be described as a vicious tongue cramp, I decided it was time to let Kylie see my favorite dance. The "For God's sake, invite me to stay over" dance.
I am so pooped.	The dance begins with a subtle hint.
Step Two: Sashay her into sympathy.	I am so pooped.
It's chilly out there.	Step Two: Sashay her into sympathy.
Finally, sweep her off her feet with your vulnerable cuteness.	It is cold.
You know what I call this weather? Snuggle weather.	Finally, sweep her off her feet with your vulnerable cuteness.
Tip the band leader and fluff up the pillows, because this dance is done.	You know what I call this weather? Snuggle weather.
I wasn't the only one having relationship trouble.	Yeah, hit the bricks, bitch. You got no game! Ha ha ha ha ha!
What? Is this about the bra catapult thing? Because if it's that big a deal, I can throw my own water balloons. I don't need those C-cups.	You have to move out.
What? When have I ever been all up in your space?	You're all up in our space!
Whooooo! Sorry about the twosie, guys.Huh. And here I thought that was a lovely evening.	Mm-hmm.
Oh.	Nope. I lived with the Babcocks for two years.
All right, Carla calls the shots. Appeal to her rational side.	Oh.
Carla, I totally understand you guys need your space, but with work and my financial situation, finding a new place is gonna be, minimum, two to four years.	All right, Carla calls the shots. Appeal to her rational side.
She called me a man!	Come on, Bambi. Aren't there any other married couples that want to live in a small apartment with a 29-year-old man?
Turk, I've always had your back and you always had mine. Are you sure you want to go through with this?	She called me a man!
I banged your first girlfriend.	It was my idea.
Now, look, I need a favor. Let me try it. I'll move out for a week; if you still like it, I'll move out for good.All right. And d-d-d-don't worry about John Dorian, because I may be poor in pocket, but I'm rich in friends!	Chantal?
That's okay, because when God closes a window, he opens a door.	Nope.
Kylie, I hear you. But trust me, this week is not gonna be about sex. Even though I think we both agree that's where we'd eventually like our relationship to end up, right?	I'm just not sure I'm comfortable with you sleeping here.
Okay....	The Todd's not accustomed to receiving gentleman callers.
Oh, I don't I don't have one of those, Todd.	Oh, I don't swim.
Extra-medium.	No problem.
They say just admitting there's a problem is half the battle......even if it's something you didn't expect...	What are you trying to say?
The bottom line is, when the warning signs are right in front of you, there's no denying the truth.	We miss J.D.
Tell them you want to come back!	J.D., we're right here!
I just came by to get my toothbrush.	Tell them you want to come back!
Finger. Bingo.	Carla took your toothbrush out the bathroom and put it in the hall closet.
Hey, guys! The heater's broken again.	Baby, no. We're too proud. We are the proud Turks.
I clubbed it with a Mag-Lite.	What happened?
I could probably stay and fix it. It could take three, four, five days.	I clubbed it with a Mag-Lite.
Suit yourself.	I did a triple bypass yesterday. I think I could fix the heater.
I don't think so, buddy.	So I hear you're homeless. I wanna volunteer, give you a place to stay.
You're gonna slather jam on my face and sic a family of raccoons on me, aren't you!	Listen, crash in my garage. I guarantee you there will not be another person in there.
I'm out.	Damn it. I've become predictable.
Options?! I got cable TV and a dead dog! I got plenty of options!	Oh, yeah? Well, from what I hear I'm your last option.
Lonnie, you have three kids?	Sorry, bro. We're a little crowded tonight.
Does Doug Murphy live here?	Yeah?
Yeah.	The pathologist?
Okay.... But, Mr. McMahon, would you mind	No. He moved out.
You are correct, sir!	Hi-ohhhhhhhhhhh!
Who needs a baby-sitter? I'll do it! You don't even have to pay me in cash, just pay me in hot showers. And you don't have to, like, wash me unless you want to, but that could be weird. I don't know.	Oh, bring it on, daddy.
Come on, you two are interracial best buddies. I, too, have a black best friend. Go out, enjoy it! Celebrate your uniqueness! I can do it!	Newbie, I've got this one covered.
Well, Turk lets me call him Brown Bear.	I'm sorry. Did you just call me black? Because the last time I checked, the correct term was "African-American."
I should go.	Who the hell is Turk?!
Sometimes the worst thing is getting exactly what you want.	You got it.
Thanks, Kylie. I can just sleep on the couch.	Well, it means a lot to me that you would go through all that just to respect my boundaries.
I couldn't have planned it better.	You don't have to crash on the couch.Well, Dr. Dorian, are you gonna join me?
I don't want to come home. It took me a month to get here from the couch.	J.D.!
Get the moment back! Say something hot!	Uh, J.D., maybe you should go home.
Perhaps we could invite Turk and Carla to join us on the bed?I'll go.	Get the moment back! Say something hot!
At first I was a little disappointed that I wasn't sleeping at Kylie's, but it was good to be home.	That's just not gonna happen. No way.
I'm home!You guys moved couch?	At first I was a little disappointed that I wasn't sleeping at Kylie's, but it was good to be home.
It's always nice to let your friends know that you appreciate them.	I'm home!You guys moved couch?
I missed you, my African-American friend.	I'm glad you're home, buddy.
Brown Bear.	Call me Brown Bear.
But sometimes you just can't quite find words to show that appreciation.	This, uh...is a classmate of mine from medical school. He's located up in your area now. I think he'd really be able to help you.
Aha! Behold, the Twinkie from the first day we moved in! I owe you an apology, Turk.	You know what? I probably would, too.
What do you mean?	So, Bambi, what's the deal with all the things you do around here?
At the end of the day, the best thing to do for your friends is to be honest.	The laundry, the fixing the radiator, the listening to me gossip and playing stupid games with Turk. How do you make yourself do all that stuff?
I don't know, I never really thought about it. I guess when you care about someone, you'll do whatever you can to make 'em happy.	At the end of the day, the best thing to do for your friends is to be honest.
You just have to hope that your honesty doesn't make them realize something they didn't wanna know.	I don't know, I never really thought about it. I guess when you care about someone, you'll do whatever you can to make 'em happy.
*God, I hope it's sex. Or a pony. I'll bet it's sex because I don't	I have a surprise for you tonight.
Nothing. I was just going to do a little laundry. I assume your	Wait right here. It's for your scooter What are you doing?
It's not! Look. Kylie. I'm just really proud of my abs. Or... ab.*Turk and Carla were having some relationship trouble of their own.	Why is it always about sex with you?
*Hell no.* Hell yes! Now if you'll excuse me, it's time for my nightly	Hey hey! There he is! My buddy hit it and quit it, didn't he?
Dude it was so naughty. We're kissing, right, and she's like "I think	Alright. Give me all the details on Kylie.
*Thank God Turk left because I can't think about sex anymore. Luckily	Damn you, ruptured spleen! To be continued!
Yes please.	Howdy, stranger. Do you still want me?
*So Molly's back in town. She definitely wants me.*	Hey stranger. Ouch!
That's J.D.	Bye. How you doing, J.J.?
Good Times?	Oh, right. I was just thinking of that Jimmy Walker sitcom.
*Even though she did the fake forget-my-name thing, she's here for me.	It's okay. I'm just here to see a patient.
Molly, I'm sure he's not that possessive.	Apparently he's gotten really possessive of me. He won't talk to the
Get him off! Get him off!	Get away from my doctor!
Would you give him a break? He's talking to his wife.	I'm on a break here, Newbie. Just tell your shiny headed roommate
Who are you talking to?	This just got interesting.
Your college girlfriend?	Rosanna.
Can I say hi?	Yeah.
Hey Rosanna.	Yeah.
This phone is indestructible! If it has a camera, I'm so getting one.	Hello? Hello? J.D.?
Why are you talking to your college girlfriend?	Dude!!!
Give me a pound, dawg.	He gets me.
God, I'd love to get with Molly.	No, she loved him. They're in Aruba.
What are you implying?	Dude, you're pretty horny for a guy who claims to be getting it on a
Who?	Let's just say a little birdie told me that you and Kylie haven't
I trusted you!	Well, you haven't.
Oh really Turk? Has it been a month? Because time just flies when	Dude, it's been a month.
She did go to a movie with her brother-in-law.	Look. Kylie hasn't slept with you so what she's saying is that she
That is the dumbest idea I've ever heard.	That's perfect. Dude, you can have your cake and eat it too. It's like
Four stories and not a scratch. What are you made of?	Turk. I found your cell phone in the parking lot.
Hey, Kylie. I was calling to see how your day was going.	So this trip to India sounds so exotic.
Naked sweat drips...	...this ninety degree cave and sweat would just be dripping off our
Um, nothing, Kylie. It's a new band called the Naked Sweat Drips. They	What?
Feet up behind her head.	Oh, frick on a stick. I gotta go. I want to hear the rest of the
A patient, Kylie. Horrible car accident. You gotta wear your seatbelt,	Who has their feet behind their head?
*They say the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry.*	Hey. I'm getting out of here. Do you want to grab a beer?
*Still, sometimes, plans go exactly like they're supposed to.*	Dammit!
*And the success of those plans can take even the most hardened men by	Yeah, look. I made a bet with Dr. Cox that you would go out with
*And sometimes, even the best of men can go awry.*	No. Leave it.
Actually, Kylie. I... I can't tonight.*If having my cake and eating it too meant being with Molly, then	Buddy, you should try that cake I was telling you about!
Yeah! You should come with us!	Hey guys, you going out?
Oh no, it's the 'Close' button. When somebody gets close it activates	That's the 'Close' button.
*Oh no! She's got a pinky hold! Elliot's got the pinky strength of a	Fancy.
We haven't decided yet!	You're pressing the
*Some guy... I never get credit for anything!*	They don't work for me. I still can't sit down without showing the
*I knew how to get rid of both of them, but I can't do that to Turk.*	Phone calls from an ex would drive me nuts!
*Mr. Peeps? Why are you British?*	If you don't do it, I will.
Carla, go talk to Turk. Share with him your feelings. That's what he	I'll explain later. Just lose the extra bitches.
Oh, no no no. I just ordered two drinks.	We should probably go too. It's getting late.
*Okay J.D., you're a little drunk. And you know what happens when you	Oh, I'm sure he'll be here soon. I kissed a dude once. It was at furnace camp.
*I said control yourself!* You know	It's tough making new friends in Milwaukee.
I do. *I knew at that moment what would happen if I reached over and	You think so?
Oh, Kylie. I'm sorry. I hope it's okay that I stopped by. What was that for?	Thanks. Elliot.
Wait, are you saying that you're ready? Awesome.	I was thinking about how patient you've been with me. How right
And Kylie, you're right. It is fate. Because I was out with this girl	First, let me set the mood.
Well, she's not a random girl. I mean, I had a crush on her long	You blew me off tonight to be with some random girl?
*I was in trouble. And if I didn't play my cards right, I knew what*See, that's the thing about trying to have your cake and eating it	You should go.
*And really, who wants to risk something important, just for a silly	I lose my van to him, and I lose Margo to gangsta rap. Bad day.
How are you holding up?	Shut it, Newbie. Your blacker half is trying to concentrate.
Well now you make me all nervous.	I'm a little nervous.
*We all held our breath together.*	Okay, I'm done.
The Todd forgot to breathe again. Starting CPR.	The surgeon lives!
That is the most ridiculous hat I've ever seen. *And I must have it.*	Hey dude, check out what I found when I was taking out the trash!
*Turk and Carla were having relationship troubles so she'd been staying at Elliot's for a few days.* You were late the last time.	I've got time.
Yeah, but last week I set it back three hours so we could see what it felt like to live in Honolulu.	Yeah, but I set the clock ahead an hour last night so I wouldn't be late.
But then I set it back forty-three minutes to 8:08, turned the clock upside-down to see if it looked like the word Bob, which incidentally, it totally does	Yeah, but then I set the clock ahead five hours so I wouldn't feel like a skeeve for watching porn in the middle of the day.
Which means that it's actually...	That's true.
You got it, player! Hold on buddy!	Oh my God, dude, I've got to be downtown in like eight minutes!Dude, we're never going to make it in time! Take the shortcut through that hedge!
Oh really, Turk, was it a thick bush? Because there's berries in my ass! Just go!	That was a thick bush!
Don't worry, Turk, I got 'em!	Sorry. My bad, dude, my bad.
I wish I knew how it was going. Sorry about your hogs, fellas. Enjoy the free espressos. Warlord, I told you to sip it. Use your words.	My head hurts.
Yeah he did, because he wasn't listening. Napkin on your lap, Satan's Valet. Thank you.	Warlord... burn mouth.
Just tell her she can trust you.	Dude, she's got this whole trust issue with me.
My head hurts.	I did. But apparently if I'm the one she didn't know she could trust, how's she supposed to trust she can trust me telling her she can trust me?
No way, dude. It's never smart to get in the middle of someone else's relationship.	Yeah, mine did too. That's why I need you to go in.
Hey! Wanna grab a beer?	I'll let you wear my top hat.
No, but I can tell you who doesn't sing it. Billy Joel, who brought us such hits as "Uptown Girl" and "Matter of Trust". And speaking of trust, do you know who's really trustworthy? Turk. I call him Turkey Turkey Turkey Turkey Trust Trust. A little nickname.	Oh, it's so nice to get out. Oh, hey do you know who sings this song?
But I told Turk I'd talk about him constantly until you made me leave.	J.D., I know what you're trying to do and it's very sweet, but the last couple of days have been so messed up and confusing, I'd love to just try and forget about it and have a few drinks, okay?
Two appletinis, guv'ner!	I'll let you put the hat back on.
Because you can see Elliot's whole apartment from up here.	J.D., why are we sitting up here?
Carla, I'm not as think as you drunk I am. I mean...	J.D., you're drunk!
I can let go of the couch, if I so choose.	Then why can't you let go of the couch?
*There are many things we can't control, no matter how strong we might be. Like a kneejerk reaction.*	Okay, let go of the couch. Let go! You see?
*Or a Janitor who has it in for you.*	It's okay.
You're welcome. *And sometimes, you let go of the control you do have in a brief moment of weakness.* Sorry. Drunken accident.	Thank you, for helping me have some fun tonight.
Right.	Nothing happened.
Good night.	Good night.
Good night.	Good night.
Buenas... those things.	Buenas noches.
*Like she said, everything's fine.**There's nothing like the rays of the morning sun kissing you awake and gently reminding you that you got drunk and kissed your best friend's wife.* Oh my God!	Good night.
Yeah, but it was nothing!	Oh my God. So it really happened?
No! There wasn't even any tongue!	Nothing!
It was just a friend kiss!	No tongue!
No, I pursed them like this.	Were your lips parted at all?
Yes it is! It's a friend kiss and we will never talk about this to anyone ever!	I don't know, J.D. I remember my one lip being on top of your upper lip and my other lip being somewhere in the middle of yours, which means your lips were apart and I don't think that's a friend kiss.
Nothing.	What's going on?
Carla!	J.D. and I kissed.
Yes!	You kissed? Like a friend kiss?
Carla! You're killing me!	No!
Don't worry, ladies. I've closed the window.	No! Stop her!
I had to hide from Turk, so I went to the one place that I knew no one would ever venture. Ted? Ted?	Hello? Did someone come in?
Ted, what are you doing?	A little help!
Ted, lunch was four hours ago.	I like to do stomach crunches after lunch.
It's Wednesday.	Yep, I wasted most of my Tuesday.
Whoa! What's with the fifth degree?	There you are. Hey Ted. So how'd it go last night?
No, because this is two degrees worse. I can't breathe, it's like you're all over me. I'm trapped in a death coffin.	Don't you mean third degree?
*Alright, he knows your lying face, but silence is incriminating too. So think. What's between silence and talking?*	Calm down, I just want to see if you got anywhere with Carla.
Ted, you should probably sit down. You're looking a little purple.	I owe you one.
Thanks for saving my ass.	I know my own body.
I guess I'm glad we kissed then.	Well, I wasn't saving your ass. I didn't realize how easy it is to make little mistakes. They're stupid little mistakes that seem like nothing but can snowball on you and take your whole marriage with it, you know? I feel like I really understand now how Turk could have let stuff like that happen, you know? So I forgave him.
This is nice. The three of us sitting together again like the Three Musketeers.	No. Ahem. No.
*Carla was right. If a relationship is going to work, it has to be based on trust. Like a wife trusting her husband again.*	She's back! My baby's back!
*Even if it involves a compromise.*	You bet your sweet ass she did.
*Or a patient trusting his doctor to help him hold on to his dignity.*	Hey Jack! Just blink when you want me to get you down. Just give me the old blink-a-rooney. Terrific athlete. I'm thinking 2016 Olympics. Oh God, was that a blink? Excuse me.
*It may take a lot of work, but it's worth it.*Wow, that was a moist kiss. Wish I was wearing an apron.	Yeah! And then I pulled off Grandma's breathing apparatus. No, I'm serious!
*Because in the end, things work out for the best.*	Baby, from here on out I hide nothing from you. It's a clean start for us. Sports time!
*Or not.*	J.D. and I kissed.
It was barely more than a friend kiss, so we decided not to tell Turk... or so I thought.	Sorry, drunken accident.
Was it a comfortable silence? No. And I'm going to be the one who breaks it. Unfortunately I have one of Rowdy's hairs in my mouth... uh-oh!I guess there's a lot of things that can knock you on your ass...	J.D. & I kissed.
Like, for instance, when your 17-year-old neighbour doesn't see you as a smoking hottie anymore...	Was it a comfortable silence? No. And I'm going to be the one who breaks it. Unfortunately I have one of Rowdy's hairs in my mouth... uh-oh!I guess there's a lot of things that can knock you on your ass...
And of course, the one thing you can always count on to knock you on your ass...	Ma'am??? You just ma'amed your way out of me ever buying you beer again!Ma'am?
Floor Wax.	AARRGGHH!
When we got to work, not a whole lot had changed. The silence was killing me...	Reeeaaaly? Show me happy...Sad...Silly...Amused, bemused, c-mused...Show me angry.AARRGGHH!!Got angry down.
I miss the silence.	You kissed my wife.
Well that's kind of a trick question, Turk. I mean if I say yes, it's like I'm saying "damn dude, your wife is hot & I'd like to get me some of that". But if I say no then I'm all like "yo, I know she's your wife but you can keep that fish-lipped bitty".	Did you like it?
I can't use lip-balm; I always end up eating it. When I was little I used to spread it on crackers.	NO! His lips are chappy.
It was barely even a kiss dude; it was like an accidental lip bump, like oops.	Turk, look, I'm so sorry but you have to believe me. It was barely anything.
Sitting .	WHOOAAA! Don't even look at her. Sit on the floor.
Hey we're kind of in the middle of something here!	Now you don't have to put it on today, but...
Who gets a tattoo of a mop? Can I get up, my butt is asleep.	This'll just take a second.Nice, huh?
Me too buddy.	Turk, you know how I was so upset because you started calling your ex-girlfriend? I just couldn't understand how a married person could slip up like that, now I do. I'm so sorry.
Just watch buddy.	Guys, it's cool, don't even worry about it.
Whatever. You got something here though.	He didn't stop. Stop! This hallway is closed; you have to find another way around.
Well I don't know, you just look so cute in your little blue outfit; I wanted to give you a tickle.	What's that?
It's nice when things get back to normal.	Atta girl.Barbie! Feel free to kiss my ring.
Hey.	Hey guys.
Carla, you gotta try these sweet potato fries, they're amazing!	Hey.
You got it.	Put some ketchup on it.
Or finding out that you have no idea how to deal with a teenage girl...	Good lord!
The important thing is to not make a scene in the cafeteria.	Nice work.
Want another one?AARRGGHH!	The important thing is to not make a scene in the cafeteria.
My fries!	Turk, you said you were OK!
No Turk, it's understandable.	No.
Don't worry, this'll all be fine. You know Turk, I mean, whomever he blames will get the silent treatment for a couple of days, then he'll make snarky comments for a few months and then, sooner or later, he'll be laughing about the whole thing. It's just like the time I slept with his family's cleaning lady.	I'm sorry. The only way I'm gonna have closure here is if I can blame one of you guys. I just gotta figure out who.
I was staying in their guest-room & she was buffing the nightstand and she just kept on buffing. But hey, thanks for taking the hit on this one.	You slept with Tuni?
Oh but all you have to do is have sex with him & he'll forgive you. If I have sex with him he'll probably end up madder.	Me? Na-a na-a, you're his best friend, all you have to do is say "I'm sorry", high-five him & go "DAAAAHHHHH!"
Agreed.Dude she was pouring drinks into me & she knows I put out when I'm drunk.	You know what; let's not play into his blame game.
DAAAAHHHHH!	He took me to a bar.
I'm telling you dude, she was all over me. Like ants on candy.	I didn't ask him to walk me home.
And just like that it was time for the moment of truth...	Jordan, this award came from my interns. So the least you can do is show up & support me.
Hey Turk!	And just like that it was time for the moment of truth...
Be gracious.	The silent treatment.
I got 3 words for you; sucks to be, adding a fourth, you .	Be gracious.
After sharing a quick victory dance with Roland, the heavy-set orderly who, coincidentally, was my victory dance coach...	I got 3 words for you; sucks to be, adding a fourth, you .
OK, there it is. Thanks Roland, one day I'll get it.	Pop the hips, pop the hips J.D.
I got to thinking about relationships, about how people fall in love...Have kids...Grow old together...And say goodbye...And then for some reason I thought about the circus... but then I was back on relationships...	I doubt it.
Back to your room Mr. Johnson, you've got one ventricle!	I got to thinking about relationships, about how people fall in love...Have kids...Grow old together...And say goodbye...And then for some reason I thought about the circus... but then I was back on relationships...
And I couldn't help thinking that maybe it wasn't luck that made relationships last. Maybe it was just a matter of who takes fewer hits...	Back to your room Mr. Johnson, you've got one ventricle!
And I realized I should have been the one to take that hit, not Carla.	You don't have to talk to me, just wave if you're gonna give me a ride home.
That was all it was! And if you still need someone to blame, why don't you try blaming yourself?	What are you doing?!
Dude, who do you think you're talking to, you think you've been the World's greatest husband? Please, I was there when you were flirting with your ex-girlfriend & neglected to tell her you were married. I was there when you tried to hook up with that waitress, the day before you got engaged. And I was definitely there when you hooked up with that nasty ass stripper at "Boobies, Boobies, Boobies".	Aw man, I'm going home.
I know but I told her my name was Turk. Look the point is, think of the millions of times you chose to not to hang out with your wife, 'cause you were trying to hang out with me. You know, maybe it's time you started acting like a real husband, instead of acting like some sort of crazy... cowboy.	That wasn't me that was you!
I don't know, it just came to me.You know I'm right Turk.	A cowboy?
When your pride's at stake, you can't help but have questions...	I don't know, it just came to me.You know I'm right Turk.
A lot of times, the answer is about sacrifice...	How is it that no man understands that every woman, whether she's 16 or 60, still has that awkward, insecure, self-conscious teenage girl inside of her?
Sometimes sacrifice is only wearing your new uni when you're not at work...	Hey!Look here, I was thinking maybe, maybe you'd rather just stay in tonight. You know have some pizza watch, watch some movies, what do you say?Are you trying to smile?You're so damned cute.
Other times, it's about swallowing that damn pride...	OK how about this one? Three blue-jays fly into a bar & they say, "we just want to wet out beaks". Ha, ha, ha... no? Sorry Dan, you tell one.
But ultimately, big or small, sacrifice is about doing something you don't really wanna do.	J.D., would you hand me the wine please? Turk's not talking to me.
Hey guys, I know we talked about this before but, I'm moving out.	But ultimately, big or small, sacrifice is about doing something you don't really wanna do.
Man, you guys need your space.	Really?
You're gonna miss me though.	Wow, thanks man.
Classic Hooch! Listen, even though I'm not gonna be paid, I'm gonna cover your shift at the clinic tonight so you can do Mr. Schindler's endoscopy.	That's my name....don't wear it out.
Were you doing Hooch?	Who's doing the endoscopy on Mr. Schindler?
Oh, Hooch!	Everyone hates you guys.
As much as Hooch loved us, it was even better to see Turk happy. See, he and Carla had recently started couples therapy, and I'm not sure he was enjoying it.	Hooch is crazy!
I decided to help their marriage by moving out. Partly because Carla and I had accidentally kissed and messed things up, but mostly because it was time. Still, finding an apartment has not been easy.	No, not really.
I'm so sorry about your father. I'm sure he lived a wonderful life at... 14 Maple Drive, Apartment 4B. Was he lucky enough to enjoy a washer and dryer in his unit while he was alive?Ever mention any hot neighbors?What are you doing in the on-call room?	I decided to help their marriage by moving out. Partly because Carla and I had accidentally kissed and messed things up, but mostly because it was time. Still, finding an apartment has not been easy.
Thankfully, Turk had gotten over the whole kissing incident. Still, there's a weird new thing he does whenever he says goodbye.	Okay.
Agh! ...Peace, homey!	Okay, I'll see you around.
I'm Dr. Dorian. Uh, I'm the one that's taken care of you the last nineteen times you've been in here. She's getting a little forgetful you know how that happens. Are you a relative?	Who are you?
That's a lovely memory, Betty. You know what else is a lovely memory that Sunday I spent eight hours helping you join the Wilford Brimley fan club. You don't remember that, do ya.	It was raining, and you were wearing a blue sweater!
So Elliot, the first thing we're gonna need to do is....	So, uh, Betty, I'll check on you the second I get back, okay? You get better, now!
Oh, don't worry about her, Betty, you're in good hands with Dr. Dorian.	Is Dr. Reid coming back?
That's me! Betty, Dr. Dorian. 'Cocoon'. Wilford Brimley. Steve Guttenberg. The whole day. No?	Who's that?
Even though I had created a super medical crime-fighting team, I felt lousy. See, I had just told Betty that her lungs had finally given out and she wasn't gonna leave the hospital this time.	Dammit, Turner! It just doesn't make sense!
Well, we could put you on a breathing machine, but it's unlikely you'd ever come off of it. Or I could just make sure you're as comfortable as possible.	So...what are my choices?
"As comfortable as possible." I've said that a million times and I still have no idea what it means.	Well, we could put you on a breathing machine, but it's unlikely you'd ever come off of it. Or I could just make sure you're as comfortable as possible.
There you go, Betty! That's every cotton ball in the hospital!	"As comfortable as possible." I've said that a million times and I still have no idea what it means.
Then you're ready to die.Look, Betty, is there anyone you'd like to talk this over with?She just wants to talk to you for a minute.	Ohhh! I am very, very comfortable!
Just about how and when she should die.	Yeah? About what?
Look, this woman is alone, she's depressed, and for some reason she feels like she's connected with you.	Oh, that's not a problem. I counsel most of my random neighbors on their deathbeds.
That's great! Keep it light! Open with a joke, and before you know it you and your raft will be on a four-hour trip to New Zealand!	Look, I'm sorry, but I wouldn't know what to say.
Oh no. You're dangerously close to revealing that geography is your Achilles heel. Say something smart to regain credibility.	No, it's more like fourteen hours.
Vasovagal syncope is mediated by the autonomic nervous system. And Betty needs you, pal. She does! Come on, do it. You'll feel good, trust me.	Oh no. You're dangerously close to revealing that geography is your Achilles heel. Say something smart to regain credibility.
You can dance your way there from Old Zealand.	Trust you? You don't even know where New Zealand is.
She's a dude.	So that girl's kinda cute, what's her story?
Gotta look at the Adam's apple, buddy.	Nuh-uh.
Sure.	J.D., you got a sec?
Well, I think that's true. I mean, if you look at the whole Carla kissing thing, I think intellectually you moved on, but emotionally you're still upset. You'll get there, though, pal.	So check this out: Our therapist says I'm the type of guy who pretends everything's okay even when I'm upset deep down inside.
Really? Oh, okay. I'll see you later. Bye.Ow! You see!	I'm not upset!
Let's try it again. I'll see you later, buddy. Bye!	See what?
OW! Always the same spot! It's like your fingers are stone!	Bye.
Yeah, you're like the brown Hulk.Hey. How's it going in here, you two?	I've been hitting you.
No way!	Oh, pretty good. Pretty good. We, uh, we talked about her past. Betty even let me in on a few of her romantic trysts from her younger days you familiar with Mr. David Brinkley?
Okay.	And when we finally got down to talking for real, well, it became pretty obvious that...Betty had already made a decision.
...He didn't hide because he was afraid to admit someone was right...	He thinks I'm cute. He thinks I'm cah-yute. He thinks I'm cute, he thinks I'm cute, he thinks I'm cute...
...He didn't run because he was scared of facing his own feelings...	No reason.
Of course, he wouldn't've been able to do it if it weren't for his secret weapon...	Fine.
Dr. John Dorian.	Of course, he wouldn't've been able to do it if it weren't for his secret weapon...
Wha?	What?
No I didn't, Jake.	You just said your name in a weird kinda summing-up way.
See, that's summing up in a weird way.	Ah, so you're Jake! Uh, as I understand it, you just talked my sister into ending her life. Long story short: I'm a lawyer, I'm suing you. Once again: Sister dying, brother lawyer, suing you!
"Brother lawyer." That's it.	Yeah.
Yes. Here's Ted, our brilliant hospital attorney. Sharp as a tack.	Is that him?
No, no, Ted, we're on his side.	Mark my words, Jake! We're gonna take every last cent you have!
Go take a nap, Ted.	I don't get real cards until I win a case.
"Buy Groceries. Kill Self."	He spelled "attorney" wrong.
I am not from the future, Jake!Yes! It finally worked! What are the odds?	Just admit it you're just here from the future to destroy me.
Who's Greg Barton?	I don't know what the odds are, J.D., but what I do know is I'm about to go down to my truck, get my kayak paddle, and go Greg Barton on your ass.
Oh, Greg Barton!	He's a famous kayaker.
I know.	I hate you, J.D.
I didn't do this, Kelso did!	I thought we were doing mustaches on Sunday?
Enough with the mustaches, dude! Are you responsible for breaking up Turner and Hooch?	You invited Kelso to Mustache Sunday?
Can you believe this guy?	Yeah. I'm gonna screw him to the wall.
Sir, you laughed and pointed when she fell.	Son, look around. There's an old man with Alzheimer's who no one bothers to come visit. This morning I had a chat with a woman who refuses to stop using cocaine even though she's six months pregnant. And just last week I saw an older woman fall and break her hip because some guy was too busy to hold the door open for her!
Kelso had a point. I mean, in the outside world you'll occasionally see a stream of cars drive by an old woman with a flat tire. But around here, every time you round a corner, well...	I didn't say it wasn't funny; I just said it happened. Come on, when's the last time you saw a glimpse of humanity in this place.
...Anyway, I knew what I had to do.	She fell again.
Just go, Jake! No one here knows your last name if anything happens, he'll never be able to find you. Go enjoy your little rafting thing in New Zealand which, incidentally, is ten thousand miles east of Australia, and famous for alcoholism and clam chowder. I've been brushing up on my New Zealand.	...Anyway, I knew what I had to do.
Oh. Well go, anyway, wherever it is you're rafting.	You've been brushing up on New England.
He just left!	Where's he going?
And then something surprising happened.	Come back here!Come on, fellas!
It's amazing how a selfless gesture can affect so many people.	They're smart, they are organized...and they've got my keys!
One man was pushed to make the right decision.	Yeah.
And another man realized it's okay to be a decent human being for once.	Just make her as comfortable as possible.
As for me, seeing Jake come back and do the right thing restored my faith in humanity.	Oh, congratulations, Clarissa!
And don't you forget who put that tire on and tightened those lugnuts, Martha! Okay, sweetie, have fun at the swap-meet! Drive safe.	I can't believe that six young men stopped to help an old lady change a tire!
Yep. It sure feels good to do the right thing.	And don't you forget who put that tire on and tightened those lugnuts, Martha! Okay, sweetie, have fun at the swap-meet! Drive safe.
Righty loosey, lefty tighty.	Yep. It sure feels good to do the right thing.
Oh, "righty tighty! lefty loosey!" Ohhhh, man. It still feels good.	Righty loosey, lefty tighty.
Jello-O is for winners.	Can I get some Jell-O, please?
I'm just kidding. We'll have some sent right to your room, big guy.	What?
Dude, you're not gonna believe how much trouble I'm having finding a place to live.	Thank you.
Perfect for what?Yeah, I think I'm gonna keep looking.	Ohh, he's perfect.
Things were going better for Elliot.	Perfect for what?Yeah, I think I'm gonna keep looking.
For some reason, Jake was able to handle the piping hot giant bowl of crazy that is Elliot Reid.	You're welcome for the movie.
Unfortunately for Jake, he still had to pass muster with Turk and me. And nothing is quite as daunting as our "good guy test."	Coolio! Let's go get some ice cream!
Well, I could use a beer.	Unfortunately for Jake, he still had to pass muster with Turk and me. And nothing is quite as daunting as our "good guy test."
Good guy.	I got this round. Be right back.
Yeah.	Great guy.
Excellent choice.	Oh, my God!
Put your hand down, Lonnie.	That's me, daddy.
In my defense, I was up late watching a 'Designing Women' marathon.	And then there was the resident who confirmed that misdiagnosis.
Oh, please, you're a half a glass of wine away from nuding up and doing your go-to move.	You are a weird and angry man!Look, I have just been thinking about all of my relationships, and every time one has potential, I go too fast and ruin everything. Long story short, Jake's not getting any.
Her on top, eyes closed, yelling, "Don't look at me! Don't look at me!"	Which is?
Calm down, boys. Let me just ask.Can you really swallow your whole fist?	No way! She can't do that! Nooo!
Shhh. Don't ruin it.	Ohhhhhhhhhhhh.
You know what, I really don't have time to be dealing with your little sex pickle.	Do you guys have any other ideas?
I hate that thing.	Ha!
There are certain people in life who know how to push your buttons.	So what did happen at the taco stand?
So it's important to have a plan to deal with it. Even if it means never being alone with someone.	Well, the guy started choking, so naturally I sprung into action and gave him an emergency trach.Yeah.
Mmm. Doesn't Kathleen Turner have dynamite nerps?	Wow, this 'Body Heats a sexy movie, huh?
Of course, if that person is stubborn, there's not much you can do.	Yeah.
The key is to figure out a way to not let them get the best of you.	My floors are my children! I'VE GIVEN THEM NAMES!
Well, maybe next time she'll yell "shotgun" a little faster!	Mm-mm. Maybe next time we'll let you sit up front.
This is so awkward. Look away. Look away!	Just came back to get my keys.
I never gave you any references!	All your references checked out.
Well, unfortunately for you, I happen to know that the guy you're dating is always under speed dial number one.	You can't make me!
Two is your current boyfriend!	Constipation hotline?
Guess I should get goin'....	Cool.
Page me when you're headed home!	Walk with me.
As I gangsta-leaned down the hallway in the rad new wheels I found by the dumpster, I couldn't help but think how ego affects everything.Without a healthy dose of it, you can't trust yourself to do what you really want.	I don't know how it happened again, but it did!
Of course, with too much ego you can end up losing something you wish you still had.	Oh, thank God!
But with the right amount, nothing can get in your way.	I'm not used to walking from my office to the nurses' station.
These are the last eight guys in the hospital who don't realize I suck at basketball.	Who are these guys?
Okay, so here's what's gonna happen: I finally mastered my running hook-shot, okay?	Ah.
So when we go to pick teams, I'm gonna hit that shot. Then you say, "I'll take that guy!" At which point, Carla is gonna page me . And I'll say, "Crap, I gotta go." And you go, "Damn! We just lost the best player out here!" Then there'll be eight guys in the hospital who think I'm good at sports, and word will spread.	Ah-huh?
Between these thoughts.	When do you find time to see your patients?
Elliot's boyfriend, Jake, had given her confidence to do things she'd never been able to do before.	Oh. Okay. Let's play some ball!I got that guy.
...Like talking to people when she's on the toilet.	You know it!
Why are we lying in the parking lot?	Yeah.
Oh, thanks SCB! By the way, I should tell you something: I found an apartment, I'm moving out the day after tomorrow.	Your hook-shot knocked you unconscious, so I lied down next to you so everyone would just think we were chillin'.
Yeah.	Wow.
"Super Chocolate Bear."	What does "SCB" mean?
I knew you would.	I love it.
Who made it?	Who wants a piece of pie!
As a doctor, you get good at piecing things together.	Let's say my mom.
This one was obvious.	Who wants a piece of pie!
No thank you.	This one was obvious.
Welcome to our lair! I'm an eighth-level ogre magi with invisibility. And this is Randall!You were a dork!I'm glad nothing else around here is changing.	Do you remember our first day together?Yo, they call me Chris One. What's the dilly-yo?
Uhh, Jake...is it?	So you took a fall-back job because you were afraid to go for it?
I know your name, Jake, I'm being condescending.	Yeah, it's
Oh, whoever Rowdy goes to first, he gets to keep him.	What are you doing?
Huzzah! He's mine!	If he stays, I'll drive him out to the country and leave him there.
Hooch is crazy!I'm really gonna miss this kinda stuff.	Who the hell...put bouillon cubes in the shower head!?! Huh? Hm, did you do it? Hm? Did you? If it happens again, I will wait in my S.U.V., blast me some speed-metal 5.1 surround sound, heavy on the bass and someone...will be getting...mowed...down.Deet-deet-deet!
Yeah, but we won't be able to stay up 'til six in the morning planning anything as genius as the soup shower! This is the end of an era, Super Choc.	Why? We'll still be able to pull pranks on him after you move out.
Guilty.	You know how you're prone to overly sensitive girly displays of sentimentality?
Oh! Can we cut words out of magazines that represent how we feel about each other and glue them into a "Friends Forever" collage?	Okay, now, if you reel it back a little bit, I'll get somebody to cover for me tonight, and I'll help you pack your stuff.
Oh. Well, can we drink beers and reminisce?	Hell no.
That's all I wanted to do anyway.	Hell yes!
Plus, I already made the collage.	That's all I wanted to do anyway.
No, I didn't know.	Now, listen to me. You gotta make tonight count. 'Cause you'll never be as cool as you were when you were rollin' with The Big Dog as your roommate, you know?
...Like excitement about a new job...	Hello?
...Or disappointment about a lost opportunity...	Hey!
As for me, I just didn't want Turk to know that he'd hurt my feelings.	Maybe next year.
I dunno, I figured it wasn't that big a deal. Anyway, I'm pretty tired from the move, so I'm probably just gonna crash....Sort of famished...	As for me, I just didn't want Turk to know that he'd hurt my feelings.
Turk didn't even realize he'd pissed me off, so explaining my feelings to him was the smart move. I took a slightly different tack.	Mm.
That seat's taken, ass-face!	Turk didn't even realize he'd pissed me off, so explaining my feelings to him was the smart move. I took a slightly different tack.
Hello there, Chocolate Bear Two.	By who?
I replaced your ass!	Hooch!? J.D., what the hell is going on here!?
Hooch is crazy.Oh, sorry, old habit.	If it happens again, I'm gonna take one of your fingers. That'll be my...funny prank.
I wasn't the only unhappy person in our hospital family.	Hooch is crazy.Oh, sorry, old habit.
Why don't you ask Todd? Due to what can only be described as epic diarrhea, he's been on an I.V. drip for thirty-six hours!	Come on, why not?
Maybe I was being unfair to Turk. Maybe it's too much to expect a friend to just sense that you're upset and wanna talk about it.	Make-it-stop five?
Okay, but Turk's a prideful guy, and it's hard for prideful guys to admit when they've been insensitive.	Carla, I can sense you're upset. Talk to me.
Touché, magic hallway.	Listen, Jordan, I've been incredibly insensitive.
Turk!	Touché, magic hallway.
Hooch is crazy....So, Hooch, this is it.	No, it's me Hooch, Vanilla Bear! Heh heh!
Then things took a turn.	Hooch is crazy....So, Hooch, this is it.
Wait, where's Rowdy?There he is!THERE HE IS!	Then things took a turn.
Yo, Hooch is seriously crazy.	Who else thinks they're faster than me, huh? Huh!?
Dude, I don't mean to sound girly, but, for the last twelve years, you've practically been like...my wife.	Why do I have to say I'm sorry?
Look, before, when you said I'd never be as cool as when I was living with you, you know there's some truth to that. I'm sorta like odd and geeky, and you've always sort of...validated me.	How is that girly?
Well, say things'll be the same.	J.D., you're just moving out.
Mmkay.	That's Carla and I gotta go.
Why are you so obsessed with this!?	No better pick-me-up than a slice of Mom's pie!
Really?	I dunno. I think it's 'cause this time, I wasn't trying to mess with you.
Who would do this to themselves?	Really.Huh?
As every piece of food I'd put into my body in the last year was rushing out of me, it got me thinking. The way some things never change shines a light on the things that do.Like when a new person comes into the hospital to stay...	Totally worth it.
...Or an old friend leaves for good.Sometimes the biggest changes are a result of an impulsive decision.	I can't believe I'm actually doing this. You're meeting me out later, right?
And so here I am a guy in an empty apartment with a dead dog. Oh, and that's not a tear on my cheek, that's just from the leak in my ceiling. And, yes, change is scary, but it's also inevitable. It's up to you to make the best of it. I mean, it's not like opportunity is just gonna fall in to your lap.	I know you're feeling abandoned right now, but we just went through a really rough spot, and I'm not the type of guy to make life-changing decisions without thinking about it for at least, like...a few months.Let's make a baby.
Then again....	Agh!
Howdy, neighbor, I'm Jonathan!	Then again....
I hate change.	You eyeballin' my woman?
And Turk and Carla are trying to make a baby.	Woooooo!
Yep, life was pretty different.	My bad, baby.
This didn't feel like my scooter.	Hey! You took my Porsche from the valet?
Ow! Look, no harm done. Here's your driving glasses, here's your driving scarf, and here are you driving gloves.Fine, here's your driving sock.	This didn't feel like my scooter.
I didn't care, because now that I'm and attending, I had picked out a whole new look.	Ow! Look, no harm done. Here's your driving glasses, here's your driving scarf, and here are you driving gloves.Fine, here's your driving sock.
Morning, colleague!	I didn't care, because now that I'm and attending, I had picked out a whole new look.
Ooh, what, tall, dark and scary? I can wear whatever the hell I What are you doing?	Oh, absolutely not.
I had a little trouble getting my Baby Gap t-shirt off.	...seven, eight, nine and ten.
Ow.Whoooaaaaahhhh! OK, you know, I'm gonna I'm gonna go with 'ow.'	It'll happen.
Born without lips.	How depressing is it being you? I mean seriously, would you equate it more with being a lifelong Cub fan or to, say, being born without lips?
How sad.	I know a guy. His house just burned down.
Listen, today, if you bother me, could you do it without being around me? Because I have new interns starting today. Can you imagine what it's like to see this place through their eyes for the first time?	Well, he was smoking in bed. He shouldn't have smoked. Because he looked ridiculous.I have a snake face.
Hey! You must be Keith. Don't look so nervous, buddy, I got your back.	Has anyone seen Johnny, the tackling Alzheimer's patient?
OK, good work, buddy. Stay in school.Mr. Kellerman, how're you feeling?	No problem.
Well, that's probably why you're here! Ha! Humor is a great ice-breaker for patients, OK? Follow me. Mr. Kellerman has congestive heart failure. OK, Lisa, I want you to start him on diuretics, OK? That way we'll loosen up some of the fluid around his lungs. The good news is, he'll go home tomorrow. Bad news is if he's not here he won't move up on the heart transplant list. See, in medicine there are lots of Catch 22's, a phrase made famous, I believe, by an old fisherman, who would stay out fishing until he caught how many fish? Anybody? That's right, 22. See, in 1492, Columbus	Oh, not great.
Oh, you guys can skedaddle.	Newbie! If you loved the sound of your very own voice any more, you'd probably just sit in a little room all day and sing to yourself.
I turned in my paperwork already, but I'm gonna wait till tomorrow to turn in my urine sample out of respect for the fellows in the lab. There's an asparagus issue.	Perry, your lips, my ass, they should meet. Dorian, after four years, I can only hope that you are no longer following in his footsteps.
Thanks, Dr. Kelso! You know he said half-sincere, but I think he was full-sincere. Feel my shoulder, it's still warm.	Now there's an answer that warrants a half-sincere pat on the shoulder.
Yes we are.	Lindsay, by you reaching the level of attending physician, you've somehow managed to become a member of club that *I* belong to. Obviously, there was no vote, because if there had been, you would still hear the sound of my voice screaming, "Nay! Nay! Oh, dear God, one thousand times nay!" That being said, it's my obligation to let you in on the organization's one and only bylaw: We're men.
I don't need your approval, or your stupid man cards! Although the lettering is darling, have you ever done calligraphy?	The women are men, the children are men, the men of course...*men.* So, I went ahead and took the liberty of making you five man cards.Hold them very dear because every time you drop the ball "manwise," I'm going to take one from you.
Damn it!	Thank you.
That night, since we were low on cash, Turk snuck me into the movies.	Damn it!
Afterwards, we talked about my living arrangements.	One, please.
Are you sure about this?	Afterwards, we talked about my living arrangements.
Carla was pretty psyched to get rid of me. Are you gonna tell her?	You shouldn't stay in a hotel, so why don't you just stay here until you find a place?
Turk, you left your gym shorts in here!	Mm, OK.
W-w-w-wait! Could you quickly scratch my nose? Ah. Ooh. Okay. Okay.Don't zip me up. NO! Turk! Turk! Whoa, Whooooaaa!	Look. I gotta sex her up. I'll be back as quick as I can. So I'll be 'bout an hour and half.
Maybe someone or something had to gnaw a hole in it to keep from suffocating.	Oh, babe, I borrowed your backpack this morning and all my change fell out the bottom.
Well maybe a hundred wasn't enough, I don't know!	And maybe someone already apologized for that about a hundred times.
Damn it!	Absolutely no lover's quarrels!
The Turks are sneaky.Not you guys, I think Omar took my pudding.	How did this conversation become about me?
Hey Keith! Can I get your pudding?	Mmmmm.
Interns.	Uh...Eh..
That's my pudding, Omar!Huh. This guy's unbelievable.OK, guys, for some reason Mr. Kellerman's fluid situation isn't getting any better. I think we should be more aggressive. Keith? Why don't you go get a Lasix drip.Other way, Keith!Uh, Jason, when you're filling out a female patient's exam report, her breasts can be healthy or unhealthy. Never "bangin' double-D's."	That'll end well. Dude!
I'm sorry, Mr. Larson, but I do not like the look of that leg.We would have better hours. All right, gang, get out of here. Hey, everybody? Great work today.	There's so much paperwork. My dad was a veterinarian and he never had to do any. Sometimes I wish this place were more like a horse hospital.
Being Turk's secret roommate was going great. Until now.	Perfect.
OK, you've been working on your Turk impression since college. Time to shine!	Turk? I'm leaving for work.
Baby I'll be thinking about your lovelies and whatnot until the second I see you. But right now, I'm doin' my business.	Turk?
I thought she was gone.	Dude! That's the best that's ever sounded!
Well, you better get ready. She's been off the pill for like a week.What have you done?	Nah, she came back for a quickie. All this baby stuff, man, I feel like she rushed me into it. To tell you the truth I'm not even sure I'm ready.
That screaming patient would have to wait. I had bigger problems.	Nice ass, grandma!
Hey, Keith! I just called upstairs to see how Mr. Kellerman was doing. And get this, the nurse told me you never even started him on a Lasix drip. And Lisa! Imagine my surprise when she told me you never even increased his diuretic in the first place! I'm forced to ask, are you people trained killers? Say something, Keith.	That screaming patient would have to wait. I had bigger problems.
They're messing up on purpose?	Dr. Dorian? If he gets bad enough that we have to put him on inotropes, he'll jump to the top of the transplant list and then he'll get a new heart.
Who told you guys to do this?	They're messing up on purpose?
There's a lot of ways to get caught.Sometimes you get caught because you couldn't slip your wife her pill last night, so you had to feed her one of your special, homemade brownies.	Who told you guys to do this?
Still, if you don't panic, you can get away with it.	Oh, that that's a tiny marshmallow with writing on it.
Come on, guys. Who put you up to this?	That's why I'm glad you work here, sweetheart.
As for me, I caught my culprit because he made the classic mistake of returning to the scene of the crime. And all because I, too, had been eating Turk's special, homemade brownies.	Come on, guys. Who put you up to this?
Damn it.	Angie, my buddy down in the lab just told me that your urinalysis came back positive for...the birth control pill. So. I will be taking one of these. Thank you!
Hey!	Way too familiar.
You know what I've been doing? I mean, besides listening to my Alanis Morissette CD to get me pumped up to talk to you? Here.	Thank you.
I've been thinking about how completely ridiculous it is that you would take Mr. Kellerman's life into your hands without talking to him.	Yup.
Then why didn't you tell me?	Patients who stay low on the heart transplant list die waiting for one. This way he moves up to the top of the list. Come on!
Allow me to thank you for giving me the opportunity to prove myself. You know what? This is my last one, here.Take it! Whatever happens to this poor guy is on you.s Narration: The next morning was not good. Carla was not talking to Turk. Elliot had dropped by to help not talk to Turk, and I was sneaking out in my undies because my clothes were downstairs in the dryer.	Because you're an attending now. And that doesn't just mean a fat bank account, expensive new toys and a fancy lawyer on retainer for when you kill a prostitute. From now on, the buck stops with you, and I know that you have occasionally bent the rules in this dump over the last couple of years, but you only did it because you knew when the crap started raining down it was damn sure gonna fall on my head. But now, the only way for you to stay out of the trouble storm is for you to go by the book and I've got news for you on that front. By-the-book attendings kill us up here. Newbie, I couldn't tell you about Kellerman because I don't know what type of attending you're going to be.
Morning, friends! Who's ready for some java?	J.D.?
Yes, I am, Carla, because I know when Turk's sad, he likes me to come over in my boxers because he likes to call me his honky Adonis, and that's what friends do.	Are you wearing boxers?
They bought it? Are we that gay?	Yes, I am, Carla, because I know when Turk's sad, he likes me to come over in my boxers because he likes to call me his honky Adonis, and that's what friends do.
Oh, it's my new driving sock.You can borrow.	What's that?
Turk, why?	Actually, J.D.'s been living here secretly.
J.D. didn't want to live here, I begged him.	Because I gotta get those damn judgmental eyes off me!
Oh, thank you! Oh, I lost it.	Hey, it's getting good!
I don't wanna get pregnant! Shoot.	Dude, you're still eating those brownies.
He's my patient, Bob. I'm responsible.	Well, Bobbo, I was going to treat him, but I lost my stethoscope...
What?	Dr. Dorian, I've kept my mouth shut about all the recent sexual harassment complaints because I don't think it's fair to punish a man for making small talk, or say, asking his secretary just once to dress up as a geisha girl and call him Kelso-san.
I guess so.	Nothing. But now I need to know: is this the type of attending you're going to be?
I could tell him there's nothing in my cup and I'm just pretending to drink to seem non-chalant...	Anything else?
No.	I could tell him there's nothing in my cup and I'm just pretending to drink to seem non-chalant...
But instead, I was thinking about what Carla said about moving on. And I wasn't the only one.	No.
Gotta make a quick two-sie.This explains a lot.	J.D.!
Thanks for nothing, assface.	Newbie, I heard your voice.
Wow. Want a hug?	I'm gonna go ahead and give you back one of these man cards. You deserve it.
I'm gonna have a good year, aren't I?	You held onto it as long as you could, didn't you?
And I knew he was right.	Anything can happen.
AARGH!	Excuse me.
For all of us.	AARGH!
Goodnight, Keith. Hey, keep your head up. You're doing a good job.	Very...
Waaaaaagh!	Who am I?!
The perfect setup to a joke, but no one's around to hear!	Get me a small one-pump mocha.
So what did you want me to get you?	Wahh! Dude! Oh God! Waahuh! NOOOO! Dude!
Wasn't that your nickname in high school? Hello! Huh, huh, huh, huh.	A small one-pump mocha?
It was worth it!	Dude, there's a guy upstairs waiting to have his spleen removed.
Not everyone was in hell at their jobs. In fact, there was only one thing Elliot didn't like about her new hospital: Charlie, her co-fellow.	JORDAN!! Oh...
Hippocratic Oath on three! One! Two! Three!	I hate you, Charlie.
There it is! All right, kick some ass today, guys.Except for Mr. Woodson in 302, he's got that rectal tear.	First, do no harm!
We even spent this weekend building a house for the homeless.	You seem to be developing quite the rapport with your interns.
Nice!In my defense, who wears a tie to a construction site?	How'd that go?
Sir, I'd love to chat, but it's already eight. I gotta rock and roll.	Son, when you're an intern you get treated like crap and when you're in a position of power, you do the same thing to them. It's inevitable. Like the tide. Or the awkward toast I'm going to have to give someday at my son's big, gay wedding. Mark my words, eventually you'll treat them like dirt like the rest of us do.
I'm an attending!	I beg your pardon.
How many janitors does it take to change a light bulb? Two.	What?
I'm very funny. Earlier, I made a killer one-pump mocha joke and everybody laughed.	OK, that didn't make any sense. Hank's an electrician. And you are not funny.
Huh, huh, huh. Any-who, have a good one, Lurch.	Wasn't that your nickname in high school? Huh, huh, huh, huh.
I had to skedaddle, because today was burger day in the cafe and that meant one thing: 75 hungry employees and one bottle of ketchup.	Huh, huh, huh. Any-who, have a good one, Lurch.
Got the ketchup.	I had to skedaddle, because today was burger day in the cafe and that meant one thing: 75 hungry employees and one bottle of ketchup.
Hey how come Elliot never invites us over to her hospital?	No, she didn't!
It's true. I even had it.	Honey, a lot of women suffer from that.
Here it is.	You mean multi-ethnic Siamese doctor? Bite, please!
Mmmm. That's headed right to our joint colon.	Mmmm.
So tell me something, Carla, has she invited you to her new hospital?	Yeah, I think I've made my point.
Hmmmm?	So tell me something, Carla, has she invited you to her new hospital?
Victory sip!	Hmmmm?
I gotta go talk to my boys.	I am your new friend, so suck it.
My boys need some ketchup!That's a lot of boys. Rex gets first dibs because I opened his chest with a buzz saw.	Oookay. I'm just...
OK, gang I'll meet you up in radiology to talk about Mr. Heath's CAT scan. His tumor's getting so big it's starting to look like a three-mor.	Oh! Must be your birthday.
Have you been following me around all day dressed like an intern?	Not funny.
Whatever. If it wasn't funny, why did they all laugh?	Yes, and you're a terrible teacher. I'm not prepared to operate on anyone.
That dog just laughed at a pun.	You get it now? Your relationship with your interns is a sham.
The Janitor was wrong. My interns weren't laughing at my jokes just because I'm their boss. It made me think about how some people don't want to just open the door......walk in, and see the truth.	Just got interesting, people!
After all, the truth can reveal the ugliest part of people.	You tell me.
As for me, I already knew exactly what the truth was. Plus, my best friend was always around to back me up.	She wanted to work here, so let her see what it's like to work here. And for God's sake, will you be a man?
How funny is this joke? That patient's tumor is so big, it's starting to look like a three-mor. Huh, huh, huh.	As for me, I already knew exactly what the truth was. Plus, my best friend was always around to back me up.
OK, we're off the property. Now let's talk.	We are in a hospital, man.
We'll catch her up later. Have you guys been fake laughing at my jokes? Be honest. I promise, absolutely no ramifications.	Coming!
Keith, I hope you die a violent death and bugs eat your corpse.	Well, we've been kind of fake laughing.
Unbelievable. From now on, there 's absolutely no laughing at my jokes unless they're particularly hysterical! Talk about your mission impossibles, huh, huh, huh, huh.	Look! Your jokes kinda suck and when I laugh, you pick me to do procedures.
What is it with you and the costumes today?	Case closed.
Gloria.	I'm I'm here!
This is a little trust exercise that I really think is gonna connect us again. Remove your blindfolds, please.See your death, see your death, see your death...Keith...Don't worry, buddy. We're cool.	Then move your big, bald, biscuit head! Some of us don't have cable.
No! See your death.	Really?
Hey! Why don't guys go upstairs and do some work!And for God's sake, will somebody wake up Gloria?OK, enough waving. You wave too much. You abuse waving. Go!	No! But I looked up to you!
Gloria.	There it is, just like I said. I can feel your hatred like a cool spring breeze. Ah!
OK, say it again!	Get off my back, I'm not in the mood. Whoa!
That's what she said! Zoom, zoom, zoom!	Get off my back, I'm not in the mood?
Just because you dye your mustache blonde doesn't mean it's gone.	You've got bug-eyes.
Well...	What's wrong?
We were gonna do "multi-ethnic Siamese doctor has a Fresca," but then Turk started getting on my case about my interns.	Well...
You know what? Put our right hand in front of your face. Now talk to it!	He's mad because they're sucking up to him and I was saying, "Dude, that's the exact same thing you did with Dr. Cox."
As I stood up to go to the men's room with Turk, praying he only had to go one-sies, I thought about the different methods people use to teach.	Dude, get up, I gotta go to the bathroom.
Darryl! He's cool. From now on he's only going to use my credit card for emergencies!	Remember that meningitis patient that stole your identity?
I think it's always easier to be a jerk than a good guy.	Cute.
No, you guys are fine. You're doing a good job.	Did we do something wrong Dr. Dorian?
Still, good guy or not, there's no reason why you shouldn't enjoy the perks.	No, you guys are fine. You're doing a good job.
You know what? I want the laughter back!And you know what, I liked it when you waved, you were always waving...Why don't all of you just wave? All right.	Still, good guy or not, there's no reason why you shouldn't enjoy the perks.
Ultimately, you can deal with anything, as long as you have a group of friends around to go through it all with you.	You know what? I want the laughter back!And you know what, I liked it when you waved, you were always waving...Why don't all of you just wave? All right.
I can't imagine what it would be like if I were all on my own.	Hey, guys. What's going on?
They're called boxers, Carla.	J.D., you have to get out. This place is tiny and I'm sick of seeing your man-panties hanging all over the bathroom.
With a breathable cotton crotch panel.	They're satin, J.D.
King me!	With a breathable cotton crotch panel.
Thoughts: Dude, I know you can't look because Carla's here, but you're missing a crazy Victoria's Secret commercial.	I sense she doesn't want me to tell them. Women have an unspoken connection men can't even fathom.
Whoa, hold your horses.	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa and whoa...
I I hurt her and I'm not very proud.	We have a very complicated past.
I'm a little proud.	I I hurt her and I'm not very proud.
You know, relationships and things of that nature.	We've managed to restore our friendship by staying away from dangerous topics.
Love the superficial. Dynamite teeth today.	J.D. and I keep it superficial.
Sparkly!	Oh, thanks, buddy!
Friday?	Fine, you can't live with Elliot, but you're not living with us, so get your crap out by Friday.
Friday's my birthday! I've already e-vited everyone over to our place.	Friday.
Your place. Look I can't just un-e-vite everyone, I've already gotten two e-yeses and twenty-four e-maybes. That's a lot of e-sponses.	Whose place?
It's a Mexican-themed fiesta on the first anniversary of my 29th birthday. That means I'm turning 30. Donde? 56 Walnut Drive. Cuando? Thank you for asking. Ocho-thirty until upside-down question mark. Sombreros at the door. Arrrrrrrrrooo!	Bambi, I'm gonna put my e-foot up your ass.
Gracias, amigo. I borrowed one of your dictionaries.	I'll be there.
Since there were twelve surgical residents at Sacred Heart fighting for four attending spots, Turk was ass-kissing the senior staff.	Gracias, amigo. I borrowed one of your dictionaries.
You know, I totally saw that coming.	Yeah.
Check it!	Yeah.
I know, but who cares? I got all the time in the world. I mean I'm only turning thirty.	Things to do by thirty: Get married, buy a house, learn the difference between "Senator" and "Congressman." Dude, you haven't done any of these yet.
Where did all of these unsupervised children come from?	Thirty? What's thirty?
I'm afraid of dragonflies. You know what, I'm not gonna make a big deal out of this. Neither one of us has made any headway with our lists.	Dude, you haven't done anything on this list. How could you never have slept naked on a hammock?
I've done nothing. I mean I did learn another language, but it was just that one where you slid a "b" sound in the middle of every single word, and I was never fluent.	First of all, don't lump me in with you, because I'm a surgeon, I'm married, I've had sex while playing Frogger and I'm gonna be a dad. I'm moving through my list.
No-b-t with the la-b-di-b-es...	That secret language was so lame.
When did we lose Mr. Heath?	OK.
Doug, I told you to stop pre-tagging patients.	Oh, we didn't, his vitals are fine.
You wrote a time of death.	It's a slow day in the morgue, nothing's written in stone.
Get out of here!	I wrote one-ish.
Carla, at 6:41 tomorrow evening I turn thirty. I have to find one thing on this list I can do by then.	Why are you so pissy?
Haven't you used that joke like, a trillion times?	Maybe you could swing by our parts department and pick up a pair of testes.
That's it! I'll do the triathlon!	Ignoring him...and switch!
Well, I didn't know anything about cereal-inventing either, Carla. And yet if it wasn't for a harshly-worded cease and desist letter, we'd all be eating J.D.'s Bananas and Nuts.	Oh, you don't know anything about triathlons!
Why is everybody wearing wetsuits?	You're not serious about this, are you?
Honestly, Ted, it doesn't really matter. As long as I finish by 6:41 tonight.	So what's your best time, buster?
The harder you push yourself to do something, the harder it is to back out. Whether you're caught in a lie with your wife...	Honestly, Ted, it doesn't really matter. As long as I finish by 6:41 tonight.
Or whether you're just trying to get your boyfriend to open up.	Love you.
And sometimes, the only thing you can do is just dive in.	Nope!
Ooh! Oh boy, that's cold! Oh God! Ahh! There's a little, here's some more, all right, ease it in, ease it in!	And sometimes, the only thing you can do is just dive in.
As I reached the biking stage and finally realized what chafing was, I got a surprise visitor.	I'm about to ruin my career by plunging a knife into a completely conscious person! But you know what? You're absolutely right. Let's focus on the lying.
Well, my bike is rusty, I haven't been able to feel my genitals since they first touched water, and the only thing I've had to eat all day is half a jellyfish. Why are you here?	How's it going?
That's a dangerous topic, talk to Carla.	Can I talk to you about Jake?
Talking to you violates the two most important tenets of our relationship. One, keep discussions superficial and two, no talking while my boys are straddling chrome. That one's new.	Dinner!
Agh! It's like pedaling in hummus!	Why don't you just try a higher gear?
Oh, thank God, I think the bike part is finally over. Oh no.	See you, buddy!
Whoooooooaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!!! Whoaahhh OOF!	Oh, thank God, I think the bike part is finally over. Oh no.
During the run, dehydration set in.	Let's just forget for one second that hypnosis is used to lower bleeding, help recovering patients deal with pain. You are married now. So start believing what I tell you to believe.And don't pinch me!
They already finished and cooked a pig?	See you at the luau!
Oh, you're real. Although the dolphin costume is a little odd.	Hey, J.D.
Elliot, you know our rules.	This Jake thing is still really bothering me.
This is working.	Yeah, I've been thinking about that. Who wants to have a superficial friendship? And, God, do you remember how close we used to be? Dealing with Dr. Cox,
Well, if he freaked you out, why don't you and talk to him?	Not for me, I want to be able to tell you that my boyfriend really freaked me out.
All right, fine, Elliot. You want to know why? You're just like me. You're scared because you feel like you haven't accomplished anything with your life. But instead of running a triathlon, you're pushing forward with a guy you don't belong with. And you know as well as I do that one of these days, he's going to open up a bottle of white wine for you when you really prefer red, except you never told him that and you want to know why? It's because he's not right for you, Elliot. Are you happy now?	I don't know. You tell me.
Must. Finish. Race.	You're pretty smart for a guy running in bike shoes.
They say that in life, all good things must come to an end. Sometimes it comes quietly...	Small world. Scalpel. Making first incision.Well, here goes.Hmm? All right. Clamp, please!
...and sometimes, not so quietly.	Jake, I think we need to talk.
And suddenly, you realize you've taken something as far as you can go.	You can do this! You can do this! You can do this!
Elliot, I'm thirty years old. I'm single, I'm homeless, and I'm pretty sure I just soiled myself.	J.D., what you said before, I knew you were right. Anyway, I'm sorry I got mad.Thanks. You were wrong about one thing, though. We are moving forward.
Oh, great. Then we'll be two losers under one roof.	Why don't you just move into my place?
A wise man once said the human spirit can overcome any obstacle.	By my watch, you've got eight minutes to finish this thing. Come on!
I can't...	A wise man once said the human spirit can overcome any obstacle.
That man had obviously never run a triathlon.	Come on.
As for me, I could overcome any obstacle, as long as I had Elliot and her ridiculously strong thighs beneath me.	I think I see him.
Woo-hoo! We made it! And with two minutes to spare!	As for me, I could overcome any obstacle, as long as I had Elliot and her ridiculously strong thighs beneath me.
Whoa!	Woo-hoo! We made it! And with two minutes to spare!
Mm-hmm. Will you tell me what Jake's fantasy was?	Promise to help me get through my thirtieth?
Did it involve chains?	Nope.
Whips?	No.
Candle wax?	Mm-mm.
Role-playing?	No.
Lasers?	No.
Was he a Mexican apple thief?	Negative.
She could be half Turk and half Elliot.	Hey, roomie! I'm having the girls from my yoga class over for drinks tonight and FYI, Tina, the tiny brunette just got dumped and she's looking for rebound sex. Honestly, how could I be a better roommate?
I died, Turk-iot. Hellooo!	Hey dog, if you die before me, I'll let you play with my boobies while I finish.
Nothing.	J.D., what are you doing?
I miss having you as my roommate, I don't know!	Dude, what the hell are you doing?
Seeing an intern tell someone they're going to die for the first time is strange. Because even though it's a horrible and sad experience, if they get through it, there's a sense of accomplishment.	Check it out. Keith's telling Mr. Morrison about his brain tumor.
Good job, man. What did you say?	Nailed it! Hell yeah!
Ooh!	Well, I just told him that there's nothing more we can do right now.
"Nothing more we can do right now" implies that there maybe something we can do tomorrow.	What?
Yeah, I'm gonna need you to go back in there and use some form of the word "die." Dead, dying, deadsies, deadwood. Your choice.	That man knows he's doomed!
Deadsies.	What was the middle one?
Did you know cowboys used to curse?	Deadwood?
How do we handle this?	And, we're back. Anyway, I need one of you attendings to introduce me at the dinner, so figure it out.
Unfortunately for you guys, I have the balance of a...	Same way we have for years.First one who falls introduces Kelso.
Careful, you're about to let Dr. Cox know you were a gymnast in high school.	Unfortunately for you guys, I have the balance of a...
Fine. Let's do this. Wheels up.OK, come on Dorian. Find your center. Round the rosy! Hey! I got it! I don't got it!Whoa. Whoa. Reel it in, Take it clockwise, fight your fear!Come on. Come on. Be the chair. You gotta want it Johnny D! You gotta want it! Woooooo!!	Careful, you're about to let Dr. Cox know you were a gymnast in high school.
How the hell would I know?	I don't think you understand the predicament you are in here. Kelso expects a long, glowing testimonial. The kind that make men cheer and women...What is that women do, Newbie?
They swoon.	How the hell would I know?
I'll just say something nice about him that's actually true.	Look, if you get up there and start kissing Kelso's ass, your fellow attendings will forever think of you as a brown-nosing toadie. On the other hand, if you don't pucker up, Kelso will make your life a living hell. You're officially trapped.
Everyone has a human side, Coxy. Even Kelso.	You go do that, and I'll go find God, quit drinking, get in touch with myself emotionally and we'll meet right back here at half past impossible. OK?
You know, Laverne, I'm a doctor. So I'm not really gonna take my psychological evaluations from someone who dispenses them in between watching "Maury" and eating a corn muffin.	The hell he does. I remember a flu epidemic. He lost half a dozen children in one day. Hmm!The second Kelso's foot hits the bottom of those stairs, he doesn't have a care in the world.
OK, that was too mean. Apologize.	You know, Laverne, I'm a doctor. So I'm not really gonna take my psychological evaluations from someone who dispenses them in between watching "Maury" and eating a corn muffin.
Laverne, I...	OK, that was too mean. Apologize.
Ah, the hell with it. She's not gonna forgive you, go for broke!	Laverne, I...
I was watching CNN earlier. Apparently the terror alert in your armpits has been elevated to orange. Oh, no he didn't. Yes, Laverne, he did.	Ah, the hell with it. She's not gonna forgive you, go for broke!
Well, I know a lot.	"Laverne, I'm a doctor." You're a bit of a know it all, aren't you?
Mark Felt, the F.B.I. guy. That's been all over the news for months.	Yeah? Who was Deep Throat?
That's because there's no such thing.	Oh, sorry, rich boy. My TV doesn't get the news. Just the bible channel and some kind of Chinese boxing. I bet you don't know how to play Jiggly Ball.
I knew if I just followed Dr. Kelso around for a little while, he'd eventually do something decent. I'm a master of stealth. I could sneak up on anybody.	Ha ha! I knew you didn't know.
Sir, aren't you being a little paranoid?	Why are you following me?
When did you get an earring?	I was in Nam, you know. They pulled off my fingernails.
I've got to get an earring.Turk, have you heard of Jiggly Ball?	Enid, I'm not cheating on you, this earring is mine.See?It's a hip-hop world, son. Keep up or get out of the way.
I've heard of it, too. It's so awesome that we've both heard of it.	Yeah, it's a game the orderlies made up.
Here it is!	Well, you're just going to have to get him on the phone and tell him that I won't be second opinioned by a clinic doctor who couldn't carry my jock strap! Give me some!
You'd make a pretty girl.	Yeah, I think I know this guy. Is he a cocky, black doctor with a white doctor following him around and looking at him like he's in love?
Ahh, checking Mr. Countertop's heart rate.Memories. Did you know that once Dr. Cox had me give every air conditioning unit in this hospital a pap smear? The wacky thing was, room 403 did have some yeast issues.Oh, Dr. Cox, this intro is killing me. Have you seen Kelso?	I really appreciate that, sir.
Finally, I had something I could say in my speech. Dr. Kelso was an angel.	Deal.
So this is where germs are born...	Look, Lorraine, the sooner you let me have a look at that rash, the sooner we can get you back home...I mean, back on the street, which is your home. Hey, home street home, huh? I'm sorry, Lorraine, that was incredibly insensitive.Frick!
You knew she worked here? I can't believe you kept a secret. Remember before your wedding when you sold me out to Turk?	Elliot, sweetie, nobody but me can understand you.That's just Turk. You know that's how he is.
Turk knew I was joking.	J.D., you showed up drunk at my shower screaming through tears that I'd never be as emotionally connected to him as you are.
Because we're so emotionally connected.	Turk knew I was joking.
It's more obvious to me, baby. I mean, Turk.	It's obvious you are.
How do I not know about this game?	Look, I know this place isn't the greatest, but it's not like I lie awake thinking about being yelled at by Dr. Cox and playing Jiggly Ball with the orderlies.
Can you believe Elliot's working at a free clinic?	This place is crushing my soul.
Dr. Reid?	Who?
That's not even funny.	J.D.?
I don't know why we were running. Because I think we both knew that we couldn't change anything. Because given a choice between a rich guy and a poor guy, it was pretty obvious who Bob Kelso would put in the drug trial and who he'd leave behind.Another banner day at Sacred Heart.A best friend stuck in crappy job...A nice guy slowly dying without a fighting chance...It's a wonder how anyone can walk out of this place with a smile on their face.	Whoa, whoa, you want to hear a weird coincidence? The pathology just came back on Dr. Kelso's rich patient. He has the same brain tumor as your guy, Mr. Morrison.
Maybe though, Dr. Bailey was fired last night.	Honey, there's no money to hire another attending.
There have been times	No, no, no, no, no.
Job back.It's just a beautiful film. Beautiful. Corn?Oh, let me help you. I got it.You're tickling your hands. Wait, stop, you're tickling your hands.	J.D., I don't care if they're able to successfully attach one person's limbs on to another person's body, I am not giving you my hands.
OK, keep going, I enjoy it, actually.Ah, I'm only two and a half years away from chest hands.	Buttery!
See? These are chest hands.	I have to handle this on my own, OK?
Course, yours would be brown.	That's what I'm talking about.
The next day started poorly. I only had eight hours until Kelso's awards dinner and someone else was boxing me out.	Course, yours would be brown.
Dropped a quarter in here.	Nice! Why aren't you mocking him?
Oh, I would never swim in a pond, they're infamous for serpents.	Fine, he's in a pond.
Have you been to the Y on man night? Not me.	You could swim at the Y on Tuesdays. Men only.
Why do you have to go there?	Oh, so now a brother can't swim!
She's the idiot. We're doctors.	Oh my God! I would rather play Jiggly Ball than try to explain this to you two idiots.
What kind of glass is this?Ow?	Are you hearing that?
Can I talk to you for a second?	It's not my job to care, Perry.
Do you remember earlier when I told you I'd never heard of Jiggly Ball? I was joking. I play all the time.	No, I'm busy cleaning.That one always kills.
Get off.	I like this. It's an idiot handle.
Just say no!	As it happens, we're heading out right now to play some Jiggly Ball. Are you in?
Jiggle me in.	Just say no!
Throw?	All right, you're gonna go first. Please enter the Jiggly circle.Everybody else, on my signal prepare to throw.
Oh!There is no such thing as Jiggly Ball, is there?	I want you to think of this as a corn muffin.
Guys, why?	No.
I could see where it would be funny from the outside of the circle.	I got my shift covered!
AAH!!	YAAAAAHHHHH!!
I think there may be something wrong with my spine, because I'm not doing that.	And Turk, you freaked out when the hernia patient listened to me over you, and J.D., you just let the entire hospital pummel you with tennis balls because you were too proud to admit you didn't know what Jiggly Ball was.
Even though I had no clue what I was going to say, Elliot's attitude inspired me to introduce the hell out of Bob Kelso.	Chop-chop, Dorian.
Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Bob Kelso is...	Even though I had no clue what I was going to say, Elliot's attitude inspired me to introduce the hell out of Bob Kelso.
Over the next few weeks, I couldn't help thinking about what I had planned to say in my speech. And about how pride defines who we are.	Did I say he wanted a long introduction? Because Kelso just he just likes it when people say his name. Hope you didn't obsess too much about that, Newbie.
As far as Bob Kelso goes, I know some of the good things he does are for the wrong reasons.	Crap.
Still, I also know that I wouldn't want to have to make any of the decisions that he makes.	I'd like everyone to welcome back Dr. Reid.
But when all is said and done, I like to think he does care a little.	Still, I also know that I wouldn't want to have to make any of the decisions that he makes.
Even if he's too proud to show it.	But when all is said and done, I like to think he does care a little.
And finally, Dr. Kelso's 9AM wrong shoulder tap.	The man's dead, J.D. Show some respect.
Of course, you can't be ready for everything.	Dammit. Every morning, tapping. No one's ever there!
We scoff......And we walk away.	Hey! Help me move this weekend.
When is this joyous occasion?	Weird.
Oh, I see. Family only, everyone, that's how they're doing it.	You're not invited.
I am honored.	Newbie, give me a break. Of course you're going. As a matter of fact, I'd I'd like you to be the boy's godfather.
I'm not sure I see how that's funny.	I am lying.
Of course I knew that, Turk, I'm a doctor.	Carla gave it to me. She's got me on twenty-four hour baby-making alert, and we haven't had sex since her last ovulation. Did you know that women only do that once a month?
Once a month? That's crazy!	Of course I knew that, Turk, I'm a doctor.
Ooh, Cassie's pretty.	I don't know why I even bother ovulating. Little Haley doesn't have a chance this month. I name my eggs, big frick. Last month, it was Cassie.
Hi, I'm J.D. I'm sure Perry's spoken of me.	Ahh! Here for the baptism. I remember my son, Harrison's big day. All of us laughing at him in his frilly little baptism dress. Well, we're not laughing anymore, Harrison's a poofter. Bob Kelso.
Nothing about taking a talented go-getter under his wing, or being a surrogate father to a boy who's lost his own? Nothing about that at all, I'm surprised. That's interesting to me, but OK.	No...
Don't cry in front of people.	Nothing about taking a talented go-getter under his wing, or being a surrogate father to a boy who's lost his own? Nothing about that at all, I'm surprised. That's interesting to me, but OK.
Oh, they don't talk much, everybody. There's no talking in the family.	Perry and I don't talk much.
What does he find irritating about you?	I'm honestly not sure which one of you I find more irritating.
I'm not sure why it was suddenly so awkward, but I wish something would break the tension.	I embrace the Lord, Jesus Christ as my personal savior.
That's how he likes it.	Hallelujah! A brother's 'bout to have some sex. Ha-Ha-Hallelujah! A brother's 'bout to have some seeeeeex! Smack the money maker! Smack it!
He's married, so it's strictly procreation sex! His wife's throwing her legs up in the air because they're trying for a boy....Like Jesus.	Awww, sex time, people!
She's dynamite. How'd you end up with a born-again Christian sister?	OK. I'm gonna go say hi to Jordan.
Probably the room to room thing.	I don't know. Maybe the TV was broken one day and she picked up the bible instead and found it to be just a darn good read. Or maybe it had something to do with our mother's ability to watch silently as our dad drunkenly knocked us from room to room. What do you think there, Newbie?
It's always hard to find the right words in a moment like this.	Uh-huh.
Dr. Cox, if it makes you feel any better, at the baptism I'll be there to keep Paige company.	It's always hard to find the right words in a moment like this.
Dammit! Stupid baptism.	Yeah. You're not going.
He's just mad because I won't help him move.	Oh, hey fellas, I'm trying to give someone the evil eye over there. Would you mind breaking it up so I can...you understand.Thanks, fellas, very nice of you. Appreciate it. Thank you.
And then it occurred to me. This was the perfect opportunity to take an enemy and turn him into a friend.	My son, Harrison, dabbles in sadomasochism and he has a new gimp named Barry. Or is it Larry? At my age it's getting harder and harder to keep track of his gimps.
I'll do it.	And then it occurred to me. This was the perfect opportunity to take an enemy and turn him into a friend.
No I'm not. Stop doing that. Peanut butter egg dirt!	I knew you would. You're very predictable.
It's never easy to tell a family that medicine isn't working.	Newbie, let's go, Mr. Donnelly's test results are in.
Oh no.	There's always prayer.
Hey, do you guys like improv? Because I'm kind of an expert. There's a game we play in class where you make up what people are saying. Like, watch: Do you want some pie? Not me, I hate pie. What are you talking about? Who hates pie? Everyone loves pie. I've always hated pie! You never understood me. You're a pie racist! Well, you're a cobbler whore!	Oh, right, because people who believe in God are crazy. And you're the sane one.
For God's sake, get off pie!	Hey, do you guys like improv? Because I'm kind of an expert. There's a game we play in class where you make up what people are saying. Like, watch: Do you want some pie? Not me, I hate pie. What are you talking about? Who hates pie? Everyone loves pie. I've always hated pie! You never understood me. You're a pie racist! Well, you're a cobbler whore!
Pie.I've got to find an improv class that doesn't meet in the back of a pie shop.	Republican.
Ar you actually complaining about getting to have sex? Because that is so insensitive, Turk.	Ugh. Dammit, I've gotta go have ovulation sex again.
Let me feel my feelings, Turk! We worked on this!	J.D...
Morning, sunshine!	Continue.
Noted. That was quite a fight you had with your sister yesterday. Won't it be a little awkward when you show up at St. Mary's cathedral on the corner of Maple and Pine, right across from Temple Oheb Shalom at 4 PM today?	Never. Say that. Again.
Mark my words, when that little bastard is dipped in water, I will be there.	That's not where the baptism is, but nice try.
You don't have to rub it in her face.	Anyway, I just invited Paige to come by, Mr. Donnelly's labs came back. It looks like the steroid is finally working. If you happen to be keeping score at home, that would be Medicine: 1, God: 0.
Actually, there was.	Yeah, and I don't have to stick Dr. Kelso's stethoscope down my pants every morning, but I still do. Now isn't there some other relationship out there you could be trying to fix?
Morning, sunshine.	Actually, there was.
Nobody seems to.	I don't like that.
I hope I can find a way to connect with him.	Well, come on. Let's grab some boxes and get to moving, huh?
You're welcome, friend.I gotta say, you've got a lot of Asian art around here.	Thanks for saving that. That's one of my favorite pieces.
Doesn't sound crazy at all.	When I was kid, I always thought I'd travel the world, you know? So after college, I went to China. Did all the normal touristy things, I saw the Great Wall, ate the food, had a baby with a local. You know, just the regular stuff. Anyway, I guess I decorate my place this way because it reminds me of a more optimistic time. That probably sounds crazy.
And like that, I was in.	Thanks, buddy.
Long story short, after confirming it with my bunk mates, that counselor and his "friendship lotion" were transferred out of our cabin and we never spoke about it again.	Man!
We're as thick as two thieves in a pod.	Well, what doesn't kill you...
Thanks, pal.	OK. Time to move some of the heavier stuff. So you might want to put on these gloves. And the attic upstairs has a lot of fiberglass in it. So here's a hat.
I figured out why I'm so great at managing relationships. I don't rub things in people's faces.	Sure, bud.
I never go to bed very, very mad.	You big jerk!
And I've always known that if I make the slightest gesture of friendship to a difficult coworker...	Angry sex is awesome.
...I'll end up robbing an Asian couple's house.	Who are you?
Now that I'm on the lam, I thought about two things. One, what my prison name would be...	Worth it!
Gizmo.	Now that I'm on the lam, I thought about two things. One, what my prison name would be...
And two, whether some relationships were beyond repair. Then fate threw me another curve.	Gizmo.
Hey, who's your friend?	And two, whether some relationships were beyond repair. Then fate threw me another curve.
Well, seeing as he gave me the strength to outrun the Sheriff's K-9 unit, I'd say he's my new god.You can rub mine's belly if I can rub yours.	My boy in a dress. Who's yours?
He seems fine.	There will be no whining or crying while we sit here, understood?
I don't whine or cry.	I wasn't talking to him.
These are coasters.	Really. How do you explain these photos of you whining and crying as you run away from the Kwan's apartment?
You turned me into a felon!	My camera's broken.
No, thank you. If there's one thing I learned from this guy, it's that I need to stop trying to fix people's relationships.	You know what, there, Newbie? You can go to the baptism. Take Jack. Jordan will kill me if he's not there. Plus, I know you. You're exactly one watered-down appletini away from trying to fix my sister and me.
Still. I've never know you to judge a person based on their beliefs. In fact, you're pretty tolerant of everyone. Except Hugh Jackman.	You're welcome.
I just don't understand why your sister being religious bothers you so much.	Eh.
Then why are you so angry?	It doesn't.
Sometimes I think it takes a child to make you see the light.	OK, look. You two stop fighting or I will turn this church around.
So maybe relationships can be fixed. Whether it's by coming around to your spouse's way of thinking.	Yeah, it was.
Or by reassuring the Kwan's that their big guy didn't desert them.In the end, you just have to be willing to take the first step.	Aww, Turk, a little help.
Around here, everyone has some sort of morning ritual. Whether it's getting help on the daily word jumble from the dyslexic tracheotomy patient...	Hello!
...Cursing out an innocent orderly over a stolen physical therapy tub....	Save your voice, Marcia. Mm. Save it.
...Or for some, just a relaxing afternoon soak on the roof.	Dammit, you'd better find it! Physical therapy tubs don't just disappear!
Wah! My eyes!Well, yeah, it hurts. But when you accept the keys to the hog, you become a lifetime member of the danger club. Excuse me, fine ladies. I've got lives to save.	You try to get in here wearing that thing and I'm gonna give you a four-story atomic wedgie.
Yeah, well he's six. What's he gonna do, kick my ass?	Ronald's gonna be mad.
Again.	Yeah, well he's six. What's he gonna do, kick my ass?
For doctors, pain is complicated. Every patient handles it differently, depending on their race...	Hey, check this guy's chart out. He says he's been in pain for, like, three months.
...gender...	Does what hurt?
...or even their sex life.	Ow! I just bit the inside of my lip! Agh! Nothing's ever hurt so badly!
And since there's no way to truly gauge how much pain someone's in, we have to rely on an archaic chart.	OHHHHHH....yeah, that feels good.
That's a ten.	What's a ten?
All right, everybody, last one here has to do a double shift this weekend.Keith! Looks like you just lost your weekend.	Mmm...Blueberry-cran-carrot-zucchini-poppy-seed-chocolate chip!
Lisa, call that androgynous husband of yours and tell him or her you're mine this weekend.	What? I totally beat Lisa.
OK, my bad, so we're not crystal clear on the ground rules. OK, tomorrow it will be the last one to touch my face. Nah, I'm not gonna like that. The last one to touch my bot No, that's probably illegal. I tell you what, I'll just email everyone. That's what I'll do. This day and age that's what you do. OK, over here. Guys, Mr. Jenkins spent all night without being treated. Now, I know he's homeless and smell's like an obese man's twosie.	But I feel like I edged out James.
Sorry, thought you were dozing. The thing is, guys, it doesn't matter if he's a homeless guy or some senile old racist.	Hey!
Immigrants, Mr. Bursick. You hate all immigrants.	Which people do I hate again?
I don't have time, Mr. Bursick. Guys, if I give you a patient, I expect you to work your butts off for him. And P.S., Mr. Jenkins is a Vietnam vet. So let's take care of him like he took care of our nation. Get out of here!That's how you light a fire under their butts, Perry, you get 'em going with some inspiration!	And why do I hate
Because she's my patient.	Too much talking, too much talking, too much talking, too much talking, too much talking, too much talking. Why did you order a BMP test on my patient, Mrs. Wilk, last night?
and *I* treated her last night.	Interesting, seeing as *I* admitted her
Because they're stealing all of our jobs, Mr. Bursick, stealing all of our jobs. Perry, we've spent an equal amount of time on Mrs. Wilk, and seeing as we're both attendings, i.e. equals, why don't we let her decide who her doctor is, huh?	Dr. Dorian, why do I hate all
Oh my God. Oh, my God, I don't even believe it! I don't believe it! I don't believe it-lieve it-lieve it! Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo! Yes! I'm shaking, look at this. It's crazy talk.	I choose Dr. Dorian.
I was a premie.	He played hearts with me all night.You're a very strange young man, aren't you?
Then Elliot did what every good doctor does when they're truly stumped. She pawned him off.	GUUHH!
And then Turk said what every surgeon says when they're not sure what to do.	Ha. Turkleton!
Hellooo! If you're wondering what a thank-you-for-being-my-doctor card from Mrs. Wilk looks like, it looks a little something like this.	You'll be there. You'll all be there.
Oops. This one's actually from my Aunt Judy and her lady friends. Must have grabbed the wrong card.	"Happy Anniversary, gals?"
Oh, right, your imaginary warning light. Don't be mad, Perry, this day was bound to come. See, I've studied you. I've taken your best qualities and my best qualities and I've combined them into something even better. Much the way that iced tea and lemonade were joined to become an Arnold Palmer. Incidentally, has anyone ever done less to become famous? I mean, yea for me, I mixed two drinks together.	Uhh, Newbie...
I'm sure he has lots of hobbies, Perry. The man's a drink mogul.	Arnold Palmer is a golfer.
In a hospital, even the best of moods can be ruined by somebody handing you a chart.	I'm sure he has lots of hobbies, Perry. The man's a drink mogul.
Do you have any family, Mrs. Wilk?	In a hospital, even the best of moods can be ruined by somebody handing you a chart.
Look, Mrs. Wilk, you have something called systemic amyloidosis. Now, it's in your liver now, but eventually it will shut down all your organs. There's a treatment, but it's very invasive, and at best, it'll just give you a little more time.	No. I was married twice. Divorced one, the other one died. Wrong one died.
Say no more. I'm gonna take amazing care of you.	Well, I've had a great life son.
Pretty crappy. I just had to tell an old lady she's dying. How about you?	How's it going today, buddy?
I always wondered what exploratory surgery was like.	OK. Elliot turfed this chronic pain patient to me. I have no idea what's wrong with him, so I have to do exploratory surgery.
Watch out for colon darts.	I've made the first incision. I'm going in.Nurse! Hat!Colon. Why did it have to be the colon?Removing the golden tumor.Ladies...They knew the risks.
It's weird, it's like everyone was lured out here by the thing they want most in the world.	Where's the boobie-touching booth?
What are you doing here?	...and, three.
Because I want to make sure you're as comfortable as possible.'	Why did that sweaty attorney ask me if my affairs were in order?
For the place that you're going. You know, the big, puffy, clouds? The bright lights? All your old friends?	I'm going to sit for this.
No, no, no, not not Seattle. The you know, the dying peacefully place.	Seattle?
This morning you told me you'd had a great life.	Now, I'm going to stand.
Oh, this is just a misunderstanding, I'm so sorry. Tell it was a misunderstanding, that...	Exactly, and I'd like to continue it.
It can mean you're not sorry at all.	I'm sorry.
And sometimes "I'm sorry" can mean your services are no longer needed.	Yeah.
What?	Hand over your stethoscope.
I find this highly unprofessional.	In victory, I get your stethoscope. It's a trophy. You're lucky we're not back in olden times. I'd have made a necklace out of your teeth.
I gotta get Mrs. Wilk back.When did we have a shade remote? I didn't know we had shade remotes.	Now I'm going to check on Mr. Jenkins, your war hero. I feel he, too, deserves a competent doctor. In fact, I'm gonna take all of your patients, and consequently, your only reason for getting out of that lacy, over-pillowed, four poster virgin cocoon you call a bed every morning.
Vampire doctors? How did he hear about my screenplay?	Aww, either your picture didn't come out, or we got a hospital full of vampire doctors.
Ms. Brooks, your blood work looks fine. But I'd like to take one more sample. Just for me.You know, you taste a little anemic. Get that down to the lab, buddy.	I actually love these.
That's what they call me. How you doing?The end.	Right away, Dr. Acula.
He's both. And at the very end, I'm gonna put "Dr. Acula" across the screen, take that period, get it out of there. Squish it together, it'll say "Dracula"	So Dr. Acula is a doctor *and* a vampire?
Um, thank you for telling me what I already know, Turk.	That is an awesome ending!
AHH! My screenplay!	Probably not.
You just lit your pipe on my title page.	Hey, sport!
She said "I've lead a great life." And every doctor in the world knows that's code for "I'm ready to die."	I heard Mrs. Wilk gave you the axe.
OK, there's no way to answer that and not get in trouble. Change the subject.	How old do you think I am, Dorian?
Sir, I would be honored if you and Enid would join me at my place on Sunday for some homemade jambalaya.	OK, there's no way to answer that and not get in trouble. Change the subject.
Oh my God, he's actually thinking about it. Change the subject back!	Well, it would be good for Enid to get out of the house.
You're seventy-eight, sir.	Oh my God, he's actually thinking about it. Change the subject back!
Jambalaya.	You think I'm that old?
Really.	I'm fifty-seven, numb nuts.
Who?	I know they say fifty-seven is the new forty.
Brookstone? Were you looking for gadgets, sir?	But lately it seems all people see when they look in my direction is some old guy. Hell, just last week I was in the mall hanging out in Brookstone's and some kid asked me if I was lost.
Oh.	If that's what you trolling for mall ass, then yeah.
Turk did that in college on a bet.	I should have just believed Mr. Peele. I mean it's not like somebody poos their pants for no reason.
Sometimes when you're feeling guilty, it's like a storm cloud over your head.	Carla did not know that story. Thank you.
I knew there was only one way to make the guilt storm go away.Mrs. Wilk, I'm sorry.Mrs. Wilk, I just wanted to say I was wrong to think that you wouldn't want to try every possible treatment there is, to avoid, you know, the place. You know, there's clouds and...Space Needle...Seattle.	Sometimes when you're feeling guilty, it's like a storm cloud over your head.
You're welcome. You got a lot of pluck for an older gal.	Yes, you were. Thank you.
Jambalaya!	How old do you think I am?
There are a lot of ways to make amends.It can be as simple as including someone...	Jambalaya!
...Or as complicated as committing to a difficult journey.	Thanks.
The important thing is to regain the respect of your peers.	Thank you.
Thank you.	Say, Newbie. I uh, I gotta hand it to you. It took the heart of a lion to apologize to Mrs. Wilk like that.
Really? You've been spending a lot of time treating my guy, Mr. Jenkins, right?	Of course it took the incompetence of a bewildered jackass to make that error to begin with. Never make assumptions based on your own perceptions. Just never do it.
Yeah, actually he's just a homeless guy. I made up the war veteran story to motivate my boys. But, what are you gonna do?Oh, come on, you've gotten me like a hundred times. I finally got you once. It was bound to happen, right?	Yeah, he's a Vietnam veteran. He deserves as much.
Even though it sucks being paged to the hospital by an intern, there's nothing I like more than riding my scooter, Sasha, through puddles after a rain.	Mango body butter?
Here comes a big 'un!	Even though it sucks being paged to the hospital by an intern, there's nothing I like more than riding my scooter, Sasha, through puddles after a rain.
Where was I?You're not aware of any sort of odd, underground canal system beneath the hospital, are you? I think I saw a manatee.	Here comes a big 'un!
We didn't exchange pleasantries.	Was his name Julian?
What's red for?	That's Julian. Watch it, wet paint. Kelso's starting a new line system to help people get around. Green's gonna go to the smoker's lounge, blue to the ICU, and yellow to all the exits.
OK, I'm here. What's the emergency Keith?	Sneaker painting.
They're the exact same thing. Every doctor here knows that. Why would you page me?	Uh, do you want Mr. Fleming on unfractionated or low molecular weight Heparin?
Sir, I'm not even supposed to be here.	Dorian, I need you to do the residents' call schedule for next month.
Done, and I am outta here.Dammit!Keith, you've got to stop paging me for totally unimportant things!Ohhh! That man's chest cavity is completely open. I can see his heart beating.	That's what I'm talking about.
Good page, good page!	He sneezed and all his surgical staples popped out!
Ever since her fellowship, Elliot loved that her interns saw her as an endocrinology expert.	OK, rock-tors. That's my name for doctors who rock. Next patient.
Here's some!	Oh, really? Well you never went to assface school, but you seem to be an expert at that. Am I right?
I didn't know what I was high-fiving, I gotta stop doing that.	You're going to high-five that? Bi-hig mistake.
No.	Did you eat my mango body butter?
I shmeared it on a bagel.	No.
Ted, I'm a little busy, OK? Toodles.	My band has decided we're only singing songs from classic movies now.
Even though I was happy for Elliot, the endocrinology expert, I still couldn't figure out how she knew so damn much.	Ah. Mmm. Hold on, I just have to blow my nose.
When a career opportunity is slipping through their fingers, even a doctor can succumb to one of the basest human impulses.	We're just not sure, Dr. Turk.
They can lie.	You know, I've donated an organ.
OK, the coast is clear. Just a few more steps and you're out of here.	We're going to check on our son.
What are you talking about? You're the most maternal person I know.	J.D., I have to admit this to somebody. I don't like kids!
Well, if you don't want a baby, Carla, don't have a baby.	I'm a nurse, J.D., I'm trained to fake it. I just don't understand whats so adorable in "Yay, you made a poopie in the potty!" I'm supposed to be impressed? There's a monkey at the zoo who can do that. I mean, you know, when he's not playing with himself.
A hospital can sometimes feel like a magical place, where people's hopes and dreams are often far from ordinary.	Dude, you gotta help me out.
Whether they're looking for brains, a heart, or courage. As for me, I was just gonna keep on following that yellow line and hope I'd eventually get back home.	A hospital can sometimes feel like a magical place, where people's hopes and dreams are often far from ordinary.
Turk, Toto and I are going home.	Dude, it was awful. I couldn't stop lying to them. I only have two moves. If surgery goes well, the fake-modest nod and wink. Now, if surgery goes bad and the guy dies, there's always the head-shake-sad-walkaway.
OK, I'll help.	Fine!
Just try to imagine what they're going through. I mean sometimes I think about what it's gonna be like when you die.	Thank you! Now how do I tell those people to let their so go?
Right, and where do we meet up in heaven?	Because you think I'm going first because of my diabetes.
I'll see you there, player! I love religion. The point is, Turk, if someone tried to pull the plug on you without being totally honest with you, you know where they'd end up?	At the milkshake pool on the lesbian cloud.
Next to the super-high, unreachable cupcake table.	In hell, watching The View.
After trying to get out of the hospital vertically, I decided to go the horizontal route: hiding in a body bag.	Next to the super-high, unreachable cupcake table.
Can you press "lobby," please?	After trying to get out of the hospital vertically, I decided to go the horizontal route: hiding in a body bag.
OWW!! OWW!! OWW!!! DOUG! Why are you hitting me?!?	GYAAAAAHHHH-DAH!!!
Then why were you hitting me?!	Because I thought you were a dead guy coming back to life!
No, no! Elliot, I'm not even supposed to be here, I'm going home!	There, you are. Come on.
OK, you knew he's an athlete of some kind. Just say something general.	J.D., there is just no way that I'm going to be able to pull this off. In a few hours, I'm going to have a room full of specialists firing questions at me. I gonna be a bigger fraud than Barry Bonds!
Still, I love it when Bonds wins at the game that he plays. Look, Elliot, you know how people become specialists? They obsess about the material over and over again until it becomes lodged into their brains. That's exactly what you've been doing. Watch, where's the closest page you've hidden around here?	OK, you knew he's an athlete of some kind. Just say something general.
Wha-? You are good.	Hmm.
All right look. What's the leading differential in an obese woman suffering from amenorrhea and hirsutism?	Hmm.
Every so often, a wizard comes along and tells you exactly what you need to hear.	Turn it over.
That's right! See? You had the brains all along.	Superior vena cava?
Yep!	Hey, Dorothy. Going home, are you?
The wall! Hide behind the wall!NO! Sasha!	Get out of the way! The store's being robbed!Freeze!
There was a wall! What's the matter with you?Who is still shooting? She's down!It's over!	All right! All right! OK.
Oh, don't be such a baby, it's a magnetic image. I apologize, Mr. Foster, I'm a little upset. My scooter, Sasha was assassinated this morning.	Is this gonna hurt?
Oh come on, Turk, it was just a joke. And I only wore it for one week.	Yeah, he was so attached to that thing. He used to wear a bracelet that said "Sasha Forever."
Now let's fire this baby up.OK, so I still wear the bracelet.	Whatever.
Was it naughty?	What did you do?
When women want men to completely zone out, there's always one thing they can talk about.	Was it naughty?
Shoe shopping.	You see, uh, yesterday I went shoe shopping and there was this one pair of...
Huh?	So, we kissed? I've been treating his kid for a week and we just really hit it off, you know? I mean it started off with some pretty innocent flirting, "Hi, I'm Dr. Reid," "Why is there blood in my son's stool?"
Shoe shopping.	Strappy sandals.
Were they D's?	Cool. Oh, I almost forgot. Lace bra.
Good news, Mr. Foster. The radiologist said your scan is completely clear, but we'd like to keep you here for a few more tests.	Be specific.
A lot of weird things can happen in a hospital. Like Doug not getting a dead body out of his bed before rigor mortis sets in.	Whatever you say, doc.
Still, the weirdest thing is when a really cool guy who's fine and talking to you one minute...	Ted?
...is dead the next. Of course, in hospitals this happens a lot, so you have to shake it off and move on. Except when this happens.	Still, the weirdest thing is when a really cool guy who's fine and talking to you one minute...
You really gotta change that cellphone ring.	Well! If it isn't the four horsewomen of the apocalypse. There's a Morbidity and Mortality conference tomorrow morning to figure out who is responsible for Mr. Foster's death and here's the exciting news. I'm pretty sure it was one of you.
With Morbidity and Mortality conferences, the first question sets the tone for the whole day.	You think so, huh? Mom, not now.
Yes.Mic check, mic check.Yes.	Dorian, you admitted Mr. Foster with coughing and shortness of breath. Is that correct?
Uh, Mr. Foster had recently flown to India, where had been exposed to an outbreak of pertussis. I was going to check on his labs, but first I had to visit another patient, Mr. Sutton.So, Mr. Sutton, when you came with heartburn, I bet you thought I'd kick your butt right out of here. But not this guy. I admitted you and I stayed up all night studying your EKG because I had a hunch, and no girlfriend. But it was mostly the hunch thing. And that hunch paid off because if I hadn't found that blocked artery, you'd be dead right now.	And then what happened?Dorian. I'm ten feet away from you. Talk.
And here comes the gratitude. The two words every doctor lives to hear.	Uh, Mr. Foster had recently flown to India, where had been exposed to an outbreak of pertussis. I was going to check on his labs, but first I had to visit another patient, Mr. Sutton.So, Mr. Sutton, when you came with heartburn, I bet you thought I'd kick your butt right out of here. But not this guy. I admitted you and I stayed up all night studying your EKG because I had a hunch, and no girlfriend. But it was mostly the hunch thing. And that hunch paid off because if I hadn't found that blocked artery, you'd be dead right now.
I can't believe he didn't thank me. You'll thank me when you leave, won't you?	Later, dude.
Oh, OK, Turk. Looks like someone's getting crossed off their 2:00 spot and getting penciled in for never. How does that feel, does it sting?	Dude, he keeps a hug schedule with his friends.
He's hurting. Hug him. Hug him now!	Oh, OK, Turk. Looks like someone's getting crossed off their 2:00 spot and getting penciled in for never. How does that feel, does it sting?
Thanks for inviting me over, Janitor.	Why?
Can opener!	Anytime, buddy! Anytime. Wait for him, wait for him.
Something feels pinchy. WHOA! AAH! WAAAH!! AAAAHH!!	The lobster's in the pot! Devour! Devour!
Me? Floating-Head Doctor.	Anyway, that explains why I went into the room and said...What would you do with a hundred million dollars?
Yeah, I'd spend the money researching how to successfully separate my head from my body. That way I could literally be in two places at once.	Here we go.
Looking good, Mr. Henderson. Looking real good, Nurse Meyers.Uh-oh, he's flat-lining! Body, come!Dammit! Starting CPR.Oww!	Yeah, I'd spend the money researching how to successfully separate my head from my body. That way I could literally be in two places at once.
Well, there would probably be some kinks to work out initially.	Looking good, Mr. Henderson. Looking real good, Nurse Meyers.Uh-oh, he's flat-lining! Body, come!Dammit! Starting CPR.Oww!
Elliot, would you do me a favor and cover Mr. Foster for me? I have to go to Mr. Sutton's house and get the thank you I deserve.	Hey, guys. 'Sup?
They waffle ironed my foot. But this different, buddy. Look, I need a ride.	It's like the time you were convinced that the cafeteria workers were giving you small waffles. How'd that work out for you?
Oh, pass, huh? Well this is what happened last time you passed.	Pass.
This is where Sutton lives, right? Let's get in there.	Yi.
OK. Just back away slowly.Oh no, Turk. They're organized!AAAHH!!	J.D...Dude?
And there it was. Hope. Dr. Kelso's inability to deal with hunger was legendary. We were as good as home.	Good lord, Bobbo, was that your stomach?
Well, sir, fortunately for us ostriches are flightless birds.There goes the sentry. Every three minutes, like clockwork.	And then what happened, Dr. Dorian?
Here comes your vanilla bear!	Dude, can I admit something to you? I kind of missed not getting my hug today.
Wooohhh!!	J.D., J.D., uh, J.D.!
Oh, thank God.	Oh! Dude, don't sweat it. It says here that the ostrich is generally a docile creature.
What?! I'm coming back up!Turk?WAAAAHHH!!Mr. Sutton, I hope this isn't a bad time.	It also says their kick can kill a man.
Why ostriches?	Ugh, why did I make him Jewish? My parents will kill me.
OK look, Mr. Sutton, I'm sure you're wondering why...	They're such majestic creatures, don't you think? And, you know, they're kind of like my children. Plus, I make belts out of their necks.
You OK? Did you try and escape?	There *is* a door.
Oh.	I did escape. There was one waiting in the car.
Mr. Sutton, I cured you and you never thanked me.	That's Leon. Loves car rides. Likes to stick his head out the window and I tell him it's a little too dangerous, but he doesn't listen to me.
I just don't see why it's such a big deal for you to say, "hey, doc..." Why did he just walk away like that?	Stupid bird stole my hat.
Ruh-roh.	Uhh..
I do admit, he looks pretty phat in your Kango.	Don't move.
Yes! Jabbar'e has been added to the hug schedule. You want to wait with me?	Dude, are you really gonna sit here all day just to thank your garbageman?
This whole experience got me thinking about the nature of gratitude. I guess in the end...	I can't, I was supposed to be on call five minutes ago.
...whether you're a doctor or a garbageman...	This whole experience got me thinking about the nature of gratitude. I guess in the end...
Sorry, sir, uh, um, sometimes I like to just sum things up.	Dorian. What are you doing?
After a day like today, there's only one thing you could do.	Working from an inaccurate report, there was nothing any of you could have done to prevent Mr. Foster from passing. Which, I guess, leads us to you, Dr. Flannery.
To bad radiologists!	After a day like today, there's only one thing you could do.
It's never easy when someone accuses you of screwing up. Especially when you know it's true.And when that happens, you can't shrug it off. Because the best way to learn from your mistakes is to carry them with you.	Oh. Because you were lucky. You know as well as I do that it could have been any one of your faults. Congrats again. Have a uh, have a swell party.
Well, Mrs. Nichols, it was an honor being your doctor.	Excellent. OK, we'll be in touch.
Oh, thank you, but I'm not big on blind dates, and I know, I haven't hit it in awhile, but there's good reason for that.	Oh, you're such a nice young man. I'd love to set you up with my grand-niece.
Sticks and stones may break my bones!	Two good reasons. His face and his personality.
But words will hurt forever.	Sticks and stones may break my bones!
Anyway, for me to be set up with your niece, I'd need to know a lot more about her.	But words will hurt forever.
My blind date should be here any second. I gotta thank Mrs. Nichols for setting this up.Oh, Mrs. Nichols, you blue-haired bitch! Wait, she's veering off. Phew!OK, Mrs. Nichols, your new hip is on the house because this girl is amazing! Yet there's something accessible about her. I wonder what it is.	She's single.
So, she was a bit of a klutz.	Ooh, I'm gonna have the carrot cake.
No.	Did you see that? Please say no.
From that moment on, it was the greatest date ever. We had so much in common.	No.
Me too! Do you ever, like, drift off and have weird fantasies?	I ride a scooter, I love Harry Potter so much I sometimes wish I was a wizard, and I've hated sports since I was a kid.
So do you wanna see if they'll give us more coffee or do you just want to call it a night?	Sometimes.
And then she gave the world's best answer.	So do you wanna see if they'll give us more coffee or do you just want to call it a night?
My roommate. Back in one second.	J.D., you home?
Ha! Why don't you ask her if our date sucked. She's in my room.	So, I guess your date sucked, huh?
Unlikely! Because what's waiting for me in my room is what's known in football terms as a slam dunk .	Twenty bucks you blow it in less than five minutes.
OK, double or nothing. I bet you I can jump from this couch to the counter. Check it! Eagle!	I was Elliot. Twenty bucks, please.
Like when?Are you getting thicker? You feel a little thicker. What?Fine, I may have told her that she smells like my mom. Which, by the way, I still maintain is a compliment.	Yeah, I'm sure you said something that sucked all of the romance out of the moment. You used to do that all the time when we were dating.
Well...	What are you guys talking about?
I convinced Julie to meet me by explaining that my comment in the bedroom was a simple miscommunication.	I know. But he is so damn talented.
I wasn't saying that you smelled like my mom, I was saying that you smelled like memum. It's an exotic flower that's indigenous to the hills of Costa Rica.	I convinced Julie to meet me by explaining that my comment in the bedroom was a simple miscommunication.
Hugsies.	God, I feel so stupid.
Ohh, Mommy.	Hugsies.
Yes.	I'll see you later?
It does, it happens.	Oh no, it happens.
Isn't she great?	Bye.
You're telling me what to say, next you're gonna be telling me how to kiss her. I mean, where does it end?	So, you got the second date. Just don't repeat the same mistakes you made with me. For instance, don't speed down the road and pretend your brakes are out. I don't care if it got you laid once in high school. It is not funny, and I still have not forgiven you for killing that family's pony. But most importantly, if you ever find yourself in a romantic situation again, ignore whatever pops into your head. Just look into her eyes and say these exact words: I'm. So glad. I found you.
Stay away from my girlfriend, Elliot. And stay away from my J.D. wigs!	Mmm, right back at'cha. And I love that you're calling me J.D.
I am having so much fun hanging out with you. Can you believe we've been talking for two hours?	Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha, no he won't!
Nah, while you were in the bathroom I set the clock two hours ahead so you'd think time was just flying by.	Seriously?
Looking at her, I knew what the future held for Julie and me.	Really? While I was in the bathroom, I wrote my name on the mirror with my finger so the next time you took a hot shower and it fogged up, you'd think that ghosts where trying to tell you to be with me.
Smile.	Looking at her, I knew what the future held for Julie and me.
Thanks for doing that.I wanted a picture of us old, you know? That way if one of us dies in a tragic skiing accident, we'll always have that memory of us together.	Oh, God this mask is hot.
OK, romance is in the air. You gotta say something. Tell her about the hit and run. Nah, she probably loves ponies. Ask her if she's been tested. Why are all these odd thoughts popping into my head? My, God, look at the size of her feet. Tell her! Stop it! OK, the silence is going on too long. Just say that thing that Elliot told you, even though it's stupid.	That's so sweet! So what do you want to do now?
I'm really glad I found you.	OK, romance is in the air. You gotta say something. Tell her about the hit and run. Nah, she probably loves ponies. Ask her if she's been tested. Why are all these odd thoughts popping into my head? My, God, look at the size of her feet. Tell her! Stop it! OK, the silence is going on too long. Just say that thing that Elliot told you, even though it's stupid.
Ahhhh, morning, Elliot. By the way, Julie's here. I'm not gonna kiss and tell.	It's not like you're the king around here.
Oh, really? That came through?	Oh, really? Because I just got your text that said bone city.
When you care about something, the last thing you want is for it to be taken away.Whether it's a newfound hobby...	Oh, really? That came through?
...or the image of someone you looked up to.	Quick announcement, people. From this moment on, there will be no air-banding allowed in the hospital. The king has spoken. Thank you very much.
as for me, all I lost was my pride.	I would say she's probably going to die.
Sometimes she needs a little help.	Ha ha, you had sex last night with a beautiful girl that you really like!
Uh, you probably meant, "If it weren't for you, I'd still be dating my laptop."	Sometimes she needs a little help.
If you're referring to the game Find the Saltine, relax. I don't even play that with Turk any more.	Right. In your face, ha ha! Thank you. You know, I actually like Julie, so don't do that thing you always do.
Dating my laptop.	No, I am talking about how you go a million miles an hour the minute you fall for someone. Don't go too quickly, or just like I said, you'll just end up with another beautiful girl.
My friend, you have found the saltine! But don't tell Elliot we're still playing!	Behind your ear.
Why do I care what Elliot thinks? She's not right about everything. I mean, I'm not gonna go too fast with Julie.	My friend, you have found the saltine! But don't tell Elliot we're still playing!
No, it's a sound investment and a great addition to my portfolio.	Are we crazy to be thinking about buying this?
Which consists of two shares of Eastern Airlines stock and a pack of unopened Les Mis trading cards.	No, it's a sound investment and a great addition to my portfolio.
You're not broker of the year Whit Prowdy.	J.D., this is a mistake.
Why should I believe you?	Don't do this, you're going too fast.
I hate you, Whit Prowdy.	Because honesty is my business.
How did you know I'd move too fast with Julie?	Better.
I think it's important to listen to the people who know us best. Because if you do, you might get to rock......you might get the confidence to be the father you want to be...	What's happening? Dr. Cox didn't make eye holes.
Of course, sometimes it's fun to not listen and do whatever the hell you want.	Jack's gonna devour me now, see you later!
So, we bought it. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to kiss my lady on my new half-acre.	Of course, sometimes it's fun to not listen and do whatever the hell you want.
Unfortunately, the Clarks felt that if we weren't building a house, we weren't technically their neighbors.	Hey, look, the Clarks are home.
Hey, Clarks!	Unfortunately, the Clarks felt that if we weren't building a house, we weren't technically their neighbors.
OK! Hey, Buzz, I'm gonna beat you in poker next time!	Go to hell!
The Morgans on the other side were much friendlier. But I don't think we're gonna have them over again.	OK! Hey, Buzz, I'm gonna beat you in poker next time!
Hi.	The Morgans on the other side were much friendlier. But I don't think we're gonna have them over again.
Oooh, sweetie!	Wanna buy a baby?
I'm sorry, no thank you.	No.
Throwing in a crib.	I'll throw in a crib.
It didn't matter, because I was happy to look out at my beautiful half-acre with my sweet, but klutzy gal.	Throwing in a crib.
You OK, buttercup?	It didn't matter, because I was happy to look out at my beautiful half-acre with my sweet, but klutzy gal.
Turk and I had discovered a new way to deal with Kelso's bad moods.	The glass broke in my mouth.
It usually bought us a few minutes of peace. But then Carla said something that deeply disturbs every man on God's green earth.	Spoonful of peanut butter, sir?
I almost bought a baby yesterday.	I just got my period.This really sucks. I've been trying to get pregnant for two months now.
Don't tell them, in case you want it later!	What?
Nothing.	Don't tell them, in case you want it later!
What's Glass Man?	Yo, Glass Man!
You know who else is a great rebounder? Dr. Mickhead.His wife was killed on Saturday.	It's a basketball thing, I'm a great rebounder.
Hey, Mickhead!	Hey, guys.
He's still a person of interest.	The police cleared him yet?
There was sexual energy everywhere.For the women, it was because of the dashing new gynecologist, Dr. Matthews.	He's still a person of interest.
And for the men, there was a new, sexy Latina nurse: Nurse Martinez.	I got a lot of pap. Move your head so I can see.
Yep, there was eye candy for all. And only one thing could upset this delicate balance.	Would you guys stop doing that?
That's why they call him the glass man.	Wow. She looks like a young Carla.
Pull my hair! Whee!	Ohh, yeah! Don't stop!
OK, we can stop there. Um, now it's time to ring the sex gong.	Shut up and take it, you stupid bitch!
Uh, Turk and I got sex gongs in Chinatown. We're supposed to ring them whenever each one of us gets lucky. And even though I don't live with him anymore, I like to think that somewhere, somehow he hears it and it makes him happy.	What?
Hope my gong wasn't too loud for you this morning. I know it can be. It's a loud gong! I mean, it's like, gonnggg!	Yeah, buddy! Ha ha! That's my dog.
How could I forget my sexiest move?	J.D., I knew you were faking it because at the end you didn't say "bombs away."
Great, now Julie thinks I'm lame, and weird and pathetic.	How could I forget my sexiest move?
OK, from this moment on, I am officially out of my head.	J.D., she likes you. Just do yourself a favor and stay out of your head for once.
Don't listen to her, brown bear, your body is fierce!	And now his boyfriend will comfort him.
Like Taye Diggs'!	Is it?
Do I want her to meet Turk this soon? What if he doesn't like her?	So when am I gonna get to meet Julie?
I'm saying all my thoughts out loud so I don't mess this relationship up.	What are you doing?
I forgot, sometimes Turk is slow. You know what? It's time for her to meet the people in my life. I think she's gonna do great.	I don't understand.
You know what, let's just give that back. Thanks, nice to see you Mickhead.	OK, great, great.
Ha! We'll get you ladies some more coffee. Jordan, if you're willing to pay for it, just sit there frozen. How very generous.	...the slightly older still......and lastly, the very, very, very old. She is unconscious and virtually unwakable. Witness:Jordaroo! Jordalicious! Jordaroni! Uh-huh.
Yeah.	That's so funny!
Doesn't it bother you that she never laughs at anything?	Dude, Julie's awesome.
I mean when something's funny she never laughs. She just says "that's so funny." It's kind of annoying.	What do you mean?
Relax, Elliot. You're Mole Butt.	Me! Turk, she is talking about me. OK?
I gotta get cooking. People are going to be here for this barbeque any second.	If Jordan were conscious, she'd she'd agree. Aw, now who put that fake arrow through her head? Huh? Which one of you? It was me. I did it.
They're crazy about you. They're worried I'm gonna mess this whole thing up.	So your friends really like me?
The only jerk around here is the spicy marinade on this Jamaican chicken, mon.	Nah. You're not gonna be a jerk and do something like that, are you?
It is, Julie, it it is. Why do you always do that?	That's so funny.
Well you never laugh when something's funny. You just say "that's so funny."	Do what?
Who knows? Could be anything.You know what's interesting, Turk? She's not saying "that's so sad," she's actually crying.	Why is Julie behind that bush, crying?
Yes, I am.	You're an idiot.
She's right. I am disgusting. I am disgustingly incapable of carrying on a relationship with someone I actually like. I mean, I apologized to her, so I think we're cool for now, but it won't last. Every time she says "that's so funny" it's - it's like nails on a chalkboard to me.	You're disgusting.
You used to be the same way. Somehow you got over it and now you're married.	Well you're just too picky about women.
Oh, really? Remember Whitney the snapper?	That's because I was never as bad as you.
You OK, sweetness?	I made popcorn!
All right. Why are we watching a movie again?	I'll go make some more.
But how can you guarantee that she's going to laugh at this movie?	It's called immersion therapy. What we're about to watch is going to make her say "that's so funny" so many times that eventually it's not going to bother you anymore.
Make. Her. Stop.	That's so funny. That's so funny. Look how big that pancake is, that's so funny.
The immersion therapy didn't work.	Call me JJ.
Oooh. I like that.	Dude, relax. I was a Psych minor in college. The next time she says "that's so funny," I want you to pretend she says "that's so money."
Me too.	Sometimes I watch Roots to remind myself how good I have it.
I know.	All right, if you've found someone who makes you happy just sitting around holding hands, then eventually all that other stuff won't matter.Dude, not me.
Ha ha. One-a-day vitamins. I'll tell you how they could double their profits: Two-a-day vitamins.	Here goes nothing.
You know what? I really couldn't care less.	That's so funny! I'm sorry I said "that's so funny," I know that drives you crazy.
I don't know. I mean, we already got the half-acre, right? And I imagine we'll eventually be able to build a house on it, and a little backyard, room for a slip and slide for our kids, Gilligan and The Skipper. I know, I'm sorry, I gotta do it, I lost a bet to Turk. And I don't want to rush things, but I feel good about this. I don't know, I feel like you and I could go the distance.	So what do we do now?
Oh. Tapas.	Um, actually I meant what do you want to order from take-out for dinner?
Great for sharing.	I love tapas.
I love it. Just share and...	Sharing is fun.
So you really don't think about that kind of stuff?	Share.
You know what? We've just started dating, so I have a feeling this conversation goes down a really bad road. Why don't we just say we're never going to talk about it ever again, OK?	J.D., I'm only 23, and I don't even know if I want any of that stuff, and certainly not for the five or ten years.
OK.	OK.
OK. So you really feel that way?So here I am again. I can't believe I broke up with her. Why do I keep doing this?	OK. Whew.
It was August! The weather was far from frightful!	J.D., this was totally different. You didn't break up with her because she said "that's so funny," or because she was like Mini McSkinny and singing Christmas carols in the summertime.
I guess it's in our nature to think about the future. Especially if our dreams might not come true.	She's a keeper, J.D.! You'll never do better.
Yeah, buddy!	Get over here.
As for my future, I had finally gotten to the place where I was looking for the right person. And I knew she was out there. Even if I couldn't quite see her yet.	Yeah, buddy!
It's uncanny!	J.D., that's Gary Busey.
Now that we lived together, Elliot and I were getting tighter every day.	It's uncanny!
She wasn't great at practical jokes.But still, we'd become inseparable.	AAAAHHH!! OH!! OH, MY GOD, THAT'S COLD!! AAAHHH!!! J.D.!!!
Lay off Bob, OK? I'm still upset about this whole Julie thing...You know in high school once, there was a...Hope that hurt.	No problem. Newbie, quick, tell him a story.
Damn those roller blades. OK, everybody, let's gather round.	Hmm, Newbie. Looks like it's you. All the best.
After six months on the job, some interns can become completely overwhelmed.	Damn those roller blades. OK, everybody, let's gather round.
Where's Rex?	After six months on the job, some interns can become completely overwhelmed.
Put a blankie on him.	He's gone fetal again.
Unfortunately, young Keith had become competent so quickly that every word out of his chiseled mouth came tainted with an arrogant smugness that he couldn't hide no matter how hard he tried.	I've got it!
Right on cue.	Is there anything else I can do, Dr. Dorian?
No, Keith. All I need right now is a sip of your coffee to make me feel warm in my belly.Aww, Keith, look what you did!	Right on cue.
You think you're better than me? With your rock-hard abs, and your dynamite areolas? You're not.	Dr. Dorian, take my shirt.
Those, Jason, are the panicked scratches of the adolescent raccoon. Though until animal control can get into my home, it's currently residing in my sock drawer.I got this! Start it, Grandma!	Dr. D, what's on your back?
Ugh.	Hm?Mmhmm.Woohoo! That was close.
Keith, it's like you're begging me to hate you.	You OK, Dr. Dorian?
You can't stop, can you?	I don't feel like I am.
We were both a little edgy because our favorite patient, Mrs. Wilk, had developed a lung infection and needed to be intubated for a week. So basically, we had to put her in a coma. Of course, at her age, there's always a chance that she'll never wake up.	Newbie, today!
A whole week of sleep. You're gonna have some killer bed head. I'm nervous, I'm sorry, I love bed head, look, check this.	We were both a little edgy because our favorite patient, Mrs. Wilk, had developed a lung infection and needed to be intubated for a week. So basically, we had to put her in a coma. Of course, at her age, there's always a chance that she'll never wake up.
Even though you'd think we'd all be used to this kind of stuff by now, when a patient has been around for a while, it gets to everyone., no matter how long they've been here.	Go easy on him, he's my fellow. Now listen. If this doesn't work, I want you to just let me go. Don't let me linger.
All right. Here we go. See you in a couple days.	Changed my life.
Everyone has their own way of getting stuff off their minds.Some like to work it off.Others try to drink it away.For me, I had heard that the piercing girl at the mall was easy.	Let's hope so.
Thanks for penciling me in.	Everyone has their own way of getting stuff off their minds.Some like to work it off.Others try to drink it away.For me, I had heard that the piercing girl at the mall was easy.
Maybe later, you can show me where else you're pierced.	Mmhmm.
All right.Ahh! Uhhg! Ahh! Uggh!I feel so close to you right now.HOOOOO!!	Why wait till later?
I tell you, I am done trying to pick up the random ladies, because every time I do, I end up with a bunch of face holes and an emerald stud in my peep.	Yup.
Which I'm keeping.	I tell you, I am done trying to pick up the random ladies, because every time I do, I end up with a bunch of face holes and an emerald stud in my peep.
Oh, hey, you're up. Umm, look, I don't what you're looking for, but I just got out of a really tough relationship with this girl, Debbie. Also, my sister was carried off by a giant bird, so we've all been in mourning about that, and, um, my brother at my foot. But you were just fantastic. The things you were doing last night, they were, well, crazy. OK? Uh, so when I clear my own stuff up, I'd love to maybe get back together with you.	Cronk! Why you go now?
OK, I should really go.You know what? I'll do it. If my partner in crime here will join me.	Hungry.
What?	Well, watch this.
WAAH! Naked. Excellent. Who took my emerald?	So what now?
After paying the Janitor the unreasonable sum of $90 to move my bed back home......Elliot and I decided to round up out interns to pick out our respective booty calls.Welcome to Fugly-ville.	WAAH! Naked. Excellent. Who took my emerald?
Oh, I do love that show. It's like they've been watching our lives and then just put it on TV.	J.D., I really don't want to do this. Can't we just go home and put on our PJ's and watch Grey's Anatomy?
Hmm.	Ha! Yeah.
Carla listened at the door while I was helping Turk ask Dr. Kelso for new gym equipment.	Hmm.
And then, Turk lied.	What do you want?
Is there any change?	Sorry, baby. I tried.
I guess in the back of my mind, I was hoping for a pleasant surprise. Because around here, most of them are unpleasant. Like when a guy you thought you connected with, suddenly turns on you...	She's still the same.
...Or your boss blows your cover.	Well, you know, ladies, I do what I do, when I do what I do.
Of course, my surprise came the next morning when I found out that Elliot had broken our no booty call agreement with my nemesis	Woo. See, no, baby, wait. Aaah!
Why is he wearing my robe?	Of course, my surprise came the next morning when I found out that Elliot had broken our no booty call agreement with my nemesis
"El Toro Grande?" I'm not familiar with this brand.No change. Her FiO2 is still 50%.	I love booty calls. Ha!
I gotta tell you, I can't stand that guy.	I said no cream.I didn't say no cream. It's like having a sex puppy. What's your problem?
I'd appreciate it if you did.	J.D., he's just a booty call. Say the word and I'll end it.
I promised myself I would pick on Keith, but this one he had coming.	Anybody got a staplHey! Hey.
Oh, way to get to know your patients, there, murderer.	I've never even seen this guy before.
Doug, I left a note on the decapitated guy's stump that I would have him back by two. It is 1:45.	There's Mr. Joy. J.D., did you steal him from the morgue?
All right, the real reason I brought Mr. Joy up here was for a teaching exercise. Can anyone figure out what the cause of death may have been?	Now I have to take him back down to the basement and I don't even have my gurney. I hate dead people.
What did you say Keith?	Maybe when you leaned over to check his IV, you smothered him with one of your love handles.
Well, I'm not.	Dr. Reid told me that if you picked on me, I should stand up for myself. And that you're very sensitive about your doughy physique.
You know, Keith, I think out of professional decorum, we should refrain from talking about Dr. Reid. He's boinking her, everyone. That's why he gets special treatment. What did she say to do if I said that?	Please, no one help. He's not heavy at all.
Ack. I forgot how strong you are when you're mad.	Hello.
Doughy physique, Elliot? Doughy physique?	Well, you know what bothers me? You whining about me being in your space when you're the one who never wants to be alone. I mean for God's sake...
I am ashamed of you, OK, do you know petty it is to get that personal?Once, when we were dating, Elliot asked me to urinate on her.	Well, if the pear-shaped shirt fits, wear it!
Around here it can feel like good things never happen.	Dammit, I had been stung by a jellyfish!
I'll catch you up later.	did I miss anything?
Of course, when they do, all the petty little arguments fade away.And you don't mind waiting a little longer for your workout......Or your bar friend not being your work friend.Because the truth is, when you put stuff into perspective, the little things will never bother you again.	I'll catch you up later.
Did I say never?	Good morning, Dr. D. Dr. Reid told me to get my sweet ass out of the shower and make her an omelet. You want one?
Tender.In my defense, Keith's a decent kisser and anyone waking up that way would let out a pleasure moan.	I'm here, lover.
Really? What guy drunkenly kissed you while you were sleeping?	Same thing happened to me in college.
And it was at that moment that Turk and I remembered the incident we managed to block out for 12 years.	Really? What guy drunkenly kissed you while you were sleeping?
Totally.	Uh, you OK with us not hanging out for a couple of weeks?
I was going to miss Turk but luckily, my favorite intern was around to cheer me up: Jason Cabbagio. Or as I had brilliantly nicknamed him...	OK.
Cabbage!	I was going to miss Turk but luckily, my favorite intern was around to cheer me up: Jason Cabbagio. Or as I had brilliantly nicknamed him...
Oh, no Mark, I wasn't talking to you. I was talking to Cabbage.	Yes, sir?
I know that, but I've nicknamed you "Wolfman" because of your keen sense of smell.	Well, my last name is Cabbage.
And your ridiculously hairy torso.	I know that, but I've nicknamed you "Wolfman" because of your keen sense of smell.
Now, what can I do you for?	And your ridiculously hairy torso.
Well, yes and no, mostly no, really - really, all no. But don't worry, I got your back. First thing is, take a little nipper yourself.Oh, got some on you, look out! OK, that's some of the fun that you can have, but no , seriously watch and learn, watch and learn.	Dr. D, is the IV supposed to leak like this?
Take it all in, Cabbage, take it all in.	It's an honor to watch you work, sir.
Yes, I like some interns more than others, but I never let my personal feelings affect my professional behavior.	Take it all in, Cabbage, take it all in.
You're late, Keith! Which doesn't surprise me because you're a bad person.	Yes, I like some interns more than others, but I never let my personal feelings affect my professional behavior.
Lies will get you nowhere, Keith.	Sir, they needed help with a shooting victim downstairs.
That could be anyone's blood.	I'm covered in his blood.
That's not your blood.	Hey, look! My blood.
Quiet time.	Yes it is.
Not even Keith could bum me out because everyone's favorite patient, Mrs. Wilk, is going going home today.	Hey, I really clicked with "that guy in the restaurant," OK? We spent all night talking about...something, OK? Look, Turk, if I need you I can just call Carla. It's not like we hang out just the two of us anymore. I bet you don't have my number in your cell.
That was a huge courtesy laugh, because I was about to trump Carla's goodbye gift like nobody's business.	You should see the size of the stationery store.
Mrs. Wilk, I remembered how much you like basketball, so I got you a DVD of the NBA's "All Time Greatest Centers of All Time" signed by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.	That was a huge courtesy laugh, because I was about to trump Carla's goodbye gift like nobody's business.
Winner!	Oh, J.D., this is so sweet.
Oh, is it, Keith?	My gift is in the same vein.
OK. Back to the psych ward, Mr. Rosenberg. Crazy.	That's not my signature. Did you sign this? It's illegal.
Dr. Kelso was having his daily staring contest with the last double chocolate chocolate-chip muffin.	Anyone want a cool prison jumpsuit?
Keith, I realize you'd like to be at your grandmother's funeral on Saturday, heck, we all would. But you can't just take a day off whenever you feel like it.	I want that bird gone.
Because, Keith, Cabbage is an ape enthusiast. Show him a little.It's like I'm at the zoo. Put the thing in your mouth, when you...Yeah!	Then how come Cabbage got Saturday off so he could go see King Kong?
Hey, can I borrow five bucks? I left my wallet at home.	Oh-ho-ho, I can't believe you fell for that. Why would that call have been for you? It's my cell phone. Do you have my one button?Hey! Now I can't call my buddies in Saigon. Touché. What else can you do?
Thank you.	Thanks.
A bird took it.	Where's my change?
I'd sit with my interns, but Keith's over there and I can't stand him.	Why are you sitting here, Newbie?
What did you think of the Transylvania dream sequence? Because I wrote it while I was on call, and the next morning I woke up and read it and I was like "what was I thinking," you know?	I've seen that kid. Horrible doctor. I would sooner leave my medical care in the hands of Dr. Acula. Yes, I read your screenplay and as much as it pains me to say it, I didn't hate it. All right, lookit, here's what you gotta do with this Keith. You turn the heat up on his ass, and sooner or later he'll make a mistake and then you bounce him the hell out of here.
Well, I can't just pick one of them out to torture.	Bethany. Focus.
Actually, just this morning, one of them had trouble with an IV. Yesterday, one of them made a diagnosis off a backwards X-ray, and last week one of them make a patient septic when he confused a suppository with a Mike & Ike.	Then dump on all of them. I'm sure they deserve it, I mean let's face the facts. You are their teacher, how competent can they be?
When you get a chance, I'd love to talk to you more about the screenplay.	Stellar group there, Newbie, let the torturing commence.Oh, I'm sorry, that means conversational time is o-v-e-r. Please exit the area. Please exit the area. Please exit the area.
Turk and Elliot were having a hard time, too, because their patient, Mr. Burton, didn't make it through surgery.	Please exit the area. Please exit the area. Please exit the area.
Uh- oh, Keith. It looks like someone's gone prematurely gray. That's gonna hurt with the ladies.	Identical twins, Turk!
I think I know how to deal with people, Carla. Check this. Cabbage, heat test!	Wow. You know, Dr. Cox told me you were getting tough on your interns. I had no idea you were gonna go all cotton ball on their asses.
I'll add some milk. Thank you. See?	It's a little hot.
And now, it's goodbye, Keith.	Yeah.
Interns, gather! The next intern who screws up is going to be suspended for two weeks! This is a list of all of your names. At least the ones I remember. At the end of each day, I will either write a smiley face or a sad face next to your name. One sad face and you are gonzo, and I want to warn you, I write my sad faces pretty darn sad. Allow me to demonstrate. Dr. Cox, may I borrow your pen?	And now, it's goodbye, Keith.
Please? I'm in the middle of a very threatening speech.	Not going to happen. I had to strangle a nurse to get this clicky-top.
Thank you. So as I was saying, my sad faces...	Return this pen or die painfully.
Around here, it can be pretty tough to hang onto things. So if someone's trying to take your new friend away, you might have to lie.	Thank you. So as I was saying, my sad faces...
And if you feel your credibility slipping, you might have to excuse yourself for a moment.	Elliot, I gave it to you, you have the note, you give it to them.
Anyway, I know it's in pencil, but that's what a sad, two-week suspension face would look like, all right? Very, very sad. Yes?Who tried to give Mrs. Meadows an ACE inhibitor? She's six months pregnant, she could have lost the baby.	Excuse us for one minute, there, Devin, Eric, um. Hmm..
Of course, sometimes there's nothing you can do.	Anyway, I know it's in pencil, but that's what a sad, two-week suspension face would look like, all right? Very, very sad. Yes?Who tried to give Mrs. Meadows an ACE inhibitor? She's six months pregnant, she could have lost the baby.
Oh, Cabbage. Not you, Wolfman. Ugh.	That was me, sir. Sorry.
Nah, I'm just kind of sad about my intern.	You bested me again, you little chocolate bitch.
No, I drove Cabbage out. That's Keith.	Why? You got what you wanted, you drove Keith out of here.
Oh, I don't have it.	That's Keith? That kid's the best intern we've got. Hell, I'd like to bronze him and turn my office into a Keith-edral and convert to Keith-stianity. F.Y.I., I still want my pen back.
What's not over?Do you know what's not over?	You damn sure better find it, Newbie, and when you do, I want it buffed, shined and de-nerdified.You think that's funny? This isn't over.
You're gonna be an awful father!	Get over here, boy! You come over here and give your father a hug!NOOOOOO!!!!Dude, you all right? You were gone for a really long time.
And now, to take care of my boy.	You're gonna be an awful father!
Cabbage is back! Gang, I should have made it clear, earlier. The suspension policy begins today at 4PM. So, my apologies to Cabbage.	And now, to take care of my boy.
You get in there!	That's OK, Dr. D.
Let me explain something to you, Keith, OK? I treat each and every one of you like unique individuals, OK? Take Gloria, for example, she's 400 years old. She needs to sleep a lot. I work around that schedule.Wolfman has gotta be home by daybeak, so he does all of his work come nightfall. Crazy Barry. Not allowed near children. We work around that.	This is totally unfair! If I had messed up, I'd be gone.
Not everyone's last name lends itself to a nickname, Keith.	How come I don't get a nickname?
And what am I supposed to do with that? OK, I'm not a magician.	My last name is Dudemeister.
Those are beautiful antlers.	Hey, Newbie!Watch out for the bedpan. Now we're even. But answer me this one question, will you please?
You see, Dr. Cox, I treat each and every one of my interns differenly...	Ruh? Why is that screw-up still here?
that nickname will never stick. It's too long.	And, you're done. So, you accidentally drummed your friend out of here because you were trying to eighty-six the Dudemeister, eh?
I don't remember who made those mistakes.	Hey. Dr. D, is the IV supposed to leak like this?I'm not quite sure what I'm looking at here.Don't worry. You're going to feel much better after I insert this suppository.
OK, this sucks. But at least I didn't forge a note from a dead father.	Yeah, you do.
Time to give Keith, here, a little treat.	And, he's gone. Wow, that was impressive, my friend. You're free to fly.Farewell, Sanchez. Tienes mi corazón! Tienes mi corazón.
Hey, Todd. My buddy, Keith, here, says you're no good at rat-tailing.	Time to give Keith, here, a little treat.
Oh!	Oh, really?
Oh, he's good, Keith. Really good.	Yeah! There! Tell him I'm good!
Hey, Jason, uh, we need to talk. Look, you're you're not progressing as fast as the other interns, and you've been making a lot of mistakes lately.	Hey, Dr. Dorian.
Yeah, about coming back...	I know what you're going to say. I really am suspended for two weeks. But I promise, I'll do much better when I come back.
Dr. Cox was right. Things do happen for a reason.Like how going through a horrible experience with a friend can remind you how much you missed hanging out together.	Yeah, about coming back...
And in Cabbage's case, as much as I was gonna miss him, I was just lucky to get rid of him before he rally hurt someone.	What you doin'?
Frankly, the whole thing disgusted me.	Liar!
Mostly, because they never let me speak.	You saw him do it, didn't you, Paco?
He hid them in his pantalones. He loves these apples. He makes apples pie, and apples juice with them.	Mostly, because they never let me speak.
I hate the pickers' bunkhouse.	Paco, you can't talk because you lost your tongue in that cider press accident last year, remember? Now back to the pickers' bunkhouse!
And I hate Keith. Which begs the question: why do I insist on being a part of their foreplay?I guess I needed a distraction because last week we all thought Mrs. Wilk was going home, but she got an infection. Despite our best efforts, she was now going to die. To make her happy, we decided to take her to the beach.	I hate the pickers' bunkhouse.
Still, she was sick, so we couldn't go far.	I'm going to miss the feel of sand between my toes.
Want me to bury you?	Still, she was sick, so we couldn't go far.
I thought we had more sand.)	Aw, shut up and move the Sunbrella, will you? I'm freckling.
Sometimes life sucks.	Thanks! Cheers. You know, I've never really been afraid of death. I used it as a motivator. When you know there's an end, it forces you to live. It forced me in the eighth grade to ask Peter Bucharelli to take me to the sock hop. It made me dare to travel the world. It made me who I am. Still, now that I'm actually staring it in the eye, I why am I so scared?
Oh.	So, which one of you is gonna kick it? No, don't tell me, I want to guess. Uhh, I'm thinking it's either you, or you. No, you, because you're hooked up to a bunch of machines, or you, well you just have that look of someone who's gonna die young. I'm kidding!
We did not like him.	You're gonna live forever. Or not, I mean, what do I know, I'm not psychic.
Oh, oh, uh, OK, yeah, um...OK, death is like a journey. Uh, a journey in a boat, and uh, then this giant light shines down on, on your "boat," and um, um, it carries you up to the heavens.	All right, we will. Newbie, go.
Take it away, Coxy.	That was the ending to Cocoon.
I was tempted to take him up on it, but then Dr. Cox said something.	I understand you guys spend most of your time fighting death around here, so it's it's understandable that you're made uncomfortable by this. Now, if you'd like, I'm willing to counsel both of you.
"We?" He said "we." After all these years, he's finally made us a team!	Listen up. We don't need any of your head-shrinking.
Yeah, Hedrick! If it was up to us, we never even would have called you! We can handle death just fine! We might even be going into private practice together.	"We?" He said "we." After all these years, he's finally made us a team!
Easy. Now is not the time to discuss the Dorian-Cox clinic, Much less the relocation to Jacksonville.	What?
Keep moving, C-Bear.	'Sup, man, you need a ride?
I was hunting for bigger game.	Keep moving, C-Bear.
Oh, I tried to, Perry, but I'm having some scooter trouble.	Hey. I thought you went home already.
I was in the Porsche. I had never made it into the Porsche. It smelled like German heaven. I wasn't gonna blow this opportunity. I had to be careful about every little	Come on, I'll give you a ride. Let's go.Can you believe the huevos on that Hedrick? Holy cow, it's like we've never had a patient die on us before. Uh, I gotta put this bag in the trunk.
Hey, a root beer!	I was in the Porsche. I had never made it into the Porsche. It smelled like German heaven. I wasn't gonna blow this opportunity. I had to be careful about every little
Apparently you're not familiar with the John Dorian three tap method. Three taps and the foam goes bye-bye.Works every time.Oh. Ahhh! The quickest way to my house is to take Elm.	Don't open that soda. It's been rolling around on the floor for months, it will explode.
How you feeling Mrs. Wilk?	I see we're growling at other human beings now.
In a hospital, you spend most of your time just trying to hold on.Whether it's trying to hold on to your perception of a relationship...	She's been getting weaker.
...or just trying to hold on the handlebars of your custom bicycle.	You're his booty call now.
Unfortunately, as a doctor you see your fair share of people who simply can't hold on any longer.	Now we got leverage.
She's in multi-organ system dysfunction.	Unfortunately, as a doctor you see your fair share of people who simply can't hold on any longer.
I was not. But hopefully, the duct tape I used to connect my prosthetic arms was.	Phew. Pretty strong there, newbie.
Ow.	I was not. But hopefully, the duct tape I used to connect my prosthetic arms was.
She could totally turn it around!	Oh, why are we still doing this, I've seen people in Mrs. Wilk's shape turn it around, right?
Yeah, totally rally.	It's not denial. She could rally.
The good news is it looks like he has a soft face.	If he keeps ignoring my threats I I'm gonna have to hit him.
Coming to you, Mr. Johnson.	Are you done with my arms?
Dr. Cox and I decided to give Hedrick a piece of our mind. Unfortunately, I had lost front seat privileges.	I am?I am!
Yeah, you're right. Still a little sticky. Not yet ready for passengers.	Dr. Cox and I decided to give Hedrick a piece of our mind. Unfortunately, I had lost front seat privileges.
Yeah, is that what it is?	All right, Lester! We are having this out, right here, right now!Oh, for the love of God. What is this, some pansy, get-in-touch-with-my-feelings-because-my-mommy-didn't-love-me group?
Oh, we should probably go.	Actually, this is a support group for the terminally ill.
Dr. Cox.	Oh. Good.
That guy looks fantastic. What do you think he's dying of, a case of the handsomes?	Yeah, Newbie, what do you got?
Nor do you want to see I angry.You better hope you don't make any mistakes.It's awful.	YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE ME ANGRY!
Me too.	I tell you what. I'd do anything if it meant she'd pull through this.
We weren't the only ones at the bargaining stage.	Ehh.
We love it.	Don't ever get sick and tired of that, it is awesome being that.
It's too much, I know.	No!
And that was the moment it got real for Elliot.And for Dr. Cox and me.	Oh, Elliot! You like him!
We'd been there before when someone died. But this felt different.	Should be any minute now.
She's gone.	We'd been there before when someone died. But this felt different.
We were definitely in the depression stage. And bless Hedrick, he didn't say it. All he said was...	She's gone.
Letting go is never easy.Whether it's letting go of the leverage you had over your boss...	She was lucky to have you two as doctors.
...or letting go of your old booty call and making him your boyfriend.	I got seven Sunday's off a year. YAY!
But there's nothing more difficult than letting go of someone you cared about.	I'd love that.
She was.	She was a great old gal.
Don't worry. It's not that homoerotic, is it?	Oh, thanks for doing that, J.D., I do it myself, but the Bopsie twins are already loose.
Keith didn't know I mildly disliked him. He also didn't know I was rubbing Crisco on his back.	Oh, God, no.
That's the rhododendron, Keith, everybody knows they smell like pie when they bloom.	Does it smell like pie crust?
Thank you!	Hey, nice new watch, J.D.
It wasn't a watch. Now that Elliot had gotten serious with Keith, I needed to get tighter with Turk. And since he's so busy being married and trying to have a baby, I had only one option.	Thank you!
Come in, brown bear.	It wasn't a watch. Now that Elliot had gotten serious with Keith, I needed to get tighter with Turk. And since he's so busy being married and trying to have a baby, I had only one option.
I got us watchie-talkies	Come in, brown bear.
That's not my handle.	Hey, white shadow.
Right on. Hey, what are you doing, man? I'm about to take out the slip and slide. Let's do it.	Hey, Gizmo.
Awesome, check this.	Dude I can't.It's baby-making time. How's it going with Keith?
A local magazine named Dr. Cox the best doctor in the city. Dr. Cox felt this was big news.	Gotta go. Maintain radio silence on all channels.
Tell her I've known you longer.	I swear Turk, sometimes I think you and J.D. are more of a couple than we are.
People were starting to talk about Elliot and Keith. But I decided to stay above the fray. Then I changed my mind.	No judgment here, child.
Can you believe those two?	People were starting to talk about Elliot and Keith. But I decided to stay above the fray. Then I changed my mind.
It's just too much. Sorry, I switched places so I could go again.	It's way too much.
Yes, Rex?	Dr. Dorian?
Mrs. LeVinne has dementia, Rex, and I know she loves sweets. So take the pill, put it in some raspberry jam, put it on your finger, dip it in her mouth, helloo!	Uh, Mrs. LeVinne won't take her medication.
Rex would forever remember that morning as the time he lost his fingertip. But with patients, it's luck of the draw. you can't choose how tolerant they are.	Mrs. LeVinne has dementia, Rex, and I know she loves sweets. So take the pill, put it in some raspberry jam, put it on your finger, dip it in her mouth, helloo!
You can't choose how classy they are.	I'll try.
Uh, wow.	First of all, the only woman in this hospital that I would even consider sleeping with is is Jamie in pediatrics, mmmm.And, secondly, uh, I'm the attending. So tough tuckus.
It really is unfair, you guys!	So unfair.
No problem, brown bear. Are you nude right now?	Hey, Gizmo, can you check on Mr. Jensen for me?
Because your voice is always higher when you're nude.	Yeah! How did you know?
I'm gonna go hang out back here.	Aww uhh.
You firing blanks, buddy?	Oh, honey, stay calm. Nobody knows but us.
I was just glad to watch TV and for once, not be in a world of crap.	Ohhh....
Or not.	Why didn't you stand up for me?
Amen to that, C-Bear.	At least you're not sterile.
Fine, I'll just have an apple.	Morning!
How did you do that?I'm having a rough morning, Brown Bear, how you doing with your sterility?	Oh, looking for this?
Not reading you, Brown Bear! I repeat, are you still sterile?	Uhh, can't talk about that right now, I'm in an elevator.
Come in, Brown Bear, come in Brown Bear. If you're around, I'm having some java out front.	They're kielbasas.
Waah! I'm hit! I'm hit!	Huah!
Of course, buddy.	All right, look. I know I said I wanted to go by myself to get tested today, but I've been doing some thinking and I'm scared. So, it'd mean a lot if you went with me.
Well, you're in luck. This happens to be my specialty. Here's some tips. If you can't get over the fact that you're doing it to yourself, sit on your arm until it falls asleep, then pull it out and use that. I call it "The Stranger."	You know I'm not comfortable getting busy with myself.
I can't believe you're ready to have kids. We spend all day taking care of old people, washing them, cleaning them, why would you want to bring that home?	If I ever have kids you are never allowed to babysit.
All right, fellas, two quick announcements! First of all, whoever's been filling up my Tivo with JAG reruns, let's cut it out. Secondly, Harvey, no matter how drunk you get, I like to sleep alone.	J.D., we're talking about kids. Not going home to a house full of old folks.
That's your problem, buddy, I got my own thing.	But I like to snuggle.
Excuse me, are any of the reading materials in there available for those of us out here?	We're ready for you.
Dr. Kelso, do you really believe that? Or are you just saying that to look good? Ah, who am I kidding. You don't care what anybody thinks about you, do you? I gotta tell you though, you gave me some good advice about how to deal with Elliot. Gootchie, gootchie, gootchie goo!	I don't. She was married to my best friend, Richard. He died a few years back. You know the deal with friends. If they love them, you have to love them whether you like it or not.
You're right, Lisa, it is too late, because from now on, I'm going to be handing out all the case assignments. For instance, this cool case right here.Should I give it to the most annoying intern? Because that would be you, Lisa. Or maybe I should give it to the most incompetent intern missing a finger, because that would be you Rex. Or maybe I should just give it to the best intern, which would be you, Keith.Now if anyone wants to tell on me, to whomever they like, they can. Good day.Here you go.	It's too late, Dr. Reid.
All right, if you like him, I like him.	Thanks again, Dr. D.
Congratulations!	Hey! I'm not sterile!
My friends were all happy. And even though I felt like the fifth wheel, I could take solace in something.	Turk's not sterile!
Oh, hey, Turk. I forgot, I can't raid the freezer with you.Be careful in there, they lock it up at three.	My friends were all happy. And even though I felt like the fifth wheel, I could take solace in something.
I had finally won one.	Mmm? Oh. Oh-ho ho. I'm gonna kill him.
Keith was shockingly good at pretending to like crappy presents, but you know what he was best at?	Ooh. It's a mouth harp, awesome!
Keith, we need more popcorn. Yeah.	Keith was shockingly good at pretending to like crappy presents, but you know what he was best at?
Being girl bait.Here's how it goes down. Keith comes back. Elliot marks her territory so the girls know he's taken, and I just pick off one of the smaller, weaker ones that come by for a look-see.	Keith, we need more popcorn. Yeah.
I'm a doctor. I'm a land-owner. Burt Reynolds is my father. I love sports.Keith, more popcorn.	Being girl bait.Here's how it goes down. Keith comes back. Elliot marks her territory so the girls know he's taken, and I just pick off one of the smaller, weaker ones that come by for a look-see.
These old rags?	You have the cutest hair!
Why didn't you just read lines with the old guy?	What page are you on?
Sometimes you gotta go the extra mile with patients. That's what makes me such a special doctor.	My job is to make sick people better, not to help Bernie in there score a slice of Episcopalian tail on opening night.
Oooh.	That, and your amazing ability to switch back and forth seamlessly between male and female genitalia.
Personally, me, I believe that medicine is about more than just treating the disease. You gotta be there for people. Take Mrs. Cohen, right? When she broke her hip I treated that, but she had also left her car double-parked, so being an "extra mile" kinda guy, I went and took car of it.Sorry. It's been a little while since I drove stick.I wonder how she got out of that truck. That's how she broke her hip.	Newbie, snap out of it. I don't have time for your daydreaming.
I didn't. I just wanted to show you who I'm going out with tonight.	Why would you tell her that?
You can confide in me.	Look, Newbie, there's a reason I can't go the extra mile with patients. It's something personal.
It didn't bother me that Dr. Cox just "Kelly Rippa'd" me because I knew it would never catch on, no matter how much he wanted it to. This, however, did upset me.	I'm a *good* doctor. Kelly Rippa!
Uh, Carol, we got the bone marrow biopsy back and, uh, I'm afraid you have leukemia.	It didn't bother me that Dr. Cox just "Kelly Rippa'd" me because I knew it would never catch on, no matter how much he wanted it to. This, however, did upset me.
Yes, but the good news is it's very treatable. We just have to get started right away.	What?
Since there were only three attending spots for ten surgical residents, Dr. Kelso could basically treat them like his own personal valets.	Look, I'll track down a new one for you later, but right now I gotta make sure I have a job next year. OK?
Carla, can you cover my patients?	Mr. Sommers is a cousin of one of the trustees. Not important enough to warrant any face time with me, but connected enough that if one of those ding-dongs kills him, it will be my ass.
All right, I'll find somebody else.	She's already watching someone for me.
Carla knew that without their charts, doctors didn't know much about their patients.	J.D., why don't you tell me whats wrong with your patient, Mrs. Jones?Without looking at her chart?
Mr. Barry, I misplaced your chart, I forgot, what's wrong with you again?Oh, that's right, you have a kitty-cat stuck in your mouth.Or should I say you have a person stuck around you, little guy? Gootchie, gootchie.It's not like nurses know everything.	Carla knew that without their charts, doctors didn't know much about their patients.
Uh-oh. Carla's gearing up to explode. Save yourself. Attempt a casual side-switch.And you're there. Now angry at Kelso.	Mr. Barry, I misplaced your chart, I forgot, what's wrong with you again?Oh, that's right, you have a kitty-cat stuck in your mouth.Or should I say you have a person stuck around you, little guy? Gootchie, gootchie.It's not like nurses know everything.
Bob, how dare you?	Uh-oh. Carla's gearing up to explode. Save yourself. Attempt a casual side-switch.And you're there. Now angry at Kelso.
I hoped you learned something today.	Exactly, Flo, exactly.
All right, team, let's stay close. Come on. Carol! Look who I found!	Get a load of Mr. Extra-Mile-Guy's leukemia patient sitting there all by herself. Knowing him, he's probably out getting her a cake shaped like a cancerous white blood cell.
Well, right after I got your test results back, I got on the horn with your dad and we started a phone tree to find everyone. There were some tears, mostly mine, but we got it done.	Larry? Dad? How...?
Hear that, Perry? I'm the most amazing doctor because I went the extra 5280 feet. What's that? That's right, it's a mile. And how does that make me feel? Keith!Thank you.	You are the most amazing doctor.
Carol's family had welcomed me as one of their own. No more so than her brother, Larry.	No, no.What? Where'd he go?
EAGLE!	Carol's family had welcomed me as one of their own. No more so than her brother, Larry.
And I told you I never get dizzy!OK, let me tell you guys why we're here. Carol is starting a journey, OK? Obviously the chemo is gonna be tough, but we're all here for you. Anything you go through, we go through together.	I told you not to call me Lawrence.
Life in a hospital is constantly humbling. Whether it's making you realize you're not as skilled as you thought...	This is a preliminary ranking of your technical skills. So, whenever you get a chance.
...or as on the ball as you thought.	Fourth?! I'm fourth!
The key is to be ready for it.	Ow.
I was not ready for this.	The key is to be ready for it.
You can't let him know that you don't want to do this. Meet his gaze. Meet it twice as hard!	Are you ready to run the extra mile?
God bless his herpes.	Dr. Dorian, we need you. Mr. Bentley's condition is getting worse.
I'm going to go take care of that man and when I come back...	God bless his herpes.
Pause for effect. Pause for effect.	I'm going to go take care of that man and when I come back...
We're gonna shave this thing.	Pause for effect. Pause for effect.
I knew there had to be something wrong with her, she's too perfect!	Oh my God, I treated that girl at the free clinic. She was born without nipples.
I don't think it's funny.	I told you it would catch on.
I'm hiding. I really don't want to be bald. I have a sneaking suspicion it won't work for me. It think it might accentuate my spoon chest.	How's that leukemia patient of yours doing?
Plus, the girl I'm dating is totally into my hair.	Mm.
I'm sure there's something else she's into.	If it weren't for your hair, I don't think I'd be remotely interested in you.
There is, even if she won't admit it. You know what, I'm stuck, man. I have to shave this down.	No, there's nothing else.
That was a long time ago. Maybe you should listen to me for once.	No you don't. You don't have to go the extra mile. That's what I've been trying to tell you. What the hell happened to the days when you used to listen to me?
Thank you.	Not in this lifetime. Listen, Newbie, you're not a completely terrible, horrible, incompetent doctor and while I would never let any of my blood relatives be your patient, if it was someone that I knew, an acquaintance, I might be OK with you treating them.
Oh, Larry, man, I don't think I can shave my head.	Hey, where you been?
She'll be OK. She has all you guys.	What about Carol?
Whew.Whoa! Nana, how you doing? Looking hot in the track suit. Gym's on the second floor.	Yeah. I know you're not as weird as you want people to think you are.
Date time.	Whew.Whoa! Nana, how you doing? Looking hot in the track suit. Gym's on the second floor.
Oh no, that's Nana.	Dude! There you are. Two things, first, the aliens are here and they're wearing track suits.
Nice.	Oh. Second, I got a job.
Woo! Ah. Where were we?	And if you hadn't pushed me to do all of that extra mile stuff, that probably wouldn't have happened. So, thank you. You got a hottie waiting for you at the bar. You go get her.
That's one of my conditioners, yes.	Do I smell banana conditioner?
As great as this was, I couldn't stop thinking about what Turk said and howWhoa, this girl really digs hair. The point is, it's hard getting what happens at the hospital out of your head.	That's one of my conditioners, yes.
AAHHH!	As great as this was, I couldn't stop thinking about what Turk said and howWhoa, this girl really digs hair. The point is, it's hard getting what happens at the hospital out of your head.
I knew if I didn't leave that bar and go back, I'd never be able to enjoy any of the simple things. Even a woman eating my former bangs.	Not helping with the stress.
Voila!	I knew if I didn't leave that bar and go back, I'd never be able to enjoy any of the simple things. Even a woman eating my former bangs.
See, that's the thing about and extra mile guy. You never know who it's going to rub off on.	Voila!
How bad would she look with red highlights?	Hee hee hee hee!
All right, I'll count. Close a brother up.	I know. It is now my turn to hide.
I'm seeking you, Turk!	Is there a bigger idiot than you in the entire world?
Some things deserve to get tossed out on their asses.	If you would raise my allowance, I wouldn't have to bargain shop so I could buy pizza rolls. Secondly, this pregnancy test works just as well as the name-brand one!Wait a second. Results in three minutes.
But the thing you shouldn't toss out is a pregnancy test that takes two minutes longer than you thought.	OH! Oooh! Schoenen busen.
Every workplace has that guy who just has t top everyone's story.	Breaststroke five! Maybe later.
No. No more. Here are some of the lies you've told us over the last five years: You went to Harvard. You have a wife who only has a pointer and thumb-pinky. You have a a brother-dad, a mother-sister. You have two kids, no wait, you have one kid, no wait, you had a baby with a Chinese local, you're a deaf-mute, oh wait, now you're telling us that you're a world class hurdler and you slept with the beautiful and irreplaceable Amy Carter?	Good race.They offered me a full ride and Grambling, but then I slept with the President's daughter. Not the college president, the President of the United States. But, hey, if Amy Carter asks you out for a nightcap, you do not say no.
Ohh...	I I didn't sleep with Amy Carter. We did everything but.
We're not buying it, are we gang?	And I really was a world-class hurdler.
The people have spoken. Allow me to bask in the glow.	No, nah, heck no...
Not now, Turk, I'm glow-basking.	Oh-ho! J.D., guess what?
You tell him. Aw, just wait a mi OK, you tell him.	She just went downstairs. What is all the excitement?
Why don't I tell	What's going on?
Uh, Carla, preggo!	OK, you go
Wait, Turk! When has a man ever been able to tell his wife that she's pregnant? Allow me to paint you a picture with my imagination brush, OK? You two come out in the parking lot where all Carla's friends have gathered. They're holding a giant banner that says "Carla, you're pregnant, and I dove you." Did I say "dove?" I did, Turk. That's when I cue the bird-wrangler who releases 500 white doves into the air. Where do they land? I don't know. But one thing Carla knows is that in her uterus is a little, soft, baby Turk.	I haven't told her yet. I'm gonna go tell her now.
This won't be indoors, Turk, and there certainly won't be all those people throwing bird seed. Why were people throwing seed? It's a the point is that you, my friend, have a chance to be on the greatest surprise a husband has ever pulled for his wife. And you get credit for it the length of your entire marriage.	Are you forgetting what happened when you made me have doves at my parents' anniversary party?
Great, I'll tell everybody. You find Carla. Dr. Cox	I'm in!
Can you just please not tell Carla?	Ever since I was blitzkrieg'd this morning by an enraged German named Otto, a certain Dr. Barbie no longer exists for me. So, if she was to ask me a question, I wouldn't be able to hear it, and you'd have to repeat it.
And Elliot, if you see Carla, don't get emotional.	Fine.
Really? Baby.	Oh, no problem.
OK. Oooh, look at this one, he's so cute!	We just got a lot of great new grandfathers in.
I already have a grandma.If I get one this little, everyone's gonna think I'm gay.Aw, look at this fellow. Come here boy, I got a little hard candy for you.Yes, you're a good boy. You got a candy you can unwrap in a movie theater!I'd name him Sebastian.	He's not good with people.He's great, but we don't want to separate them.
Yeah, I pissed him off earlier today. How am I supposed to avoid him?	Hey, what's up with the Janitor? He seems a little more lurky than usual.
It would take a very clever plan to hide this tiny, penny-like sensor on him.	You should put the hide and seek sensor on him. That way you'll always know where he is.
Mr friend, we have just Lo-Jacked the Janitor. Hello.	We pulled it off. See if it works.
All right everybody, before Carla arrives I want to thank you all for turning out, especially you, Father Rosenberg. Incidentally, when all this is over, I'd love to get the back story on that name of yours, OK?Excuse me.OK, coming through. OK, now apparently they don't have fetus balloons. Who knew? So what I've done is attach string to the belly buttons of these baby balloons to signify the umbilical cord. OK, make sure everybody gets one.	Oh no.
Oh no. We got a glitch. Abort the plan! Abort the surprise! Abort the babies!EVERYBODY RUN!Sorry about the whole "abort the babies" thing.	Me too. Just need to send a quick text.
I may have gotten over-excited and told one or two of her family members that she's pregnant.	Sorry.What are you doing?
I felt like Turk was starting to blame me for all of this.	Turk, I think the answering machine is broken. And I don't think we have any more wine. Can I have some of yours?
Spilled mine, too.	I spilled mine, too, honey. You know what you should do? Ask for some of J.D.'s.
What are you going to do?	I'm going to bed.
Wait, Turk! I have an idea.	I'm gonna go tell her the truth and hope that she's so tired from being pregnant that she doesn't have the strength to kick my ass for more than a few hours.
It's a good 'un.	You have another idea, huh? I gotta tell you, I'm done with your ideas. And not just for now, but forever. OK, are we clear on that?
OK, we need Carla to find out she's pregnant on her own and we need your help. Can we count on you?	I'm listening.
If we go down, we're taking you with us.	Who's pregnant?
Really? Because I think you're both very close to Carla, aren't you? And yet you chose not to tell her she was pregnant. Turk how would that go down for them?	You can't blackmail us.
Unpleasantly.	Unpleasantly.
And I'd enjoy it.	On my life.
OK, listen up. Everyone in the hospital knows Carla's pregnant, but they don't know that she doesn't know. We need her to find out on her own before anyone congratulates her, OK? Here's the plan. The three of us are going to run interference. Dr. Cox, Dr. Kelso, I need you to get her to take another pregnancy test. This plan is foolproof.	Thank you.
You go left.	Heh, we'll see about that.
Actually, I need to come with you.	OK. That was right.
Uh, she went up to the roof to get some air.	Where's Carla?
Follow her. Lock her up there.	Oh.
Hello, Janitor, waiting around the corner to grab me.	You got it.
I'm holding a GPS warning device that goes off whenever you come within a hundred meters of me. It's responding to a tiny sensor in your stomach.	How'd you know that was me?
You'll never get anywhere near me.	I knew that wasn't a penny.
Yeah, we will see.	We'll see.
The only thing left to do? See.	Oh, we're gonna see.
We'll see.	You're going to pay.
OK, bye.	No time.
I don't know, I'll have someone from the psych ward check her out.	What's she yelling about?
I was a little anxious because it was tie to change Mr. Beeper's batteries. All clear to the left, all clear to the right. You can do this.	Hey. Dr. Dorian, I got those batteries you asked for.
As I lay there, watching Nurse Roberts hammer-throw 23 pounds of high end fruit my way, I could take solace in one thing.	He's 100 meters away, and it's going to take him at least ten seconds to change those batteries. That's not even a world record pace. Ready, set, go.Time!Still got it.
Any second now, Carla and Turk were coming to tell me they were pregnant. Carla had to believe that I was truly surprised.I was the lynch pin of our plan. Showtime.	We're having a baby!!
What's the scoop? I would have no clue what it could be.	Hey, J.D. We have such big news!
Oh!	We're having a baby!
Now give them the ten minute emotional roller coaster ride that is the speech you've been practicing all afternoon.	Oh!
Carla, when Turk first told me, I	Now give them the ten minute emotional roller coaster ride that is the speech you've been practicing all afternoon.
Oh boy.	What do you mean "when Turk first told you?"
What would you have thought of doves?	Uh...We've known for a day. That pregnancy test you took yesterday was positive. Yeah, I wanted to have everybody at the hospital gather outside and surprise you with balloons and stuff.
Then I witnessed one of those moments that let me know in my heart that these two would be together forever.	So everybody already knows?
Yeah, we are.	Who cares? We're having a baby. We're having a baby!
Oh, no no, I know I've got the hair, but I'm not one of you people...Hello, how are you? Well, I have been known to tambour.	Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna/ Krishna Krishna Hare Hare...
After our tambourine jam they gave me some literature, but I'm not the type that's easily sucked in by that stuff.	Hare Krishna Hare Krishna...
Praise be to Krishna! Dammit.Hey, Mr. Coleman, how are you feeling?	Good morning, Dr. Dorian.
Um, Mr. Coleman, the hepatitis is doing a number on your liver. You're obviously very jaundiced...yellow! Oh, mellow yellow, I get it, that's funny! You know, I never knew what that song was about. Now I now I finally get it. Liver disease. Anyway, we're going to give you suppressive therapy and do everything we can to make sure you don't need a liver transplant, OK?	They call me mellow yellow.
All right, see you, Mr. Coleman.	OK.
Unfortunately, a month later...	All right, see you, Mr. Coleman.
Frank, we have no more options. We gotta get you a new liver.	Let's hear it.
All right, buddy. Today's the day.	Something horrible just happened.
The amazing thing about livers is that a healthy person can actually have part of it removed and give it to somebody else. For Frank, that person was his brother, Marc.	All right, buddy. Today's the day.
Marc was a stand-up comic on a cruise ship.	Hey, somebody order a liver? Ha ha ha! Uh oh. Jello? Jello? Is this thing on?
He was a genius.	If I'm not careful, they'll put me in the pun-itentiary.
I didn't either. Hey, Turk, if you ever donated a body part to me, you know which one I'd want?Hey, thanks for the butt, playa!	I didn't get that one.
I do, Carla. I'm building something.	You better have a reason for taking my man's badonka-donk donk.
A brick house!	What?
I do.	Tell Todd he can kiss my big, black ass. Bet you wish you could say that.
You know, you could be a dynamite center square.	How does he come up with this stuff?
You mean we are off. I changed my schedule which means I have Thursday nights off which means we are going out which means you are going to be my wingman. Even though you're horrible at it.	Dude, four more hours and I am off.
Turk, are you sure this isn't offensive? It doesn't look like anybody else is wearing a costume.	When have I been a bad wingman?
All right.	Buddy, relax. These are my guys, all right? As long as you're with me, they're going to find this funny.
Wazzup!Waaaah!!	That looks like Talia.
Wooo! Ahh!	My bad, my bad.
Every time I saw them they yelled out "cracker." How did they know I love crackers?	That that wasn't Talia.
Good luck fellas.	Wish us luck guys!
We'll be rooting for you.	All the best.
And I will see you later.	Good luck.
I am so mad at Lorelei I can't even talk right now.	Did you see it?
It's great. You surround yourself with some new friends. You say one clever thing and you're in. Watch this. You guys, let's tally it up, gather round! Whoa, Carol! 180, amazing! Lisa, you had a 125. Turk, 192!	I can't believe people hang out at bowling alleys now.
And bowled a gentleman's 40. Now, who wants to help me off with my shoes? I forgot to wear socks.I'm losing them.	That's how we do!
Nice save.Krishnas.	If you ladies remain in this area, we'll bring back drinks.
Wazzup?	Good to see you again.
Look at you, man, you're color's back, there's no sign of infection.	Oh.For the next twenty minutes, you will sit in silence while I tell you why the Detroit Red Wings are the greatest franchise in the history of professional sports. On September 25, 1926...
You look great, man, I'm glad.	I feel I feel great.
Unfortunately, things weren't going as well for Marc.	Thanks.
Sometimes that's the way life works. The ones who do the nice things suffer the most. Whether it's giving up Turk Night for a friend...	He's hypertensive and tachycardic.
...Or going out with an intern to make your wife happy...	Just get them done.
...or agreeing to be the bad guy for your boss.	Oh my God.
When you're the one paying the price it can really make you wonder...	Hi!Oh, come on!
He's bleeding out. Prep the OR. CAN I HAVE THE CRASH CART IN HERE!!	When you're the one paying the price it can really make you wonder...
...was it worth it?	He's bleeding out. Prep the OR. CAN I HAVE THE CRASH CART IN HERE!!
No, man, we're all cool now. They even invited me to this alumni thing they're having in January.	Dude, you got bowled by my frat brothers.
Sounds hot. Hey, we're going out Thursday, right? Because I went online and got a magic eight-ball bowling ball. Check this: Are the ladies going to love this? "Ask again later?" Oh, I'm just kidding, it says yes.	The Martin Luther King Fling?
You're going. Where are the interns?	You know what? Thursday night might not work for me.
What?!	They're with Dr. Cox. Apparently he's mentoring them and talking to them and stuff.
Oh. My. God.	I might have an answer for that: Ew. I mean come on, children, what do you actually think is going to happen here? Do you think I'm going to take you and sit you down next to me and say, uh, "listen, um, if you need anything......you've got my pager. Just know that I'm there for you, always."
No! Zip it! I am so G-darn pissed right now. I was OK when you kept me at an arm's length because everybody said "that's just Cox. That's how he operates." And I believed them. Now I walk in on this. This bi-racial love fest? You know what? I hate to do it, but I'm giving you back the pencil. That's right. The pencil you gave me on my third day of work. You handed it off to me like a like a tiny yellow baton. Like you were trying to say to me "J.D., you are the new me. You, J.D., are my mentee. You are my son."	Newbie...
Oh, that's perfect.That's perfect. You know what, take it!Maybe you can use it with Rex, or Gloria, or that guy.	What pencil?
Heh. His name is Leslie. His name is Leslie. You're name is Leslie. All right, good for you, Leslie.LESLIE!	That guy's name is Leslie.
How dare you!	Jordan, you promised this would never happen.
I can't right now, I gotta go check on Frank.	J.D. Can I talk to you?
Hey, Turk, you wanted to talk to me?	Oh, I didn't tell Frank. Look at him. He's so happy. If he knew what I went through, he'd feel terrible. Why would I want to do that to him when I love him so much?
I'm having a great time, man.	Uh, reggaeton.
Cheers.	Me too.
Hey little guy. Doug's still pretty upset about the whole thing.	Plagh!
Carla being pregnant had changed everyone. It made Dr. Kelso softer.	Diseased rodent should be nowhere near my pregnant princess.
Carla's pregnancy also affected Elliot.	Ahh, I think the children in pediatrics would love this little fella. Ha ha!
As for me, I bought a custom-made Italian suit.	Keith, we're doing this. I need it.
Eh? What do you think? I had it made for the christening. That little mixed-race embryo got a godfather yet?	As for me, I bought a custom-made Italian suit.
Thanks for your opinion, Carla. But I'm much more interested in what you all think.	You know what, I'm not sure that suit works on you.
Well, who cares, Lonnie. Because all that really matters is whether or not America loves it.	We don't love it.
He's a dynamite tailor. Not sure why he's here.	For the last time, it's Americo. And of course I love it. I made it!
How you doing, buddy?	You better put your scrubs on, Herbert's back.
Because of his weight, Herbert was a frequent visitor and no one liked treating him.He wasn't a mean thing. See, with big people, even the simple stuff is more difficult. I didn't mind, because Herbie was my man.	How you doing, buddy?
How you feeling, love bug?	Because of his weight, Herbert was a frequent visitor and no one liked treating him.He wasn't a mean thing. See, with big people, even the simple stuff is more difficult. I didn't mind, because Herbie was my man.
Herbie, it's not a bath house.We'll get those bandages off later today, Mr. Brooks, all right	Fully loaded. Hey, it's time for my sponge bath, right? I need three girls...
And just like that, I had the chance to comfort Claire.	You turned me down fourteen times for drinks. Well, who's the creepy loser now, huh?
You look like you need to be rescued.	And just like that, I had the chance to comfort Claire.
Life was good, but then came a surprise visit from my brother, and a round of the game he likes to call "Watch her leave."	You look like you need to be rescued.
Yes, she was, Dan. Thank you. We'll be right back.	There's no easy way to say this. We've got the crabs.Oh, she was cute.
Well, you know, Mom does what she has to do.	I had to blow out of town. Mom doinked her new boyfriend and then goaded him into getting me a job interview where he works. Yuhh.
Don't call him Coxsmith.	That does not count as a formal hello, Coxsmith.
Well, OK.	I call him Coxsmith.
And they weren't. They were taking it all in stride.	Nah...
What's up my negro amigo?	Oh, and if you mention the names to anyone, they'll ruin them for us, so don't tell anyone, OK? No one.
Hey, I paged you because I can't figure out what's going on with Herbert. He's got acute back pain and no cauda equina signs.	Nothing.
Oh, you know what, I'll be done in a couple of seconds. We'll find her.	Oh, she's at home.
Thanks a lot, dude.	Dan train. Woo woo!
That Dan train used to hook up with Elliot.	What?
Doctor-patient confidentiality goes both ways, Mr. I-Prefer-My-Temperature-Taken-Through-the-Back-Door.	So? Man, your boy J.D.'s been telling him that Elliot still likes him.
Look, Dan doesn't exactly have the world by the tail, OK? Every time he calls me all depressed, the only thing I can think of to cheer him up was to say "Elliot still digs you." I'm just trying to find a way to make him feel good about himself, you know?	What? I mean it tickles.
What about Tiger?	If we have a boy, we're gonna name him George.
Oh boy.Call Elliot...call Elliot...No. N Call Elliot...got her...	Hey, man, where'd your brother go, anyway?
Now that Dan knew that Elliot wasn't in to him, my focus had shifted from keeping him away from her, to avoiding him so he doesn't kill me.	It's so funny the way kids are, isn't it? Ha ha ha! You never know how it's going to go.
Hey, Mr. Brooks, let's get these bandages off you.What are you doing here?	Now that Dan knew that Elliot wasn't in to him, my focus had shifted from keeping him away from her, to avoiding him so he doesn't kill me.
As long as you're not my brother.	Mr. Brooks wanted some safety tips on how to safely operate propane heaters.
Yeah.	I had a brother once. Well, I shouldn't say once, he's still my brother. My parents adopted him when I was about 12. He was about 46. Actually older than my parents. His name was Cleat. And he talked like this. Howsitgoin? Howsitgoin? Good kid. Did what they said. Make the bed, mop the floor, sweep the lawn, whatever had to be done. Everything was good till he was in his fifties, and then, wow, did he have a midlife crisis. Him and my dad fought constantly. And I mean, really, physically beating on each other. But I don't blame him for it though. I blame my mom for sleeping with him. That's just out of line.
Watch what?	Anyway, the reason I'm telling you this is because your brother told me that if I could keep you focused on me, he would let me watch.
WAAAAHHH!!	Hey, little brother.
I guess I could help you name her. Let's see. It's a girl hamster, what about Angie?	Ah-ah... Where did you come up with that name?
Me too. Angie, guys?	I love it!
Angie it is.	Yeah!
Wait, Turk, it was an accident, OK? The name just popped into my head!	Hold his arms!
No! Turk!	Shut up!! You just shut up right now! Pink belly.
Unfortunately, Turk was the greatest pink-bellyer in all the land.	No! Turk!
So, Herbert, how you doing with your diet, man?	Why the hell not?
Uh, Turk was so proud of his handiwork that he signed it.I think he knows it's so painful I won't be able to wash it for some time.	The best I could do, man. How's your tummy?
Actually, we were. Because the way the whole brother thing works, now that Dan had beaten me up, it was all over.	Hey, man, y'all two OK?
Or not.	WHY DID YOU LIE TO ME ABOUT ELLIOT?!
Oh, come on, man, a girl like Elliot could never be into somebody like you.	Or not.
The obvious response was that Elliot was looking for a guy with more going on in his life. And the only way to gently break that to my brother was this:	Why wouldn't she be into me?
Elliot wants to have kids right now, and she knows you're not ready.	The obvious response was that Elliot was looking for a guy with more going on in his life. And the only way to gently break that to my brother was this:
Elliot! Elliot!	Herbert, I'm afraid your back pain might involve your spinal cord, so we need to get you an MRI. Now where is my pen?
My brother is on his way up. You have to tell him that the only reason you don't want to be with him is because he doesn't want kids right now.	'Sup, J.D.?
Elliot, the last time I was honest with Dan about his life it just made him feel like crap. And he didn't talk to me again until our dad died. Do you really want me to do that? Because I'm not sure what would get us back together this time. Dad can't die again.	J.D., just tell him the truth.
All right, man. Say hi to Mom for me.	I got a good feeling about those two. Well, I'm off.
And like that, he was gone.	Yup. Get my stuff.
OK, guys, let's all gather round, huddle up. Now, you guys, Herbert in there needs an MRI, but he won't fit into our machine. Does anybody know what we should do?	Yeah. I gotta vomit first.
Nobody wanted to say it, but sometimes when hospitals have Herbert-sized patients they'll send them to the one place that has MRI machines big enough: the zoo.	OK, guys, let's all gather round, huddle up. Now, you guys, Herbert in there needs an MRI, but he won't fit into our machine. Does anybody know what we should do?
I know what you're all thinking, but I'm not going to do that to Herbert, it's too humiliating.	Nobody wanted to say it, but sometimes when hospitals have Herbert-sized patients they'll send them to the one place that has MRI machines big enough: the zoo.
Why do you hate Herbert?	Damn.
Spare me the tough love speech, all right? You really think that going in there and being mean to Herbert is going to cause him to turn his life around and lose 100 pounds?	He's been in here seven times, all for weight related problems. I mean, he's never even tried to get healthier. Sometimes protecting someone's feelings isn't the best way to go.
Hey, Dan?	Yeah, I thought he was gonna learn how to tie knots.
I do, but I want to talk to you about something.	Hey, Johnnie. Just packing up. Thought you had to work?
Elliot doesn't want to have babies with Keith.	Yeah, what's up?
When I said Elliot would never be into a guy like you, it's because you're a 35 year-old bartender who still lives in our mother's attic and is showing no signs of changing. I'm not saying this to make you feel bad, Dan, I'm telling you this because I think you have the potential to do whatever you want to do with your life. But you have to actually try.	Huh. Tough break for Keith. You know, I almost had a threesome with that guy.
And then I got the answer I expected.	When I said Elliot would never be into a guy like you, it's because you're a 35 year-old bartender who still lives in our mother's attic and is showing no signs of changing. I'm not saying this to make you feel bad, Dan, I'm telling you this because I think you have the potential to do whatever you want to do with your life. But you have to actually try.
Even though I knew my brother wasn't going to change, Elliot was right. It comes down to what helps you sleep at night.	Don't you have to get back to work?
Whether it's a sense of denial......or the fact that you love your son.As for me, I was just happy to get some rest.	Who are we kidding? This is so real now, there's no way we can sleep!
Hey.	Whether it's a sense of denial......or the fact that you love your son.As for me, I was just happy to get some rest.
You know what, man, you might as well just keep it.	Hey, Johnnie, is it cool if I borrow this suit? I figured I might wear it to that job interview.
I think you can do whatever you want to do.	Yeah, I'll keep it. Hey, uh, you think anyone would ever really hire me?
No, he wouldn't.	That's Optimus Prime, and I don't think he'd appreciate you calling him the big, ugly one.
Not Optimus.	No, he wouldn't.
Turk gets defensive when it comes to his mother.	What do you mean "did?" J.D., last Christmas I walked in on Turk and his mom cuddling in bed.
Whoa! We should probably take a break.	I think you're just jealous because your mom's dead.
I can't get this crib together. And would somebody please bring me a glass of water?	But, baby, it's too soon to be putting a nursery together, or test driving minivans, or buying baby monitors.
Thank you.	You go this time.
Thinking about Turk and Carla becoming parents made me think about my own mom, and how much she probably misses me. I bet she wishes she could see what life is like around here through my eyes.And that's why I strapped my video camera on top of my head.	Thank you.
Lonnie.	Morning, weirdo.
It was the perfect idea. She got to meet my superiors.	Lonnie.
I even got some great footage of Dr. Cox.	Sorry, the old man stole some ice cream.
I'm making a video postcard. Do you have a message for my mom?	Where the hell have you been?
She had a hysterectomy last month. I'm sure I can just edit over that part.	No, but since she brought you into this world, I have a message for her uterus.Bad uterus! Don't do that anymore.
Mr. McNair had locked-in syndrome. A paralysis so severe that he could only communicate through a computer that responds to his eye movements.	Let's go see Mr. McNair.
Oh, thank you for asking, Mr. MacNair. You see, the thing about Dr. Cox is the closer he feels to a person, the more he means to push them away. So when he calls me Ava, he's actually saying "J.D., I care about you." Vulnerable people, like...	Why does he call you a girl's name?
Now you're being a jerk...jerk...jerk...jerk! JERK!	Oh my God. I get it now. Carol...Carol...Carol...Carol...Carol...
What?	Newbie!
My bad.I felt bad for Mr. McNair, but I was off until six tonight, so I decided to grab a quick nap in the sun.What the...whoa!	I'm relatively certain the computer is broken.
Where am I? Hello? Anyone?	Have you seen J.D.?
WAAAHHH!	Uh, 6:00.
Cold.	How was your day?
Even though the Janitor had basically kidnapped me, when he helped me up, I couldn't help but feel there was hope for our relationship yet. I guess being locked up all day really make you appreciate the things that really matter...	Now help him up so he thinks there's hope for our relationship yet.
OK, moving on. It was time for my new daily ritual: asking Dr. Cox to lunch.	Waiting for my moment.
Hey, Dr. Cox, what are you doing for lunch?	OK, moving on. It was time for my new daily ritual: asking Dr. Cox to lunch.
Oh, good luck eating. This is every spoon from the cafeteria. And guess what? Today just happens to be soup and frozen yogurt day.	Not having it with you, Paula.
Because it's ludicrous.	Lunch for us, not going to happen. Normally, I'd tell you something harsh right about now, like "we're not friends," but then you'll just grin that stupid grin and shake your head back and forth, like "how could that possibly be true?"
You called my bluff, and today isn't soup and frozen yogurt day, it's actually salad and smoothie day.	Ah, just give me a spoon, will you please?Oh, for goodness sake.
I think I may vomit.	I got a hot Italian sausage for you right here! People think I just luck into these situations, but it's really a lot of hard work. You know what else is hard? I should go.
Some doctors like to change into their streets when they go out for lunch. Not me. I like how the world reacts to me as a doctor. Whether it's a friendly greeting from the world's slowest bagger...	I think I may vomit.
Lookin' good pal, eggs on top, OK? Eggs on top.	Hey there, Dr. Dorian.
...Or a smile from the manager of the herbal section.	Lookin' good pal, eggs on top, OK? Eggs on top.
Hey, Rebecca, you got that echinacea for me? Just kidding, you know I think all this stuff is voodoo. Good to see you. Hey, looks like somebody else is sick of that cafeteria stuff, huh?	...Or a smile from the manager of the herbal section.
A friend dropped me off.EAGLE!Hey, wanna go splitsies on some deli counter meatloaf? I can't finish a whole serving. I mean I can, but I don't like to. It all goes right here.	Aw, now what the hell, do you follow me here?
Yes, it could be more of a nightmare. Jill Tracy was a former patient who had once tried to kill herself. Sad, yes, but this did not change the fact that she was unbelievably annoying.	Guys!
Oh, we have to get back to the hospital.	Oh my God, what are you doing here? I was supposed to meet a guy for a date. I know what you're thinking, a Tuesday lunch date at the supermarket? He is so not into her. Well guess what? He's not!I waited for an hour just thinking "how many more guys from my yoga class can reject me before just saying enough,"
One of those emergencies, I should probably go, too. How are things?	You know what, Newbie, stay. Have lunch.
Oh, come on, Rebecca, everybody's doing it.I won't tell anyone if you don't.	You know that's stealing.
Security?	Security!
I don't think there's a security force at...OK, hey fellas.	We've got a grazer.
Where's the shaving cream, is that aisle two, still?	Ha ha! Wherever you're taking him, take me, too! Nah, you go ahead.
Most doctors stressed with so many people clinging to life. Dr. Cox vibed on it.	We've been over this before. You win on account of your father's not dead yet.
I do feel like a sandwich.	Sorry, go step up Davey's dialysis to take your mind off of it.Newbie, you feel like a sandwich?
I had one objective: Pick up everyone's lunch at the grocery store and get out of dodge.	You feel more like a pastry, a very doughy pastry. I don't feel good about that. Way too easy.
Whoa!	I had one objective: Pick up everyone's lunch at the grocery store and get out of dodge.
Hey, Jill.	J.D.!
Mmm.	How weird is it that we're both here two days in a row?
It's not not sad.	I was thinking there might be a 50% chance that the guy who blew me off yesterday just got his days wrong and would be waiting here with roses. Is that sad?
That's an awesome story, Jill.	Plus I have the whole day free. My shrink couldn't make our appointment. He found his third wife in bed with his second wife and got so depressed that he downed an entire bottle of his bulimic daughter's Prozac. So now he's back in the hospital.
Ah, what the hell. I can live with one kidney.	Yeah, this will do.
Stay away from my organs!	Because we'll probably just go ahead and sell this one.
Having lunch. The cafeteria stinks and I can't go to the grocery store because apparently crazy Jill Tracy lives there. Every time I try and shop she follows me around, like I'm her only friend in the world. It's pathetic.	Dude, what the hell are you doing?
I'll come, too.	I'm gonna go talk to Carla.
Oh, yeah, Dale, this is totally going to bring out your pecs. Plus, I'm using olive oil so I can lick it off later. Make 'em dance!Oh, they're dancing! Somebody's making them dance! Whooo-wee!Tell them it never happened!	I'll tell you when I first suspected he was gay. It was very subtly, but...
Sure, what's going on?	Dr. Dorian? Can you help me?
She had been, uh, stood up on a couple dates. And, uh, she hadn't seen her shrink in a while. She was definitely depressed.	She was admitted a short time ago and she hasn't regained consciousness. Tox screen's positive for cocaine.Do you think she could have OD'd?
She told me.	How do you know all that?
In hospitals, there are certain rules.With surgeons, if the overcompensating, pumped-up, shaved-down doctor seems gay...	She told me.
...He's probably gay.And if there's good news for one doctor...	No, why?Oh, he's glistening.
...It probably means bad news for another.	People, I've got our organs.
Thank you.	You can use her organs.
No.	Just tell me this: Is there anything anyone could have done?
Unless you mean me.	No.
Any idiot could have seen that Jill was in trouble. I'm supposed to be a doctor, and I'm the reason she's dead.	And why are you not giddy with praise, like those other people? Don't you know I dole out compliments at most once a year? And like a squirrel, you must gather these acorns of kind words to sustain you for the upcoming cold, sarcastic months.
Then he said the words I never expected to hear.	Any idiot could have seen that Jill was in trouble. I'm supposed to be a doctor, and I'm the reason she's dead.
Vintage Cox.	Yes, I can, but I'm not sure just how much we'll get done. I tell you what. We'll go over here and brainstorm while we wolf down these sandwiches. Newbie, come.
You know what I was thinking the whole time I was havig lunch with Jill?	Vintage Cox.
God, this girl's annoying.	What's that?
Why?	I saw her in that supermarket, too, but I'm not torturing myself. Would you like to know why?
OK, I hear you.	Because she didn't come to the hospital looking for help. We just randomly bumped into her out here in the world. I mean, don't get me wrong, if a guy gets shot, or if he has a heart attack and I am physically the closest doctor to him, I will intervene. But shy of that, you can't. I mean, you just can't. It's too much to ask of yourself.
And because he said that, I knew it wouldn't.	No, you don't. Once you start blaming yourself for deaths that aren't your fault, my friend, that's a slippery slope that you can't come back from. And trust me, I've seen it ruin a hell of a lot of good doctors and I will not let it happen to you.
And just like that, whatever burden of responsibility I felt was lifted. But like I said before, good news for one person can mean bad news for another.	Perry, the autopsy just came in on your donor, Jill Tracy. She didn't die of an overdose.
We did everything we could over the next few days to keep the transplant patients going, but odds were against us.First we lost Mrs. Sikes......And then Mr. Dennison.And I knew that Dr. Cox needed me the exact same way I needed him earlier.	I'm the Todd.
Hey. Hungry?	We did everything we could over the next few days to keep the transplant patients going, but odds were against us.First we lost Mrs. Sikes......And then Mr. Dennison.And I knew that Dr. Cox needed me the exact same way I needed him earlier.
I guess that lunch was kind of a one-time thing, huh?There's no way you could have seen that coming. I mean, rabies? Come on, there's, like, three reported cases a year. In fact testing for it would have been irresponsible. You would have wasted time those people didn't have.	No.
You had to be. The fact is, those people were going to die in a number of hours and you had to make a call. I would have made the same call.	I was obsessed with getting those organs.
Yes. Now I got us lunch. And I think we should eat it.Right then I knew I was going to pull him out of this. But unfortunately, sometimes the hospital picks a day where it's just going to pile it on.	Yeah?
Where are you going? Your shift's not over. Hey! Remember what you told me? The second you start blaming yourself for people's deaths...there's no coming back.	Oh, God. Come on.Clear!Still in V-tach, clear!Come on. VF, Clear!Aw, come on. Come on, Come on! GOD! GOD, GOD!He wasn't about to die, was he, Newbie? Could have waited another month for a kidney.
...Or nobody remembering Ray Catay's eightieth birthday.	Right after I put some drops in.
Uh, I would have, Mr. Catay, but Dr. Reid is throwing a huge celebration for you later.	Why aren't you guys making a bigger fuss?
I should tell her about that. The truth is, with modern medicine, 80 isn't that big a deal anymore. It's not like the olden days.	Uh, I would have, Mr. Catay, but Dr. Reid is throwing a huge celebration for you later.
Let us not feel sorrow for Bobby Adams. He was 12. He lead a full life. He will be missed, especially by his beautiful wife, Jenny, who stood by him even when he turned 6 and had a midlife crisis and was caught banging one of those naked people who brought us corn.I'd be the oldest man in pilgrim village.	I should tell her about that. The truth is, with modern medicine, 80 isn't that big a deal anymore. It's not like the olden days.
Still, you should always celebrate life, because you never know when it's going to throw you a curve ball. Like with Dr. Cox. He recently made a decision any doctor would have made and because of it, three patients died. At first, he was inconsolably sad.After that, he started acting out.	Let us not feel sorrow for Bobby Adams. He was 12. He lead a full life. He will be missed, especially by his beautiful wife, Jenny, who stood by him even when he turned 6 and had a midlife crisis and was caught banging one of those naked people who brought us corn.I'd be the oldest man in pilgrim village.
Yeah, enough, gang. That's how rumors get started. Hell, Gloria, I made a joke once that you hooked up with Leonard, the big, black security guard with the hook hand. Now everyone thinks it's true.	Yeah, and I heard that he bitch-slapped the maitre-d'.
OK. Well, make sure to put antiseptic on any puncture wounds, OK? Now, I know Dr. Cox seems crazy mad at the world right now, but let's remember. Three patients died. What's amazing is that he can take a hit like that, one that would knock the rest of us out for good, and come out the other side still standing. That's why the man's an inspiration. I mean, he is a rock.	Gloria! I love me some white meat.
Yup, he's the best damn doctor here.	OK. Well, make sure to put antiseptic on any puncture wounds, OK? Now, I know Dr. Cox seems crazy mad at the world right now, but let's remember. Three patients died. What's amazing is that he can take a hit like that, one that would knock the rest of us out for good, and come out the other side still standing. That's why the man's an inspiration. I mean, he is a rock.
Oh, no.	Newbie, will you give me a little trouble? I'm having some help here.
Pregnancy had made Carla a little hormonal.	Families that aren't from Connecticut, Elliot.
I couldn't believe how depressed he was yesterday.	Beat him, got it.
You don't even know what we're talking about.	Oh, I know. When I first heard about it was like "whoa, no way!"
Pass.	You fellows want to go to a real donkey show? It's really very tastefully done. I understand one of the women who entertains the donkey used to be on a soap.
Always pass, sir.	Well, standing invitation, every Thursday.
Turk, you know what bothers me? Dr. Cox shows up to work drunk and we're all acting like nothing happened.	Well, uh, I'll ask Mickhead.
Turk was psyched because orthopedic surgeons are notoriously the most unemotional, jockish surgeons of all.He was finally going to have a boss he could connect with.	I don't know, I kind of feel for the guy. Besides, I am way too excited. I start my orthopedic rotation today. It is going to be awesome.
That's pretty lame.	He actually said "I think that's pretty special." Then he got all emotional. How lame is that?
Well, you hug me all the time.	I'm just not into all of that sensitive, touchy-feely stuff.
You're sports team's in the World Series!	Yeah!
A grand slam!	Ha! What a game!
OK, let it out. I got you. J.D.'s got you. Hold me tighter. Little too tight. There's a good spot.	Great. Is there another guy on this planet who's that sensitive?
You gonna go talk to Dr. Stone?	It doesn't look cancerous. Eh, get in there and take your pants off.
Turk was right. Personal feelings shouldn't get in the way of a professional relationship. But they do.	Nah, it'll blow over. Plus, he's a surgeon, and surgeons don't hold grudges. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go scrub up. And by the way, your shift with Dr. Cox starts in ten minutes.
Look, Carla, I have a real problem with what Dr. Cox did and I don't think I can go over there.	Actually, Dr. Turk, I think I'm going to let Dr. Norman here take the lead on this one, OK?
You'd be surprised. There's something called Munchausen Syndrome, where a parent will intentionally harm their child to get some attention on themselves.	Who would smother their own child?
Hmm, someone should.	I've never heard of that. Someone should do a public service announcement about it.
You had a tough day at the office, so you come home, make yourself some dinner, smother your kids, pop in a movie, maybe have a drink. It's fun right? Wrong. Don't smother your kids.That problem would be gone forever.	Hmm, someone should.
I'm just not down with the whole drinking and doctoring thing, OK? Excuse me.	...sunshine all over the place, just put on a happy face! Yeah!
I can help you with Dr. Stone. He's one of my people. He's a sensy.	I'm never gonna get a good surgery on this rotation.
It's short for sensitive guy. Our music is acoustic alternative. We marvel at fireflies. And when we help a drunk girl home from the bar, sure we cop a feel. A feel of her hair as we're pulling it back so she doesn't get any vomit in it.	What's a sensy?
I did! That was our last year! I didn't what you to get Jagermeister in your corn rows.	I'm having a weird med-school flashback. I think you held my hair back while I vomited.
Hockey?	My Latrell Sprewell phase.
Dammit.	Basketball.
You're gonna cry in front of him.Laugh if you must, but it'll show him you have emotional depth and it will trigger a nurturing impulse inside him that we sensies can't resist.	What am I gonna do about Dr. Stone.
Anywho, don't worry about crying. I got this menthol from the pharmacy. I read online that actors in Hollyweird actors spray it in their eyes when they need to fake cry.	You need to cry, let's brainstorm. I could hit you over the head with a wrench. Or, I could stab you in the gut with a knife.Knife-wrench! Practical and safe.Waah! OH! Ohh! Oh boy. Ahh!
Oh, I'm using it for the final death scene in my movie, Dr. Acula. Last night, my German financier, Hans, rest in peace, died on the Autobahn. So now I gotta shoot the whole thing on my cell phone.	Why do you have five of them?
OK, there he is. You ready?OW! He's the one who needs to cry, you idiot, not me!AAAHHH!!	She made me watch.
No!	Oh, yeah, I forgot all about that crying stuff. I was just...Oh, hey, loose thread.
OK, he's hugging Colonel Doctor, which means you got about seven seconds.	Got it. Knife-wrench! For kids.
A good one does. Here's the plan. What you're gonna do is tell him a story that isn't inherently sad. That way, when you get all emotional, he's gonna think you're extra sensitive. At which point, I'm gonna nail you with the menthol and you'll be crying like a ten year old pilgrim widow. Here he comes. And, blacktion.	A hug takes seven seconds?
And, come on, fishy, take the bait.	Yeah, you know, I'm just out here thinking about my wife. She's pregnant with our first child.
He's not a sensy. He's a nutjob.	We are not so different, you and I.
Good. That gives us time to come up with a new plan.	Old habit.So, he has a mild concussion, and they're going to let him rest for awhile.
He's your attending, you have to connect with him. You need somebody you can look up to. Someone you can count on. What you need is someone who will always have your back.	Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. That's it. I'm done. There's no way he and I are going to have a relationship. Not unless I want to bear his seventeenth child.
Right then I knew what I had to do.	No, J.D., that's what you need. That's what you've always needed. Maybe after five years of working here, that's not such a good thing anymore. I gotta go and do my shift with Dr. Cox.
Hey.	Right then I knew what I had to do.
You're probably wondering why I didn't show up before, huh? I know you wanted me to, even though you'd never admit it. Normally I would kill to get into this apartment. And you try and keep me out. I say try, because at your Superbowl party, which I was not invited to, I was lucky enough to be able to watch the second half from right over there. I was the bearded Domino's employee you invited in because I said I was a fan of Jerome Bettis, who ever the hell that is. Anyway, I tried to convince myself the reason I didn't come earlier was because of you coming into work drunk. But that's not it. I was scared. I guess after all this time, I still think of you as like this superhero that will help me out of any situation I'm in. I needed that. But, that's my problem, you know? And I'll deal with that. I guess I came over here to tell you how proud of you I am. Not because you did the best you could for those patients. But because after 20 years of being a doctor, when things go badly, you still take it this hard. And I gotta tell you, man, I mean, that's the kind of doctor I want to be.	What's up.
Maybe he just needed time to heal, or maybe he just needed to see how much everybody cared but I like to think that it was because of me that he was finally able to say this.

Ohhh, that's awful.	You don't drink scotch.
That's the thing about family. When you fall off the deep end, you can always count on them to rally around you. When you come back, you might get a quick hug, a pat on the shoulder......Maybe just a nod.But no words really need to be spoken. Of course, it's always nice when they are.	Glad you finally shaved.
Welcome.	J.D....Thank you.
Hmm, Turk talking to a new staff member. Give her a treat and say hello.	Oof! When will you learn?
Hello!	Hmm, Turk talking to a new staff member. Give her a treat and say hello.
Uh, no, you big knucklehead, I don't. On behalf of everyone here at Sacred Heart, I'd like to say konnichiwa.	J.D., I'm sure you know Kim Briggs.
I know that, Kim. It's a game we play. What's your name? It's Turk. What's that guy's name? I don't know, he's a patient. Looks like a Dave. Are you a Dave? Maybe he's a Dave, we don't know. Hey!	I've been here five years, big guy.
How come I've never noticed her before?	Will do. Peace out!
] Everybody was Kung-fu fighting! Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah!So you're saying because she wears a wedding ring she's invisible to me?	Kim was here on your first day.She was at Ben's funeral.She's been around.
Please, T, I'm not that shallow.	Yes.
Dr. Feinburg? Anastasia? Gift Shop Girl?	Oh, really? Will all the women in the room who are married, please remove your wedding rings?
I thought you died.	Hey, J.D.
But I sent your family flowers.	Nope. I just got married.
Gift Shop Girl!	I know. You bought them from me. It was kind of weird.
Sorry.	What?Stop that!
All the guys liked her.	I had checked up on Kim. She got along with everybody.
All the women liked her.	Thanks, Todd.
She even got along with the greasers.	I just love that every woman knows how to do that.
I never got a synchronized snap from the greasers.	Guys, I know everyone gives you a hard time, but trust me. This look is coming back.
WHAT?!	Mr. Peters, I know that having a gal urologist might seem a little uncomfortable, but the penis is just another excretory organ, so let's go ahead and take the stigma off it. Now this is the length of the average penis.
You know what? I'm not talking to any of you guys.You lieOh, my God.	Good for you! I was just messing with Dr. Dorian over there.
Where do you perform?	Hey, Dorian, let me borrow that pencil for a second. Just one second? Thank you.Oh no. I snap-a da pencil. What do you think? It's for my stand-up act.
Well, I'll have to come by sometime.	I'm at the Giggle Pit. Every Monday at sunup.
No, wait a second, I'm mad at you! You stole my video camera with all the scenes on it from Dr. Acula, the vampire movie I'm making.	Do it, man.
I don't know, maybe I was surfing the hospital's website and I saw that someone posted the "Dr. Acula delivers a baby, then eats it" scene? Someone with the screen name "Rotinaj?" Rotinaj is just Janitor spelled backwards, Rotinaj.	Why do you think I stole it?
Hm.	This is goodbye for us, but I'm leaving you in the very capable hands of Dr. John D. Dorian. You take care.I gave you a new middle initial. It reassures me for some reason. In my mind, the D stands for Dallas because I just got finished telling Mr. Peters that's where I lost my virginity. Don't know how we got down that path, it's something about that old man that just makes me want to open up.
I don't mind it a turtle's wink.	Anyway, I hope you don't mind your new middle initial.
Wait, you only pepper your conversations with cute animal imagery if you're smitten.	I don't mind it a turtle's wink.
Quick as a porcupine's hiccup.	Could you lend me your pen?
All right, there's only one problem with this.	Quick as a porcupine's hiccup.
Kim, wait. Unfortunately there's no way I can make you mine. Unless I make you mine...for eternity!	OK. See you J.D.
Vampires like it windy.	Dr. Acula, don't....stop!
Don't let him in your house, sir. He'll steal everything you got, like he stole my video camera.	I'll do it. I shouldn't be mopping in here anyway. This is a rug.
Your melon-size prostate, sir?	Do you know the difference between me and you, Dorian?
Relax, brown bear, there's no shame in cry-maxing.	Baby!
Wait, Kim's single?	And you know how hard single life can be. Just ask Kim.
Turk! Keys!Yahtzee!Hey, girl. What are you doing? Wanna get some coffee later?	Oh, yeah. She's been divorced for like, over a year. She just wears her ring at the hospital so she doesn't get hit on all the time.
And then, the ultimate Cox block.	Turk! Keys!Yahtzee!Hey, girl. What are you doing? Wanna get some coffee later?
Yeah, she thought it would be best if I treated him medically.	I decided against it.
I guess we all get mad when people say things we don't want to hear.	I'ma kill somebody.
Especially when things feel a bit fishy.	Oh, my God, Carla. Will you please just butt out of this one?
Still, it's always good to hear the truth.	Mmm, I don't think it's any business of yours.
Even if it meant losing respect for someone you thought you might like.	Surgery is really the only thing that has a shot at curing this guy and the reason that she's not going to do it is because he's older and he's got heart issues which makes him high-risk and if he were to drop dead on her operating table, well, that would make her surgery stats go down. And that wouldn't look very good on a young doctor's resume, would it?
Damn.	What can I say? You got me.
Oh, here comes Kim. She's had all night to think about what she did, so she'll probably be in a shame spiral. Let's enjoy it.	Stupid greasers.
I wasn't the only one having relationship problems.	Large! What!What, was I not supposed to answer?
Mmm, that was nice.	All I think is that leather never goes out of style. And if you're gonna keep your money in a pickle jar, you should probably know how much is in there. And that it never hurts to buy your invalid wife something nice, so maybe she can feel pretty. And these are general thoughts about life. Nothing specific to you.
Don't "Hey, dudes" us, you know what bothers me?	Hey, dudes.
It bothers me that a doctor wouldn't help a patient so she could keep her stats up.	Non-threatening, colloquial greetings?
Well, my best friend here is a surgeon and he would never pass on a risky surgery just to keep his stats up.	Look, J.D., surgery is competitive. We do what we have to to get ahead.
Oh, my God. Out of here!Dr. Cox, please weigh in.	Actually, I have done that. Everyone has.
Now back to the crux of the matter! Hit her, Per!	Well, it's no secret how I feel about surgeons. I hate them. I would liken them to rocks, but that would be an insult to rocks, because you see, at least rocks are useful to society. We build bridges with them. We throw them at guys who wear those tiny phones clipped to their heads. It's a phone. You can't do this? However...
RRRGH!	Thank God he didn't see this.Yeah, Mom, I was listening the whole time, I just couldn't talk.
I think I need to take more...bloooood!	Really?
Because it's my movie! Now let's take it from the top and I'm not gonna ask you again. Blacker.	You ain't takin' no more blood from my ho-slappin' hand. I will pimp slap you. This feels a little racist, J.D. Why can't I be a vampire?
Yes, please.	Blacker.
Nobody really speaks to Carla like that.	Whoa, whoa, OK, that's enough! I don't know what you two are fighting about, but it doesn't matter. Because no one is allowed to be that mean to my girlfriend, especially when all she's trying to do is apologize! Are we clear?
The irony was that Keith was yelling at the one woman who was trying to save his relationship.	It was really cool getting to know you, man.
And even more ironic was that it looked like she had.	I'm sorry, Elliot.
I think Elliot finally seeing who Keith really was made me understand why I was so upset with Kim.	Yeah, totally.
Yeah, well, it's just...	Look who's happy again.
I finally figured out what bothers me so much about you.	J.D., one second, uh, I'm on the phone with my Mom.She just got her RV fixed. Mom, I gotta go. You can call me from the road.My mom loves the road.
It's the way you're so concerned about protecting yourself. I mean, no one in this entire hospital has a bad thing to say about you, and I'm guessing that's because you're so careful not to rub anyone the wrong way. And you still wear your wedding ring. That prevents any guy from getting anywhere near you. You wouldn't operate on Mr. Peters, and we both know you're protecting yourself there. I don't know, I guess in the grand scheme of things, it's not that big a deal. I just I was a little disappointed to find out how you turned out to be. I'll see you around, Kim.	Well, lay it on me, studly.
Who is Dr. Briggs operating on?	Please don't tell her.
I saw you did that surgery on Mr. Peters. Did you decide it was the right thing to do?	And good luck. I love that movie.
Then why did you do it?	No, actually it was a stupid career risk.
Oh. Cool.	Because for some reason, I find myself really caring about what you think of me.
Wow, Gloria, do you kiss your great, great, great, great, great grandkids with that mouth? Zoom, zoom, zoom! Ted, that's funny! Where's the chuckle?	And I need you to suck it.
Where's your mom?	Bank foreclosed on my house.
Dr. Kelso celebrated spring by wearing his golf shorts to flaunt his oddly youthful legs.	She's out in the car with the cats.
Yup, love was definitely in the air.	Uh-uh, no kissing! Hands behind your back! Let's go!
Hey, Kim, how would you like a night on the town with the hottest doctor in this place?	Yup, love was definitely in the air.
You zoom, zoom, zoom?	I'd rather just go out with you. Ohh! Zoom, zoom, zoom!
Oh, cool.	Ha! Of course. I invented the zoom, zoom, zoom.
Liar.	Oh, cool.
Help the poor kid out.	So, Josh, you are suffering from a condition called phimosis. It's basically a hardening of your foreskin. As part of your treatment, I'm going to ask that you masturbate five times a week.
Well, five times a week, huh? For me that would be cutting back.	Help the poor kid out.
He said, in front of his future girlfriend.	Well, five times a week, huh? For me that would be cutting back.
You know what? I should probably mosey.Looking forward to our date.	He said, in front of his future girlfriend.
That's mine.	See you around six, wear something slutty. Zoom, zoom, zoom.
Hey, Tubby.	I know, and I'm loving it.
Ooh.OWWWW!!	Oh, J.D., come here, I want to you to feel something, quick!
Pregnant witch. Hey, there's Kim. She and Elliot had bonded over their ability to communicate at the speed of light.You'd have to slow it down for humans to understand.	Don't call me Tubby.
We are not going the mall, Elliot. I was gonna make you dinner and then go to karaoke, but I'm not sure how to do both in the same night. Unless, of course...	Ah, yes. The best thing about having a date with J.D. is that if you're having Chinese food and you decide you want Mexican, you can just walk right on to the other side of the food court.
Too late, I'm already there.	J.D., not Floating Head Doctor.
Body could stay home and prepare the feast.And as always, Head could take care of entertainment.	Too late, I'm already there.
I couldn't if I tried.	Don't go breaking my heart.
Oh, honey, if I get restless...	I couldn't if I tried.
Body, come!Stupid Body! I gotta do everything myself!Oooh, oooh, and nobody knows...Come with me, Come with me...	Stop hogging the mic!
Head loves karaoke.	Body, come!Stupid Body! I gotta do everything myself!Oooh, oooh, and nobody knows...Come with me, Come with me...
Well, trust me, Kim. I've beaten up many nerds in my day. But tonight's about you having the best first date ever.	Well, I'm up for anything. I married my high school boyfriend, so the only first date I ever went on was in tenth grade. I began with me sitting in the backseat of his Miata, because his friend, Benny, called shotgun. And it ends with us going to the arcade, and I quote, to eat pizza and beat up nerds. And I married that guy!
Bye!	All right, slugger!
You had to soil the whole food court thing. It's veal piccata night at Sbarro's!	You don't have anything planned, do you?
I have to get ready, man. I want my date with Kim to be perfect. What do you think about a romantic horseback ride on the beach?	Uhhhh...AHH! Believe that, missy!
Yeah, yeah, but except this time with two horses.	Ooh, like you and I did for your birthday.
Unfortunately, I can't. My deck has sort of become a cruise-in spot for older, gay gentlemen.Get off my deck, you old queens! Go! HEY! Whose is this?!Whose is this? You find somewhere else to hang out! I know for a fact Les Mis is in town!I tried turning my hose on them, but they liked it.	Why not just take her to your deck? You can just lie out, look at the stars?
I didn't need luck because this was going to be the most romantic date ever.	Well, if anything, good luck, buddy,
Your steed, m'lady.	I didn't need luck because this was going to be the most romantic date ever.
Upsy-daisy.	J.D.! I've never ridden a horse on the beach before!
No problemo.	Wow, no saddles. Are you sure you're going to be OK riding bareback?
What's so hard about riding bareback?	No problemo.
Oh, yeah, it was awesome.	Oh, that was amazing! Wasn't that so much fun?
Oh, no, no, no. The date continues.	OK, I called an ambulance, but you should really let me examine you.
Looks like my plan is working.	J.D., I'm a urologist and there's a good chance you have testicular torsion. In which case, you could lose a testicle. So, come on. Off with the pants.
Actually, that's a preexisting condition.	All right, testicular function is normal. OK, one is significantly larger than the other.
Yes. Wait, your right or stage right?	So the right one's always been bigger?
Retract it.	Ugh, let me test the retraction.
OK, the date's not going as planned, but you can still save it with your legendary gift for small talk.	Retract it.
So, you're from Texas, huh? They say that's the Lone Star State. What exactly does that mean?	OK, the date's not going as planned, but you can still save it with your legendary gift for small talk.
Oh, Kim, I'm sorry. I wanted to something fun for our first date.	J.D., I hope you're not beating yourself up about this.
And there it was. The moment where pity was turning into genuine affection. Classic Dorian.	No, it was so much more fun than you might think. I mean the first seven or eight minutes rocked! Admittedly, it was a little more like work after that, but at least I got to third base with you.
I feel like we kinda missed first base.	And there it was. The moment where pity was turning into genuine affection. Classic Dorian.
Well, maybe we should fix that.	Me too.
And then it happened. Elliot Reid: Moment Killer.	We should.
What? I had a coupon.	Really?
I wasn't the only one to have an uninvited guest.	What? I had a coupon.
Are you responsible for this?	Well, that's true. That's pretty much why we work well together.
Sorry.	What are you talking about? I'm selling my old mop. The 2007's are in.
I'm afraid, mocha bear.	All right. There she is. We spent all morning crafting a line so raw with confidence, that if you pull it off you're back in the game.
Hey, Kim.	I know. Buck up.
Well, uh, the swelling's gone down... for now.	Oh, hey, J.D., how are you feeling?
Go out with me again tonight.	You're an idiot! Ha ha ha!
With who?	Oh, J.D., I would love to, but I'm going to a Neil Diamond concert.
Elliot Reid: Moment Killer.	With who?
This is my first scooter rally. Do you want to be Paunch or John?	Well, you know what J.D.'s got planned since it's his day off and he's dateless?
Oh, hey, Mom. No, I'm just hanging out alone tonight. I just didn't really have anything else to do.	I can totally picture J.D., too.
Ugh, I hate cleaning up after those messy, old queens.Ooh, appletini. When did they start drinking straight-guy drinks? Mmm. It's fresh.	Hmm.
Hey, Kim. What happened to Neil Diamond?	What's up, chicken butt?
Thank you.	I haven't seen Keith in a while, so I'm gonna take him instead. Kim's letting me off the hook.
What's up?	You're welcome.
It seems like good friends always come through for you.	Nothing.
So what do you want to do tonight?	Why does your TV smell like doodoo?
OK. I'm cool with that.	Why don't we just hang here and look at the stars until we're comfortable to make out a little?
OK, you let me know.	Not yet.
And like that, I felt like all was right with the couples in the world.	OK, you let me know.
And right then, I knew this was the start of something important.	OK, now.
What now?	I'm pregnant.
As for me, I spent my free time getting coworkers I just met pregnant.	Yeah, well, you're not as big a trend-setter as you think you are. Right, Keith?Ohh.
You're pregnant? Are you sure?	As for me, I spent my free time getting coworkers I just met pregnant.
Uh, Kim, I'm not really sure how to phrase this, so I'm just gonna dive right in: Have there been other penises?	I'm pretty sure.
Cool.	It's yours, J.D.
Aaaaauuuuugggggghhhhhh!!!!!!	Are you okay?
Yeah. I don't think I've ever seen the inside of your apartment before.	Aaaaauuuuugggggghhhhhh!!!!!!
Well, that's different, Kim, that's hilarious. This is life-changing.	Said the father of my unborn child. Heh!
You know what else is pretty classic when the coffee guy asks for money, you say, "Sorry, my wallet's in my other pair of mocha-chinos." That always gets 'em.	We can get through this.
Scone is also a a funny word; but I don't like them, I prefer croissants.	Ah, dammit. I have to go to the hospital.
Please! I'll be fine. You be careful you're walking for two!Call Turk.	You're clearly freaking out, so, um, you need to promise me that you're gonna find somebody to talk to about this while I'm gone.
Come on, buddy. Please pick up.	All right! All right! Now listen! This is a hospital, not a discotheque! Turn that damn thing off!
No problem. I'll just go chill at my deck with a little vino.	Awwwwww!
Unfortunately, it was still a hangout spot for gay seniors.	No problem. I'll just go chill at my deck with a little vino.
All right! That's enough! I have seen Les Mis over a dozen times, so I have nothing against giant queens per se, all right? In fact, my life would be a whole lot easier if I was married to one of you guys.... Excuse me.	Unfortunately, it was still a hangout spot for gay seniors.
Why didn't you answer your phone when I called you?	Hold up! Hold up! Hold up! "Las Vegas Police Department." Hello?
Ohhhh. Wait, let me hear it.	I was dancing.
There's no flag up there.	Hey, mojambo. This here's our new flagpole. Why don't you show Old Glory a little respect and snap off a salute?
Are you insane?	We're at war, my friend. All American flags are on backorder. What do you want me to do in the meantime, run a pirate flag up there? Maybe turn the whole building into a pirate ship? I could put a captain's wheel up on the roof...catch a parrot somehow...slap on an eyepatch...go to work with a caulk-gun, seal her up, make her watertight I can take her out to sea.
Whatever. I'm I I I'm not saluting a pole!	Nah. I'm a pirate.
Mrs. Zeebee, I know that we were hoping that the pain around your areola was simple mastitis, but it turns out that it's breast cancer.	New ways to torture that guy. See?
Trust me, I know what you're going through. Just yesterday, I found out that my girlfriend	I can't believe this is happening to me.
I was trying to!	'Scuse us!Dude, please tell me you're not comparing getting cancer to knocking up your girlfriend.
What about you and the motorcycle accident guy!?	You can't pawn your personal stuff off on your patients!
I have to tell you guys something, but you have to promise not to laugh, okay?	I'm sorry, J.D., but you knew that this could happen when you had sex.
Okay, on the night of said conception, uh, Kim and I nuded up, and um...the dirty talk began, and I got a little over-excited.	Right. Sure.
No, I do. I find it gets the ladies going, but I occasionally get wrapped up in it myself, especially when I use some of my different voices....	Ooooh! She like-a the dirty talk!
Anyhoo, there was some unexpected friendly fire. And, uh, even though I never got a chance to enter..."the village"...uh, there was a..."airstrike" on one of the outlying regions	He does.
Anyway, I spoke to the gals up in OB-G, and they said it's not uncommon for a woman to get pregnant even if there was no actual penetration.	Thank you.
No, I didn't have a condom.And, uh, we decided not to have sex because here's the kicker I didn't want to get her pregnant.	What you trying to tell us is that you...never actually had sex with her?
As I thought about how Mrs. Zeebee and I had gotten such a raw deal, I realized how easy it was for doctors to see themselves in their patients.Whether it's in the choices they made in their life...	Oh, no you didn't!
...or the choices they didn't make...	You're killing me.
Either way, it forces you to face your problems head-on.	No, I punched a whale, right in the face. Down he went, like Liston.
Or not.	There you are. You ready to grab some lunch so that we can talk?
You know what, Kim, I don't think I can handle this right now.	Or not.
I can't believe he got that! We are so ready for that charades tournament on Saturday!	Teaching CPR to underprivileged youth at Lincoln Middle School on 18th Street.
Traitor!	You know, Kim, I'm sorry but I really have no idea.
You have no idea what I'm going through.	You're right! That'll work. But still, you need to man up and talk to her.
Yeah, that you planned with your wife, whose middle name you know.	Really? 'Cause the last time I checked, I was having a kid, too.
What if Kim and I don't end up together? Okay? I already have enough trouble meeting girls. Can you imagine it now? "Hey, how you doin'? I'm J.D., and this little bugger right here already hates ya for not being his real mommy! Wanna get freaky? I'm apparently very fertile!"	I knew it was something Puerto Rican.
Oh, man. This just sucks.	Mrs. Zeebee's CAT-scan came back.
Mrs. Zeebee, unfortunately the cancer isn't localized just to your breast. We're gonna have to start chemo right away.	Oh, man. This just sucks.
The most important thing to remember when you see yourself in a patient is that they're not actually you.In fact, sometimes, they're actually who we wish we had the courage to be.	Mrs. Zeebee, unfortunately the cancer isn't localized just to your breast. We're gonna have to start chemo right away.
Yeah.	You know what? I'm gonna get through this. Just you watch.
Right then, I knew exactly what I had to do, come hell or high water.	Yeah.
Whoa! Oof!	Right then, I knew exactly what I had to do, come hell or high water.
What the hell?	Uh-huh! I got your Juanita. Juanita, huh? Well you can Jua-nita this right there.
Are you gonna let me down anytime soon?	It's now or never.
As I acted like a flag, I sensed that the Janitor learned nothing from this experience.Dr. Cox, on the other hand, got halfway there. He may always be angry at work, but he had learned to control himself when it counts.	Not until you spend a little time acting like a flag.
As for me, I finally came through, even if it was a little late.	That's okay, 'cause we've got your favorite yogurt.
Can we talk?	As for me, I finally came through, even if it was a little late.
Dr. Cox and Jordan weren't the only ones with kid troubles. My brand new girlfriend was pregnant, and we were trying to decide what to do.	Ohh, thanks for including me.
Should we keep it or get rid of it?	Dr. Cox and Jordan weren't the only ones with kid troubles. My brand new girlfriend was pregnant, and we were trying to decide what to do.
You're right.	I dunno. If we keep it, it'll just end up in the dumpster.
Of course I do! What about you? Any nieces or nephews?	So, uh, let's go.... Um.... Do you like kids?
Oh, no!	Yeah, I have a nephew. Although he's forty-five. But occasionally I do have to change his diaper he was kicked by a horse.
So beautiful! I hope you keep some ice in this locket, 'cause you're making me hot all over!	Yeah.
What? Oh! Sure! Uh, I'll take a look at it first thing tomorrow morning, huh?	Actually, it's the only picture I have of my biological father. D'you wanna see it?
Yeah, I'm not a big fan of adoption.	What? Oh! Sure! Uh, I'll take a look at it first thing tomorrow morning, huh?
I know I will.	You think if it's a girl, you'd doink her?
I'm totally fine with stalling.	Yep. All right, well, look, we don't need to make this decision tonight, right? I mean, plenty of time.
Okay, Brown Bear, commence Operation Brown Cub! Suitcase!	He's here! And now we can have our baby!
Stylish big daddy hat!	Check.
Big-time collegiate drum-line!	Check.
Yeah, let me get twenty-three cheeseburgers, twenty-three milkshakes Miguel, if you don't stop drumming, you're not getting fries.Miguel has such raw talent, but his attitude keeps getting in the way.	We had to, honey. J.D. promised the band that we'd feed them.
What are you doing?	Of course I have your suitcase, honey.
Fo' shizzle.	Sometimes when you need a miracle, you have to pray extra-extra hard. You wanna help me out?
I thought that we could discuss abortion over appletinis.	Abortions.What?
But what if having this baby is a huge mistake for us?	She's right, J.D. Every life is precious.
But what if	Okay, I'm gonna make this real simple: No abortions, okay?
Lemme finish! What if the parents were like abusive drug addicts who would neglect their kids?	No abortions!
Really?	Oh, well, in that case it'd be okay.
Kirsten Dunst?	This sucks. I mean, the hardest decision I've had to make in the last year was what hairstyle to get. And even then, all I did was open up an US Magazine, close my eyes and pick a random celebrity.
Ohhh!	Owen Wilson.
You know what might give us an inkling? We haven't technically had sex yet. That might help us find out if we're on the same page...you know...in the boudoir.	Yeah.You know what's making this so hard? This relationship is so new, we can't tell if we have a chance of making this work long-term.
I'm sorry, I'm being an idiot, aren't I.	Are you hitting on me?
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...!...Yeah!	Nope. Clothes off. We're doing it.
Laverne? Is this your Jesus?	What did you two just do? Because I sure don't see any wedding rings!
we both make good money	Yes.
your boobs'll get huge	Yes.
I can finally buy Beanie Babies without feeling weird, and kids are great!	True.
Tax deductions!	Which we already said.
Ohhh! Yeah! That's some	Ohhh! Nice one!
Nice. Let's see, that's twenty cons and nineteen pros. I guess we gotta abort.	All right, so then what's the final tally?
Wait, I'm sorry. That's an eyelash, I made a wish. It's a tie abortion's off.	Yep.
Every couple has its share of problems.	Okay, so now what?
Whether it's someone digging in...	And did you tell him not since the late 'eighties when you were trying to make it as "an actress"?
...or someone stealing your thunder.	Look, I'm not going to change who I am, all right? End o' story.
Still, nothing's worse than facing the biggest decision of your life and not getting anywhere.	Elliot's got everything covered.
You don't see that every day.	Don't you wish it was this easy head's yes, tail's no.
All right, Justin. What should my specialty be, oncology or radiology?I go someplace wonderful.	Oh, I was just gonna walk around.
So what is Elliot's plan?	Keith! Private!
Ahh! Should I have a baby, too?	Ah, it's really simple: See, when Carla says "I'm thirsty," Elliot'll say, "Oh no, I forgot the ice chips." That's when I walk in, ice in hand, and I say, "Christopher Turk, at your cervix!"
Ah, this is way over Justin's head. He's never been in love. Not real love, anyway.	You know, I'm a little preoccupied right now. Why don't you ask your unicorn?
Why don't you just yank it out?	Dude, help! I'm totally stuck!
Hi. ... Yes, I know he missed your wedding, too. ... All right, hold on.	Hey, baby, look, I ... Yeah, he he's right here. ... Hold on.
So...you decided what you wanna do?	Hey.
One, two, three.	Okay.
Appletinis.	I got nothing.
Um, we don't prob well, there's a lot to con because we'll probably...maybe not.	Um, maybe...we well, if we do we can then we...maybe not.
Whore!	Oh, we're not judging you.
Yeah, but what if we don't feel anything?	It's not a logical decision. If it's right, you'll feel it in your heart.
Carla's having a C-section.	Maybe that's your answer.
Miguel, please!	Guys. I have an announcement.
They say you never realize your capacity to love until you have a child. It can change who you are...	The baby's out, but the cord was wrapped around its neck, so...we had to take it to the NICU.
...they can fill you with joy...	"Where do babies come from?" Well.... When a mommy and a daddy love each other very, very much, sometimes they close their eyes...and they make a wish.
...it can even give your heart the answer you thought you'd never find.	Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce you to Isabella Turk.
Let's do this.	...it can even give your heart the answer you thought you'd never find.
Carla discovered that her baby wasn't the only one who loved breast feeding.	Nice!
Dr. Kelso discovered change was not always welcome.	I could eat.
Still, the best discovery was learning that someone I drummed out of medicine had landed on his feet.	Awwwww. Now I'm at the end of both lines.
Frontsies!	Still, the best discovery was learning that someone I drummed out of medicine had landed on his feet.
Mmm. That's what we call "Cabbage-tastic."	Hey, Dr. D.
Eww. How about a second of that dynamite ape impression.I'm sorry, Cindy, once he's in monkey mode, you can't stop him. But who would want to, right? Cheers.Hey, Kim! Just checkin' to see if your socks are back on, since I knocked 'em off last night! Helloooooo!	Oh, I love this job I screw up, nobody gets hurt. Except Cindy.
Right? Zoom	And so is this: Way to hit that, player!
Zoooom!	Zoom
It may have already come up.	Do not tell my daughter she has a vagina! I'm serious! Hm!? Hm!? Hmm!?!
How great is that!	Dr. Lemke! You're gonna love this. We're a husband and wife piano playing team, only I have no hands!With my head!
On the bright side, you have beautiful nubs.	This is my wife, Sally. She lost her thumbs last month when our pet Komodo dragon, Morty, got out of his cage.
Oh, my God!	STOP FINISHING MY AWESOME JOKES!
I get her first because we're best friends. Elliot. Ted, give it!	Yeah, you got decent hands. Go ahead.
So, Carla, how much time do you think you'll take off?	When do I Besides now. Look, come on, it is a human life I'll focus. Give it to me! Right here!
So "Rajesh" isn't one of those cool black homely names like "Anforny"?	Those guys are Indian.
Ohh!	No, "Rajesh" is like "Steve" in India.
You always buy me a cotton candy after the game to celebrate my good sportsmanship.	Yeah.
Yeah, well, I'm very close to a tantrum.	Yeah, well, you know what? I can't be buying you stuff all the time!
Come on, Vijay, first you dunk on me and yell, "Who's your bitch!" now you want free medical advice?	Could you guys look at my shoulder? I tweaked it pretty good.
I'm sorry, my friend, but that's just not ethical.	I'll give you twenty bucks.
Put that away, Turk! That's back-alley money!	All right, relax, you're fine. Just ice it when you get home.
I'm sorry, cotton candy man, but unlike my friend, here, I have no interest in being sued for Do I smell blue?	Hey. I'll give you twenty bucks if you check out my rash.
Ohhhhh! You crafty, crafty man that is fluffing up nicely. Hey, give me some money, I'm jonesing for some c-squared.	Just added the dye.
You heartless bastard. All right, let's see your disgusting rash.	Oh, you don't want my back-alley money, do you?
I don't care if we had extra coffee money left over I don't feel right taking that guy's cash.	What the hell, Kersh!
Sometimes everything you need to know is on the side of a coffee cup.	Is anybody planning on emptying that?
"...they may deceive you..."	Greetings, customer! What can I get you?
"In the end, those same people will make you wish you'd never met them."Maybe that wasn't just a rash on cotton candy man.	I'm just gonna go ahead and tip myself for calling this one! Thank you, me!
Goochie-goochie-goo. Turk. Now.	Isabella, this is the man you'll be competing with for your father's love.
Ohhh. I hope it wasn't the corn-dog guy. They never got along.	He's gone.
Are you crazy? You could get sued! Secondly, I can't believe you went to the mall without me I specifically told you I needed to buy loafers.	Yeah, but then I'd have to give the money back to all the others.
As a matter of fact, I already did.	Well, I don't see you giving the money back to cotton candy man!
Turk, we're doctors. We live by a moral code.	I can't believe you told!
Why are you being so weird lately? You won't loan me money for cotton candy, you're charging strangers for medical advice, and now you're worried about your hand? Who are you?	J.D., what the hell! I'm a surgeon that coulda hit my hand!
Great work, everybody! Thank you!	"...and what did you do with Turk?"
I know. In seven months, I'm gonna have a family, too.	Wow, I got a family.
Please, this isn't about that. It's just that I looked all over, I never found any balloons. You'd think there'd be some balloons.	J.D., for the last time, nothing happened.
Well that sucks, 'cause I was counting on you to make it look easy so I know I can handle it when my turn comes.	I look at Isabella, and I get really scared. And I'm gonna need you to be there to help me through this.
Turk, you're at the beginning of your career. You know you're gonna make plenty of money.	Awesome.
You're gonna be just fine.	It's good to hear that from you, thank you.
...Totally fine.	I suppose so.
Would you mind telling me that I'm gonna be fine, Turk? Am I gonna be fine? I think I'm gonna be fine!	Yeah.
I really like her.	Well, I would, but I don't know how much you like Kim.
Thanks.	Then you're gonna be fine.
Opportunities are everywhere......Whether it's accepting an old job...	Thanks.
...or taking a new job.	Hey.Now clean up this mess.
As for me, I was just excited to have the opportunity to get to know the mother of my child better.	I'd...like to join your practice.
Cool! Is it over at County? 'Cause that way I can drop you off every morning.	I got offered a new job.
Oh. That's gonna be a little rough on my scooter.	It's in Tacoma, Washington.
Not only were the new suites super expensive, they were absolutely ruing my figure.Turk and Carla had just brought their new baby home.	Oh, not now.Never. He's in a coma.
As for me, my pregnant girlfriend just moved away, but I was still keeping things spicy.	Happy birthday, sweetheart. We'll talk later.
Oh, of course I miss you, baby! Want to see a picture of me missing you? Hold on. Oh, thanks. Do you want to see a picture of my rock-hard abs? Ok, hold on. No, no, I've always had an innie. She wants to see a picture of my ass.	As for me, my pregnant girlfriend just moved away, but I was still keeping things spicy.
I am your superior! what the ?Oh, hey, Elliot, I'll have him back to you in one second.	Oh, J.D., I don't want -
Actually, keith, it's a little like that.	What the hell are you doing? Oh, hey, Elliot.
One areola shot, real quick.	Little bit.
Now that Elliot was private practice, there were tons of perks. For one, Dr. Kelso still refused to speak to her.	One areola shot, real quick.
Still, the biggest perk is that at 5:00, she gets to dump her patients on someone else and go home.	Hey, Dr. Kelso. Oh, if you're a doody face, don't say anything.
He said in a sarcastic tone we've all come to know as "Coxsian."	Fine, I don't want to go home, anyway.
To me, the best thing about Elliot is all her extra cash.	Woman, the turks can handle anything.
"7- car pile-up" would be a good name for a rock band.	Hey, roomie! I went shopping. Oh, this couch reminded me of my grandpa. He used to drive around in a car just like it. You know, until he was killed in that 7-car pile-up.
Why stop at hardwood?	Yeah, you actually told me that on the day that he died. Anywho, I was thinking maybe we should put in some new hardwood floors.
Careful. Trampoline floors take some gettin' used to. But I love 'em.I like bouncing, but it is dangerous.	Yay, the new floors are in!
You should see all the sweet new toys elliot bought.So, how are things at the homestead?	Is that hickory?
I don't know if it's really a load of crap. it's just that, well, if you	I mean, seriously, since when does working at a hospital suddenly make you a better person? It's such a load of crap.
I just thought, you know, money, like a sell-out, so	I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
I guess I do.or even just a little surprise waiting at home.	Wait, do you actually agree with dr.
Sorry, brown bear. Hey, mocha cup.	J.D., have you seen carla?
I am not jealous.	ooh, hey, chuckles! If you're a doody face, just keep walking.I'm not mad.
I do not! OK, resist smelling that coconut goodness that caresses your tresses! Don't do it! Whatever.	Oh, please, J.
Well, Elliot's not here, keith.	Put that down. Elliot said that until you admit you're jealous, You can't use any of her things.
No, never, ok? And thanks a lot, because the one hour that Kim and I had to actually talk, I was stuckin your stupid boyfriend's scissor-hold.	He wrestled you, didn't he? See, Keith got his old high school uniform so that he actually incorporated it into our love play. I'm the lesbian coach and he's the captain of the wrestling team, and he turns me. So, have you decided to admit that you're jealous?
No, not particularly.	Oh, don't you just love the way his thighs feel against your ears?
What's the matter? Your aryan boyfriend had to go to a rally, so now you have to watch me?	Hi, J. D. Relax, I'm at the hospital.
I didn't hear her coming.In a sec. I really miss you.	Whatever.
I did.	Hey, everyone.
Dr.	And back to insulting you, she's been gone 6 weeks, Bobo, the 6 days that you're referring to are the 6 days you actually worked this month.
Or how he found a way to eliminate any facetime with the patients.	Thanks.
He didn't even bothered to learn the new interns' names.	How does he always know?
I always wondered what he did in his office all day.	Then our reference is to the others, you will be Slagathor.
My daydreams are crazy.	Ask again later. Why would I say that?
Since Elliot bought a house, I had to look for a place to live. Time to get out of my head and into an apartment.	Ooohdizzy.
Hey, Dr.	Since Elliot bought a house, I had to look for a place to live. Time to get out of my head and into an apartment.
You guys, in case I find an apartment I like I need someone to write a reference for me.	Elliot, if you - Kill you!
Can you excuse me a second?! Did you bring her back in stubbing a newspapers?	J.
Why do you keep a globe on your janitor cart? Guess i get lost.That's Iraq.	Typical Dorian.Really? Point to Iraq.
Hey, buddy, You've found an apartment yet? No, man, i feel like an idiot so I've been reading up on this whole Iraq war situation.	That's how you get people around you to listen to you, Bob.
Since I've spent this afternoon researching the war in Iraq, I couldn't wait to dive right into the spirit of debate.	Why the hell not? That ought to do it.
Prepare to be dazzled.	I'll debate Iraq with you.
You've that globe nearby?	Ok, in my opinion we should be looking for Bin Laden in Pakistan.
In life it seems we all have a role to play. Some of us are meant to be loved, and some of us, unfortunately, are meant to be hated.	You've that globe nearby?
For Dr. Kelso, he wouldn't have it any other way.	Good night minions, Slugathor.
Oh really, Donna, I'm ruining the neighborhood? At least I'm quiet; were you guys having sex last night or raping a baboon?	You are ruining our neighborhood!
My bad...	I wasn't home last night.
Donna! Ahhh!!!	I'm gonna beat your ass!
Alright, Mr. Mariani, mazel tov; you are the proud owner of yet another kidney stone! Did you try laying off the red meat, buddy?	You smell like my mom...
Oh man, Kim is having her first ultrasound tommorow.	I'm trying, Doc, but it's hard.
Are you kidding me? I can't just up and leave, I got to find an apartment I live in a T.P.	Oh, there's nothing like that first ultrasound. Bring tissue.
Is cuddling bad now?	'Dorian' again! Ye I don't know if it's the hormones or if the baby is actually eating the bitch cells, but Jordan has softened; in fact last night she... she asked me to cuddle.
'Dorian'. Oh, damn it now I'm doing it. Careful, he's going fetus.	He can't possibly make it my fault, right?
The secret to a great road trip is to get as many people as possible to come along.	'Dorian'. Oh, damn it now I'm doing it. Careful, he's going fetus.
So you guys in?	The secret to a great road trip is to get as many people as possible to come along.
You know, Keith, if the buyer hadn't been an undercover federal, Elliot would be a slave somewhere. There wouldn't be any uncomftorable sexual tension between us, and you and I would probably be best friends.	Keith, they tried to sell me.
Ye...	Ye?
This way.	Oh Keith, the woman is 96 years old there will be plenty of weekends for that; Road trip!
Road trip! Where's chocolate bear?	Ghandi, I'm great at this stuff. Don't ever talk to Jordan again.
I knew that little tant baby will eventually ruin everything.	Getting to know his daughter.
Rowdy needs to see the world.	Uhh, I can't.
Oh! Alright!	Do you guys know where I can find a giant car wash?
Carla got some serious moves! She can even do an inverted spread - legs pole spin. You know if thats how they called, It's not like I've take a pole dancing class or anything.	I don't know but there is a stripper pole in the back!
Nice cover.	Carla got some serious moves! She can even do an inverted spread - legs pole spin. You know if thats how they called, It's not like I've take a pole dancing class or anything.
Ted, who's driving?	Don't touch the kimonos, those are for Dr Kelso's various masseuses.
Of course, Jonathan 3000.	We are cruising at a comfortable speed, Dr. Dorian. We should arrive on schedule. Could you possible do me a small favor?
You got it, pal.	Could you rub that spot off my dashboard?
Alright.	Oh yeah, just like that.
It can get lonely on the road, even for computers. But this is gonna be great, right?	That's the stuff, you bitch!
No, no, no, no, no. Carla darling, everything is fine with the baby, fine with the Hi what's that? Now I'll let you out when you calm down!	He's not answering... Something is wrong with the baby I'm telling Elliot to turn around.
That's enough! If you guys can't get along just sit down and don't talk.	Kick his ass, Ted!
Whar are you doing here?	Amen to that.
Elliot, Stop!	I don't think he knew we were moving...
He's fine, let's get going.	Where did everyone go?
See? He's great. And so is Ted.	Hi, wait, no. coming back. Hello. Who is making pancakes?
You guys, Turk told me how amazing it was when he say Izzy's ultrasound, I can't miss this, I just, I won't.	Ahhh! Oh... I think you popped it back in the joint.
There are a lot of times in life when you just got to take control.	Can I say something? I don't know this young man, I wish I did. I admire his spirit! And if he says we must continue on then I say I am in!
Wait, give me those keys. I'm driving. Next stop Kim town.	There are a lot of times in life when you just got to take control.
Chill out, Ted.	Uhh, that tunnel looks kinda small.
why would they build a tunnel that an R.V. won't fit ? I can admit that the tunnel was more narrow than I thought but the damage wasn't too bad. Keith just had to stop accidentily making the 'please honk your horn' sign to to passing truckers.	Chill out, Ted.
You guys, here's the hospital.	Knock it off, Rochelle.
I don't know, I'll rent a car or something. Go take care of Dr. Cox; tell him Gladys is thinking of him, he'll know it's me.	Well, how are you gonna get home?
Maybe he should lay down.	Very well, stranger. I shall toast you with my hardest wine.
In life, it's never easy to know what's waiting for you on the other side of the door.	Plan B. Also, lucky for you - Enid has gone blind from glaucoma, now - here's what I need.
Surprise.	In life, it's never easy to know what's waiting for you on the other side of the door.
Come here for a second, come here. Is this your office?	Oh my God... J.D.!
Sometimes you find a moment that knocks you on your ass.	Jordan, I love you.
How's our baby doing, huh?	Sometimes you find a moment that knocks you on your ass.
Other times, it just takes your breath away.	J.D., I had a miscarrige.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I just... it's kinda weird, there was this thing that I never met and now it's gone and I kinda miss it.	I should have told you earlier, I just didn't want to do it on the phone and... are you O.K.?
I was alredy kinda looking for doing all those parents things you hear about, you know like - change diapers, first steps, playing catch. Turk was gonna even teach me how to throw like a guy, so...	I know...
No... no, c'mon. Come back from this in a couple of months and we'll pick up whereever we left off. I mean, I guess it will be a little more casual, we should probably won't talk without either one of us wearing full body condoms.	Unless it was a girl, then you could just throw like yourself. Can I ask you something? Were we just staying together cuz' we were having a kid?
Did they?	What if I... wasn't coming back because they offered me a permanent position here?
We sat there all night and talked about everything. How we felt about each other, whether we can handle a long distance relationship, did she ever see herself come back to 'The Sacred Heart', will a pizza place deliver to a bench at three in the morning... they would... And on the end of it all, we realized that without a baby in the picture, the best thing to do is to say goodbye, stay friends and just hope that our paths cross again. Someday.	Yeah...
So then I took a $900 cab ride home, and voilà: here I am.	We sat there all night and talked about everything. How we felt about each other, whether we can handle a long distance relationship, did she ever see herself come back to 'The Sacred Heart', will a pizza place deliver to a bench at three in the morning... they would... And on the end of it all, we realized that without a baby in the picture, the best thing to do is to say goodbye, stay friends and just hope that our paths cross again. Someday.
Cos' I couldn't wait to rub a little jelly on your treasure trail. I need to see if your kidney stone dissolved yet. J... D... I always do that.	Bummer. Now why am I back in here again?
And the bad ones, that makes you mad.	It's a girl... we're having a baby girl.
Alright, let's take a look.	Theodore!
And I could never be mad at Kim for giving me a bad surprise.	Alright, let's take a look.
Because at least she was straight with me.	Wow...
When a patient doesn't have insurance, you have to work around the system. First, you have to find someone who's recently died.	All right, let's find her a room.
Cool, Mr. Rabinowitz just kicked it! Oh, don't worry, he put his peep in an electrical socket. You can't do that.	When a patient doesn't have insurance, you have to work around the system. First, you have to find someone who's recently died.
Then you have to convince the morgue guy to sit on the paperwork so the deceased's bed stays open.	Cool, Mr. Rabinowitz just kicked it! Oh, don't worry, he put his peep in an electrical socket. You can't do that.
Then you have to get the floor nurses to play along.	Deal.
Then you have to find a surgeon to do the work pro bono.	Enjoy your kosher meal, Mr. Rabinowitz.
But, most importantly, you can't let any higher-ups find out that a patient is uninsured, even if they're the ones who brought her here in the first place.	I got this one.
Dr. Kelso, we need to talk to you.	Bob, I want to thank you for doing all this, even though I don't have any...
Uh, we want to go somewhere with you.	What is it?
A spa. We'd like to get some massages.	Okay. Where?
Turk, why are you looking?	We're gonna get a little graphic here, so you fellas might want to look the other way, or not, it's your choice.
Sir, how are you? Lookin' good.	Hey, good morning, fellas.
But thank you for including us.	No, not that happy.
Here comes Ted! Go, go, go, pull!	My bad, I was hanging out with J.D. and Rowdy, and we decided to pull a prank that we used to do back in the day.
Sneak hug!	Nothing ever changes. The artist formerly known as Prince is still just Prince. My ex-wife is still pretty much my wife. Grey's Anatomy always wraps up every episode with some cheesy voiceover that ties together all of the storylines, which, incidentally, is my least favorite device on television. Newbie continually will try to violate my "no touching" policy. Uh-huh. And Republicans will forever try to raise...
Look, milady, I know it stinks that we're removing your foot and plan to eat it tonight at the Healing Feast, but you wouldn't believeth how much worse this would have been even a few years ago.	Well, you're going to lose the dead tissue, but, thanks to modern medicine, you're gonna keep most of your foot. You wouldn't believe how much worse it would have been even a few years ago.This might hurteth a little.
Buga buga.	Unga.
Unga bunga tonga runga, katonga patonga bonga.	Unga! Unga! Unga!
I may have killed you, but I think I was upset about it.	Unga bunga tonga runga, katonga patonga bonga.
And so, in the end, I knew what Elliot said about the way things were has forever changed the way we all thought about them.	Maybe we should post the transcript for your "nothing ever changes" rant in the cancer ward for the chemo patients as a little pick-me-up. Oh, and FYI, I happen to like the voiceovers on Grey's Anatomy, except for when they're really vague and generic.
Everyone reacts differently to unpleasant discoveries. Some people get angry.	I don't have insurance. It's okay, I can get by.
Others are admittedly a tad more dramatic.	Save my seat.
Oh, my God, he's gone. I think I'm gonna be sick.	Others are admittedly a tad more dramatic.
God, please!	I mean, guys, I know all about bottoming out. All right? It wasn't long ago that I was out there , on my knees, praying to the gods for help.
Please, God!	Lord!
Why?	Bring him back!
How dare you steal our dog?	Gimme that!
We used to, but if you're gonna threaten to fire us over taking a pair of scrubs, why wouldn't we think you'd fire us for treating an uninsured patient?	Well, why didn't we do what we always do? Why didn't you fix it while I turned my back and pretend not to notice? You know the dance.
And just like that, we got our old scrubs back.	Yeah, when you took away the scrubs, you took away the trust, and without trust, everything falls apart.
I'm telling you guys, this could have been a much bigger moment.	And just like that, we got our old scrubs back.
Even though I was the only one who knew how to embrace life, we all left thinking about how important trust is.Dr. Cox let Elliot keep her trust in humankind a while longer.	I'm telling you guys, this could have been a much bigger moment.
Carla protected the trust that we have in her by coming clean.	Yeah.
I'm cool with keeping Stephen. We've gotten to know each other quite well.	Now, at least, you can both have one.
That's Stephen. Don't ask me how I know that.	Well, how are we supposed to know who's who?
As for Dr. Kelso, he knew that trusting us again was probably foolish.	That's Stephen. Don't ask me how I know that.
Still, it was worth it.	Good night, sir.
