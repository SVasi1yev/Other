You know how I'm totally down with the rap music?	'Sup.	Hey, Turk.	The hospital doesn't want to be sued. Being sued is not a good thing.
Chris Turk's my best friend. We roomed together in college...We roomed together in med school...Hell, we even got accepted by the same hospital.	Dude, be whiter.	You know how I'm totally down with the rap music?	'Sup.
Right. My question is this: if we're both singing along, and knowing that otherwise I would never use the word, am I allowed to say-	I got it.	Here's the thing: TuPac, DMX, Dr. Dre, in most of their songs, these artists use an extremely volatile racial slur... the "N" word.	Chris Turk's my best friend. We roomed together in college...We roomed together in med school...Hell, we even got accepted by the same hospital.
See, that's good for me to know. I didn't-I didn't know that.	No.	Right. My question is this: if we're both singing along, and knowing that otherwise I would never use the word, am I allowed to say-	I got it.
Hey, listen, I found us an apartment....	Finally, doctors, if there is a mistake, don't admit it to the patient. Of course, if the patient is deceased, and you're sure, you can feel free to tell him or her... anything.	See, that's good for me to know. I didn't-I didn't know that.	No.
I know. I would have laughed if you'd paused.	So, every male in my family is a doctor: my dad, my grand-dad, and my brother. I guess that's why dad gave me a guy's name, made me play sports, date girls. I'm joking.	Heh-heh. Hello.	Medical.
Your butt looks like two Pringles hugging.	Anyway, I know what you're thinking.	I know. I would have laughed if you'd paused.	So, every male in my family is a doctor: my dad, my grand-dad, and my brother. I guess that's why dad gave me a guy's name, made me play sports, date girls. I'm joking.
Hey, are we, like, racing?	I'm probably "Miss Hyper Competitive". I mean, it used to be a big problem for me. "Used to" - past tense.	No you don't.	Your butt looks like two Pringles hugging.
Please. I'm not that desperate.	Yes!	Hey, are we, like, racing?	I'm probably "Miss Hyper Competitive". I mean, it used to be a big problem for me. "Used to" - past tense.
Oh, yeah.	So, you do a lot of cardio, or...?	Please. I'm not that desperate.	Yes!
You ever notice how quickly some people make an impression?	Elliot Reid? John Dorian? Great. One: I am your resident, Dr. Jeffrey Steadman - not "Jeff". Two: Here are your manuals. This -	Oh, yeah.	So, you do a lot of cardio, or...?
Yeah.	I'm a tool. I'm a tool. I'm a tool, tool, tool, an unbelievably annoying tool.	You ever notice how quickly some people make an impression?	Elliot Reid? John Dorian? Great. One: I am your resident, Dr. Jeffrey Steadman - not "Jeff". Two: Here are your manuals. This -
Back to today.	Yeah. Finally, these are your beepers . From now on, they control your entire life. 'Kay? Thanks. Move it.	Yeah.	I'm a tool. I'm a tool. I'm a tool, tool, tool, an unbelievably annoying tool.
We'll talk later.	Place an IV for me.	Hi, doctor, I'm-	We're waiting for Dr. Cox.
Why are you telling her?	Time's up. Carla, would you do it for him, please? I also need an A.B.G.	Come on, you've done this to cadavers before. So this guy's alive, just poke it through his skin! Poke it through! Now!	I smell nice.
Well, how could you not be....	I was just frazzled.	I'm sure you did.	I knew the answer!
Oh, I know. Yeah.	You know with the...	Well, how could you not be....	I was just frazzled.
You could let me take you to dinner tomorrow night.Around seven.... Or eight.	Good. But thanks. If there's anything I can ever do for you, just	Oh, I know. Yeah.	You know with the...
But I	It's regular-strength Tylenol! Here's what'cha do: Get her to open her mouth, take a handful, and throw it at her. Whatever sticks, that's the correct dosage.	I was worried that it could exacerbate the patient's	What the hell are you doing?Did you actually just page me to find out how much Tylenol to give to Mrs. Lendsner?
Dr. Kelso, he's always telling me, you know, "You've gotta stay positive!"	And under no circumstances are you to compromise our "no talking" agreement.	But I	It's regular-strength Tylenol! Here's what'cha do: Get her to open her mouth, take a handful, and throw it at her. Whatever sticks, that's the correct dosage.
It's just that, this isn't really what I expected... You know...Most of my patients are, uh...older and sorta checked-out, mentally.	I'm gonna go ahead and say this just as carefully as possible so I don't overstate it: Dr. Kelso is the most evil human being on the planet. And may, in fact, be Satan, himself.	Dr. Kelso, he's always telling me, you know, "You've gotta stay positive!"	And under no circumstances are you to compromise our "no talking" agreement.
It's just that, do you really think we should be talking about this in front of....	Pumpkin, that's modern medicine. Advances that keep people alive who should have died a long time ago, back when they lost what made them people.Now, your job is to stay sane enough so that when someone does come in that you actually can help, you're not so brain-dead that you can't function. For the love of God, what!?	It's just that, this isn't really what I expected... You know...Most of my patients are, uh...older and sorta checked-out, mentally.

And there it is.	Fair enough, you want some real advice? If they find out the nurses are doing your procedures for you, your ass'll be kicked outta here so quick, it'll make your head spin.	You've been like a father to me.	Her? She's dead.Write this down, newbie: If you push around a stiff, nobody'll ask you to do anything.
....We're the chess club.	Hey, you got a stain.	And like that, I was back in high school. You see, surgical interns, they're all slice-'em-and-dice-'em. They're the jocks. Medical interns, we're trained to think about the body; diagnose, test. Medical interns, well....	Oww!
No. I was I was just making small talk.	Did you stick a penny in there?	I dunno.	Why a penny?
Why couldn't I do that? I hated him at that moment.	Come on, man, learn by doing! Learn by doing.	I think this needle's too big. I'm gonna get a nurse.	Fantastic.Just suck out the fluid with the giant needle.
Oh, you think?	Okay, uh, maybe the needle was just a little too big.	Why couldn't I do that? I hated him at that moment.	Come on, man, learn by doing! Learn by doing.
Tell him you think that's stupid. Tell him you need him.	That's why I came by. I think it's better if we both branched out a little. What do you think?	So, are you gonna are you gonna move your stuff in or what?	Nothing, ma'am, this is totally normal.
Well, I'll tell you one thing, the last thing in the world I wanna do is sleep wit'cha now!	Oh please, if you didn't want to sleep with me, you'd have done the same thing.	I thought we cared about each other....	Plus, it turns out, the guy was just sleeping; attached to a faulty monitor.
Okay.	Do me right here.	Well, I'll tell you one thing, the last thing in the world I wanna do is sleep wit'cha now!	Oh please, if you didn't want to sleep with me, you'd have done the same thing.
ARGH!	See!	Okay.	Do me right here.
Our date is is totally canceled!	Right. Pass me a trach. kit.Thanks.	ARGH!	See!
Yeah.	You're worried about being on-call tonight, aren't you.	Seems like a good kid.	Atta boy! Go get 'em, champ!Why are you here?
Call you?	Look, worst case scenario, you kill somebody, and that hangs over your head the rest of your life....But that is the absolute worst case scenario. Come on, newbie, look: Just have the nurses do all the stuff you're still too chicken to do, which I assume covers just about everything, and if you have a really rough admission	Yeah.	You're worried about being on-call tonight, aren't you.
Are you flirting with me?You are, aren't you!	I need to see you in Mr. Bursky's room.	I'll check on you every ten minutes, Mrs. Moreno, okay?	Bambi, come on. Let's go.
Why didn't anybody page me?	He crashed. The attending thinks it was a pulmonary embolism.No way anyone could have caught it. Anyhow, you have to pronounce him.	Are you flirting with me?You are, aren't you!	I need to see you in Mr. Bursky's room.
I'll never forget that moment, the way he looked exactly the same...only completely different. The shame that all I could think about was how hard this was for me.	Could you just pronounce him so I can go home?	Why didn't anybody page me?	He crashed. The attending thinks it was a pulmonary embolism.No way anyone could have caught it. Anyhow, you have to pronounce him.
I just wanted to help people.	Time of death 0200.	I'll never forget that moment, the way he looked exactly the same...only completely different. The shame that all I could think about was how hard this was for me.	Could you just pronounce him so I can go home?
He needs me?	Well, I need you to tell me that every once in a while, man.	Well, I think it's okay to be scared.	It's a good thing they make surgical masks, 'cause if they didn't, everyone would know that my face is like this the whole time...
Ask him to move in again.	Anyway, I just came to check up on you; see how you're doing.	He needs me?	Well, I need you to tell me that every once in a while, man.
Yeah, but she's, like, a second away from total renal failure.	I saw that you're still pushing to put Mrs. Pratt on the transplant list. Bad news, though, sport: she doesn't have the insurance to cover it.	Ah, there he is, my safety net.	How're you holding up?
They're still in there with him, sir.	Okay..... Uh, did you ask the Bursky family for permission to do an autopsy?	Yeah, but she's, like, a second away from total renal failure.	I saw that you're still pushing to put Mrs. Pratt on the transplant list. Bad news, though, sport: she doesn't have the insurance to cover it.
Just tell him you can't see Mr. Bursky again. He'll understand.	It's a teaching hospital, son, you gotta ask.	They're still in there with him, sir.	Okay..... Uh, did you ask the Bursky family for permission to do an autopsy?
See? Every story needs a good guy.	Why, sure, sport.	Sir, do you do you think I could skip just this one?	Just tell him you can't see Mr. Bursky again. He'll understand.
I am pretty tired!	In fact, why don't you just head on home. You look kinda tired.	See? Every story needs a good guy.	Why, sure, sport.
Crystal clear.	Dr. Dorian, do you not realize that you're nothing but a large pair of scrubs to me? For God's sake, the only reason I carry this chart around is so I can pretend to remember your damn names! Now look, if the patient has insurance, you treat them; if they don't, you show them the door.And if somebody dies, you get the autopsy. You get it by rounds tomorrow morning, or I'll be scratching your name off my chart! Are we clear!?Answer me!!!	I am pretty tired!	In fact, why don't you just head on home. You look kinda tired.
I don't get it, if he's the jerk, then who's the good guy?	Great, sport.	Crystal clear.	Dr. Dorian, do you not realize that you're nothing but a large pair of scrubs to me?

And I believed him...	Look at me. You can do this.	Oh God, no.	We gotta relieve the pressure in his chest. J.D., do it.
...You know, kinda.	Chest-tube tray.	And I believed him...	Look at me. You can do this.
You can do this. You have to do this.	Come on, baby, let's go; chop-chop.	...You know, kinda.	Chest-tube tray.
Okay, gimme the tube.I can't get it through the pleura.	J.D., cut him or lose him.	You can do this. You have to do this.	Come on, baby, let's go; chop-chop.
Okay, connect it, please, Carla.	Well, don't be gentle, get it in there.	Okay, gimme the tube.I can't get it through the pleura.	J.D., cut him or lose him.
No way!	Normal rhythm.	Okay, connect it, please, Carla.	Well, don't be gentle, get it in there.
You're leaving?	Eh? It's a piece of cake.That's your patient.	No way!	Normal rhythm.
You see, I can't survive on my own.	I forgive her.	The worst part was knowing, right then, that I could never forgive her.	If you're talking about getting the Bursky autopsy, I already called the family for you. And they said fine, and to thank you, and I'm sorry. ...They didn't say that last part, I did.
Even now, when I finally get to go home, in the back of my head, I'll know the hospital's still here, wide awake.	I'm a dork. I'm a dork! I'm a dork. ...I'm a dork.	You see, I can't survive on my own.	I forgive her.
But what the hell. The most important thing is that I got through my first three days without looking like a complete idiot.	Bambi! Get out while you still can.	Even now, when I finally get to go home, in the back of my head, I'll know the hospital's still here, wide awake.	I'm a dork. I'm a dork! I'm a dork. ...I'm a dork.
Nooo....	Ohh... you want to hit that!	Just give her a chance, man.	Okay, dude, why is she here all the time?
No. She's just a friend, man.	Yeah!	Nooo....	Ohh... you want to hit that!
I think it's healthy hanging out with a girl without the ultimate goal being sex. You know?	Yeah.	No. She's just a friend, man.	Yeah!
I dunno.	Unfortunately, Radar, I'm fresh out of gold stars. Multilobar pneumonia at 31...? How much does this guy smoke?	Done. Copied. And Highlighted.	I need to see his chart
Oh. I know, I was just totally kidding with you.	What tests have you ordered?	Oh, I don't smoke, so... zero packs.	Well, let's hear it...
I like Will. That actually makes this harder.	He was... We're all in on it.	Oh. I know, I was just totally kidding with you.	What tests have you ordered?
Not like that.There it is.	Excellent.	When you say the word "cancer", every person reacts the same way.	Cancer.
Means, "You're really coming along as a doctor."	I'm, um, I'm just happy you haven't messed up yet today.	Means, "Great idea!"	You do whatever you want.
Means, Don't ever touch him.	Don't. Ever. Touch me.	Means, "You're really coming along as a doctor."	I'm, um, I'm just happy you haven't messed up yet today.
Okay, good!	But thank you for apologizing.	Ahhh, the comfortable silences.	No, you shouldn't have.
No, see, nothing needs to be clear.	I I just want to make one thing clear.	Okay, good!	But thank you for apologizing.
So, right now, the one thing that I want you to think about......How would you like to sound like this?	I had to scare him, but I had the sense he'd heard it all before. Luckily, part of being a doctor is your ability to improvise.	Yeah, well, Will, you're on a slippery slope, man.	Are you sure? 'Cause, that's how it first hit me.
No, it's not.	Let me see.This is so cool!	So, right now, the one thing that I want you to think about......How would you like to sound like this?	I had to scare him, but I had the sense he'd heard it all before. Luckily, part of being a doctor is your ability to improvise.
It's not a toy.Would you like to play a game?	Bwiddy-bwiddy-bwiddy. Okay, doc.	No, it's not.	Let me see.This is so cool!
Look, man, you're a great patient. I like you enough to hope I never see you again. But, I promise you, if you keep smoking, you'll be back here. I bet my own life on that.	Sometimes, if all you have is old words, all you can do is put them together and hope they say something new.	It's not a toy.Would you like to play a game?	Bwiddy-bwiddy-bwiddy. Okay, doc.
Done forever. He swore to me. I just, I reached him! I reached him.	No "last one"? 'Cause the last ones are better than sex, trust me, I've had about a thousand of them.	Yuh-huh!	Forever?
Excuse me?	Do you know what you've just done? You just lost all lap-dog privileges.	I need to know how we're going to fix this thing with Will.	Time for a bold move.
I'm not your lap-dog.	No more walkies, no more treats, no more following me around the hospital.	Excuse me?	Do you know what you've just done? You just lost all lap-dog privileges.
That must be lonely.	No one.	Well, who really knows him? I mean, who does he hang out with here?	He's just Dr. Cox.He's always like that.
It's not.	Well, actually, you have a point. I guess watching the game by yourself with a scotch isn't, really, the only way to watch a game, huh. I don't know. I just, I've always thought of needing people as a sign of weakness.	Okay, if he comes at you, just try and roll out the door.	A very sterile-looking glass shelf with several "blank" pieces of modern art.
Of course I will.	Then, would you stay... and watch the game with me? Maybe have a slice of pizza?	It's not.	Well, actually, you have a point. I guess watching the game by yourself with a scotch isn't, really, the only way to watch a game, huh. I don't know. I just, I've always thought of needing people as a sign of weakness.
Yeah... he's new here.	This is a strange resort, man. I mean, this wheelchair service is great, but that suite I rented... there's another person in it. And for some reason, the bellhop gave me an enema.	...Acceptance that some things are gonna be what they're gonna be.	What baby?
You know it all, man.	So... anything you wanna say?	Yeah... he's new here.	This is a strange resort, man. I mean, this wheelchair service is great, but that suite I rented... there's another person in it. And for some reason, the bellhop gave me an enema.
Nope.	Say anything else to him?	Still, I hated Will a little.......'Cause, thanks to him, I started to look at all the people who were important to me in terms of what will probably kill them.Heart Disease...Liver disease...Somebody choking her...I dunno... Probably stress.	You know it all, man.
Yeah, but you told me not	But you wanted to.	Nope.	Say anything else to him?
Oh, baby, I don't play by the rules.	You better. And don't do the whole two-day waiting thing.	Oh, yeah, me too. So... can I page you?	Well, I had a great time tonight.
Wait a second, is she joking? 'Cause if she's joking and I kiss her...Of course, if she's not joking...	Well, uh, goodnight....	Oh, baby, I don't play by the rules.	You better. And don't do the whole two-day waiting thing.
Yes!	Come on, I don't do this for all the doctors.	Wait a second, is she joking? 'Cause if she's joking and I kiss her...Of course, if she's not joking...	Well, uh, goodnight....
That's what... we used to tear it up...We should probably never do that again.	And that would come before Part B...	We should go out and celebrate, you know, tear it up like we used to do; just the two of us.	Yeah, it was cool; it was cool.Dude, I got to close for the first time, ever. Ever! The human body is so disgusting!Oh, not yours. Yours is stunning!
Whatever, I don't care.	Dude, you won't even know she's here. Well, except, she laughs at stupid stuff sometimes, and that kinda makes me laugh It's stup because it's so stupiOh, come on, tonight's still about us.	Maybe next time, her mom could come.	I'm so lucky I found you.
Yeah, I do.Sure	You really feel that way?	Well, we always look out for each other.... I guess I just don't feel like you have my back anymore.	What's goin' on with you, man?
I've never seen that before.	'Kay, uh... Excuse me, sorry; has anyone seen my keys? No? Okay, how about my wallet? Anyone?	Noo. No. I know the guy that closed, he'd never be that careless.	I've seen this before. Gauze, sponges some young surgeon left something in this man.
Suddenly, I was so fed up, I decided to teach Turk and Todd a lesson right there on the court.......You know, once I warmed up a little.	Don't bring in the same weak-ass crap the last kid did!	And there it was, everything was more important than me now.	Let's play, let's play.
Okay, I was looking at Bidwell...	J.D., I'ma show you what the deal's oh, oh, oh, ohh...All right, that's game. What's so important?	Suddenly, I was so fed up, I decided to teach Turk and Todd a lesson right there on the court.......You know, once I warmed up a little.	Don't bring in the same weak-ass crap the last kid did!
Okay.... Have you seen Turk?	Um... no, it hasn't come back yet.	Have you seen Mr. Bidwell's blood work?	"....Oh, baby refrain from breaking my heart. I'm so in love with "
Well, I'm sure you'll end up seeing him before I do, so....	Not since this morning.	Okay.... Have you seen Turk?	Um... no, it hasn't come back yet.
What if I am?	Bambi? Are you giving me attitude?	Well, I'm sure you'll end up seeing him before I do, so....	Not since this morning.
Okay, I'm gonna leave now.	Sweetie, you have to be a minority sidekick in a bad movie to pull that off. You know what I'm talking about, right?Explain it to this man, please.First, you do the head, then you do the finger, then you talk through the nose......And then you give a lot of attitude. That's how it works. But if you're not from there, you don't understand, so I'm not gonna even 'axe' you	What if I am?	Bambi? Are you giving me attitude?
No, no, I'm not even sure there is a problem. I'm running tests, I'm doing everything that I should be doing.	...Maimed, mutilated, disfigured.... Let's not split hairs.	No, no; no one killed anyone.	Someone else did!
Why am I protecting Turk when he can't even give me five seconds of his time?	Look, if you know about something, by not reporting it you're every bit as culpable. Now, is there anything that you'd like to tell me?	No, no, I'm not even sure there is a problem. I'm running tests, I'm doing everything that I should be doing.	...Maimed, mutilated, disfigured.... Let's not split hairs.
Tell him.	Anything at all?	Why am I protecting Turk when he can't even give me five seconds of his time?	Look, if you know about something, by not reporting it you're every bit as culpable. Now, is there anything that you'd like to tell me?
What happened?	Hi!	Negative? How could they be negative? The guy looks like death.	Oh, and the blood-work came back.
Oh, that's funny, because the only person who coulda given him insulin...	There's no infection. He's diabetic; so when someone gave him insulin during post-op, when he wasn't eating, he became hypoglycemic.	What happened?	Hi!
Me!I gave him insulin!	Uh-oh.	Oh, that's funny, because the only person who coulda given him insulin...	There's no infection. He's diabetic; so when someone gave him insulin during post-op, when he wasn't eating, he became hypoglycemic.
Twice!	Me!I gave him insulin!	Uh-oh.	Oh, that's funny, because the only person who coulda given him insulin...
Thank you so much. You totally saved my ass.	Well, he's fine, Bambi. I gave him an amp? of D-50 and he's eating, now. But you should probably give him a glass of orange juice in about an hour.	Twice!	Me!I gave him insulin!
Look, Turk....	Well, it wasn't me....	Thank you so much. You totally saved my ass.	Well, he's fine, Bambi. I gave him an amp? of D-50 and he's eating, now. But you should probably give him a glass of orange juice in about an hour.
I know.	Come on, man; you know I always got your back.	Look, Turk....	Well, it wasn't me....
I miss you so much it hurts, sometimes.	Just tell him how you feel without sounding like a girl, for once.	I know.	Come on, man; you know I always got your back.
Thank you.	Okay, um, you've had a rough day, so I'm gonna let that go for now.	I miss you so much it hurts, sometimes.	Just tell him how you feel without sounding like a girl, for once.
Oh, crap!	Look, we're gonna find time to hang, man. It's just that we're both really swamped right now, and I'm hanging out with Carla a lot, I know... But tell me, if there was someone you were into, you wouldn't be doing the same thing.	Thank you.	Okay, um, you've had a rough day, so I'm gonna let that go for now.
Well, we can wait like, three, four seconds.	What? Right now?	You're right. Kiss me.	You don't even want to hear about the day I've had.
Not gross, pretty. Come here.	No, I just ate, I feel gross.	Well, we can wait like, three, four seconds.	What? Right now?
It never fails.	J.D., can we just... talk for a second?	Not gross, pretty. Come here.	No, I just ate, I feel gross.
I use it all the time.Come on.	The first few weeks here have been so hard for me, mentally, physically, emotionally. It's like math camp all over again. Not that I've ever been to math camp it's just an expression.	Thank you.	Pretzel?
...Besides, I challenge anyone to survive as an intern without a close group of friends to lean on.	Turk and J.D.'s Apartment.	I know the idea of choosing friendship over sex is the last thing any guy wants to hear. But you know what? This time, it actually made sense to me.	I use it all the time.Come on.
You're a bad person.	Yeah, I know.... I miss it so much, it hurts sometimes.	I cant believe you lost our bottle opener.	...Besides, I challenge anyone to survive as an intern without a close group of friends to lean on.
Come on, Carla's your girlfriend, Elliot's my friend....	No.... We really don't.	We've got to do something about this.	Of course you meant something by it.
That'd be nice.	Honesty.... Well, I like that. You probably want these people to wait outside.	It's kinda too soon to tell.	Now that's enough! Now, sure, he's young, but he's probably a very good doctor. Are you a good doctor?
Uhh... would you guys mind....	Make 'em know you're a man, not a boy.	That'd be nice.	Honesty.... Well, I like that. You probably want these people to wait outside.
Right... that's what I'm talkin' about.	Well, that was manly!	Everybody outta here, now!"Now!"	Do it.
Yes, please!	Want a hard candy?	Right... that's what I'm talkin' about.	Well, that was manly!
You're using that "somebody called" joke a lot.	Dude, the League of Women Voters called and they want to know where to send your membership info.	I feel like you're missing out. Like, this Mrs. Tanner, she's got this...incredible energy and...and warmth.	Surgeons generally don't like to get too close to patients. Maybe it makes it harder to cut someone open... maybe it's just too risky... I dunno.
What's his name?	I know, I can't help it. I got a hernia patient to take care of.	You're using that "somebody called" joke a lot.	Dude, the League of Women Voters called and they want to know where to send your membership info.
He must feel so safe and taken care of.	Well, his name is Hernia Patient, but we've gotten close so I like to call him "Hernia".	What's his name?	I know, I can't help it. I got a hernia patient to take care of.
Yeah... I ordered them.	We'll put her on diuretics.	Why?	Nobody likes a brown-nose, son. Let me see the chart.
What's that?	These labs don't look good; I think it's time she got started on dialysis.Oh, but you know what you should do first, kiddo?	Yeah... I ordered them.	We'll put her on diuretics.
Couldn't you have got her a big cake?	Look, it's Samantha's fifth birthday. Now you're not gonna make me miss this, are you?	Oh, my God, are those s'mores?	I don't care about food right now!
How 'bout this?	Umm... Nope.	How about the ability to make quick decisions?	Nope.
Thank you. Come on, let's go.	You're very cute.	Okay, enough of this. I don't think any of you realize how serious this is. Right now we need to be worried about your mother, your grandmother... your....I'm sorry, we we haven't met, I'm Dr. Dorian.	No!

Speaking of which, I took the liberty of jotting down a few things I think everybody should do at least once in their life.	It didn't come up. Look, they don't need that burden; besides, they'd just give me a bunch of reasons to change my mind.	You didn't tell them, did you.	She's telling her family.

You're right.	Almost one. You know what, Cox doesn't need your help taking her down for a TIPS procedure. As a matter of fact, he shouldn't even be putting you in that situation!	How many has she had?	I have magic breasts.

It felt good.	Well, geez, Agnes, does the field hockey team know that you're missing?	I'll always remember that moment as the first "thank you" I got from Dr. Cox.	Look, I don't think you realize how important you are to some people around here.

It felt weird trying to push Nick on her. I mean, this morning I wanted to kill the guy; but the truth is, he's so nice, he probably would've helped me.	Did he look back, did he like me?

Look, this is so unfair, you're supposed to do my evaluation not me. And, you know what? You're gonna do it, buddy-boy.	And that's when I realized, I'm not gonna let people take advantage of me anymore.	Come on, it's different this time. Now it's both of us.You can still see my hand on your shoulder.	Twice?Ohh? Ohh!
I'm serious.	"Buddy-boy"? Why...I...oughtta....	Look, this is so unfair, you're supposed to do my evaluation not me. And, you know what? You're gonna do it, buddy-boy.	And that's when I realized, I'm not gonna let people take advantage of me anymore.
Well, if it's that easy, then it won't take you that long to do it.	Relax, Newbie. It's just an evaluation; it should be easy.	I'm serious.	"Buddy-boy"? Why...I...oughtta....
When?	All right, well, don't you worry about it another minute, there, Newbie. I'll evaluate you, I'll evaluate the hell right outta ya.	Well, if it's that easy, then it won't take you that long to do it.	Relax, Newbie. It's just an evaluation; it should be easy.
Fine!	Oh, just the second I get off work.	When?	All right, well, don't you worry about it another minute, there, Newbie. I'll evaluate you, I'll evaluate the hell right outta ya.
Great!	Fine!	Fine!	Oh, just the second I get off work.
Here it is.You get off, like, six-ish, er...?	Great!	Great!	Fine!
I love you, man.	It's okay; your intentions were good, and there's never been an issue of race between us. Since the day I met you, you've been nothing but a friend to me.	Hey, Turk. Look, I'm really sorry about the whole poster thing. It was racially insensitive of me; I should have been more aware of your feelings before I went ahead and spoke for you.	You're such a guy. You can't even begin to understand something this deep on any kind of real emotional level.
Keep it real!	Hit me one.	I love you, man.	It's okay; your intentions were good, and there's never been an issue of race between us. Since the day I met you, you've been nothing but a friend to me.
Of course, in my case, I knew exactly where I stood. And it didn't feel that good.	Hell yeah!	...Like, when you're searching for a place to fit in, and you don't even realize you've been there the whole time.Or how a bunch of posters can't turn you into a role model if you've already been one for years.	Anytime.
Mmm Jennifer.	J.D., I know. He won't stop talking about you. I'm Jennifer.	How's it goin I'm-	First of all I already told her I got a girlfriend. Second you just put your bare lips on my ear.
I know two things about bars, one they're always packed the week of Thanksgiving and two put a beer in my hand and I'm Mr. Smooth.	It's on, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on!	I do what I can.	Tell the nice lady.
Well, I once tripped over an I.V. and blood shot over everyone! Er uh a little got on my nose… Every damn day saving those children!	I was laughing so hard milk was coming out of my nose.	I know two things about bars, one they're always packed the week of Thanksgiving and two put a beer in my hand and I'm Mr. Smooth.	It's on, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on!
Right.	Who wants margaritas? Dude, less blood more fruity drinks.	Well, I once tripped over an I.V. and blood shot over everyone! Er uh a little got on my nose… Every damn day saving those children!	I was laughing so hard milk was coming out of my nose.
Why do you say that?	Dude, this girl's pretty hot, so try not to blow it. Okay?	That's the thing about Turk he hasn't changed a bit since college. He's still the same goofball who tells me how to be cooler.	Right.
That sounds like a Fat Albert joke.Don't worry about it man I feel good tonight, you know what I'm saying?. Except for this stabbing pain in my side.	Because you're like a 24 hour convenience store. You never close.	Why do you say that?	Dude, this girl's pretty hot, so try not to blow it. Okay?
Dude!	So he was up all night with a high fever, cramping and crying.	That sounds like a Fat Albert joke.Don't worry about it man I feel good tonight, you know what I'm saying?. Except for this stabbing pain in my side.	Because you're like a 24 hour convenience store. You never close.
You're a good friend.	You know people die here?	On the bright side it'll be interesting to see what it feels like to be a patient here.	Poor Bambi. Don't worry Carla will take care of you. Make sure he gets admitted right away.
Whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah. You're examining me? I don't want you to see my unmentionables.	Alright, showtime. Clear out so I can check em out.	Not right away.	Eh! Eck!
Actually I use the word unmentionables for my genitals as well.	I've seen underwear before.	Whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah. You're examining me? I don't want you to see my unmentionables.	Alright, showtime. Clear out so I can check em out.
Oh it's active.	Oh, you're making this so much easier! Are you sexually active?	No, no, is it a problem if it whistles?	Shortness of breath, dizziness, problems urinating?
Cold hands.	I'll write, rare dry spell in the margin. Okay time for the physical	Oh it's active.	Oh, you're making this so much easier! Are you sexually active?
I'm still puking every hour and my fever's pretty high but you're sure it's okay for me to be out of bed right?	See that wasn't so bad. All done.	Ow!	Elliot's exam was frighteningly reminiscent of when my older brother used to beat the crap out of me.
What annoying thing?	I don't know Dr. Benson was kind of my mentor, so don't do that annoying thing.	I'm still puking every hour and my fever's pretty high but you're sure it's okay for me to be out of bed right?	See that wasn't so bad. All done.
Come on that's a little-	You know when you talk.	What annoying thing?	I don't know Dr. Benson was kind of my mentor, so don't do that annoying thing.
He can say what he wants. The bottom line is he's showing me off.Watching Dr. Cox I realized we never really stop craving the attention of people we look up to.	See there it is. How does that not drive you crazy?I know you're all excited because got the gown on but under no circumstance are you to curtsy.	Come on that's a little-	You know when you talk.
He seemed nice.	Any questions? Great.	He can say what he wants. The bottom line is he's showing me off.Watching Dr. Cox I realized we never really stop craving the attention of people we look up to.	See there it is. How does that not drive you crazy?I know you're all excited because got the gown on but under no circumstance are you to curtsy.
You know I'm hearing it now it is kind of annoying when I talk.	Careful newbie.	He seemed nice.	Any questions? Great.
Dude she violated me.	So Elliot's uh exam was that bad ay?	I guess in a lot of relationships you regress to the person you were when you first met.	You know I'm hearing it now it is kind of annoying when I talk.
So there it is a classic trap. Two choices, either wuss out or tell the truth.	Was there something wrong with my exam?	Not everyone, just the people that work here. Oh and my parents.	I heard you're telling everyone I violated you.
Yeah, those too. I just think you know you could be more comforting.	Mm hm you mean my hands?	Well, you're kinda rough, yeah you're rough. And you're a little business like. Oh and you're cold.	So there it is a classic trap. Two choices, either wuss out or tell the truth.
Maybe not.	Do you know how annoying you are when you talk?	I could tell she appreciated how hard it was for me to say that.	Yeah, those too. I just think you know you could be more comforting.
I do cardio.	Still Rodin's masterpiece makes us wonder, why didn't he spend a little less time thinking and a little more time at the gym?	I guess I never realized how hard rounds are on the patient. It feels like you're on display.	Well, I haven't had my coffee yet so I'm finding it hard coming up with a more colorful way to say who gives a crap? Actually that wasn't half bad.Our next patient is a twenty-six year old male who has presented vomiting, abdominal cramps, and fever.
Do they celebrate Thanksgiving in your homeland?	Not really.	I can't believe I have to spend all Thanksgiving here. Tell me that wouldn't kill you.	You better watch it Bambi you don't want a hundred pound white girl mad at you. You'll flinch every time you hear a range rover.
You have a Chicago? Be nice to me, I'm getting surgery.	You mean Chicago?	Do they celebrate Thanksgiving in your homeland?	Not really.
Yeah but who's the intern who's gonna do all the work?	Dr. Wen's the attending.	You have a Chicago? Be nice to me, I'm getting surgery.	You mean Chicago?
Oh good God	I get to cut you open. I get to cut you open. I get to cut you open. I get to cut you open. I get to cut you open. Uh ooh ooh. Go girl, uh uh go get it. Uh uh and go uh and down and down. Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh.	Yeah but who's the intern who's gonna do all the work?	Dr. Wen's the attending.
Sir I'd prefer it if someone other than Dr. Turk performed the surgery.	Dude! I'm about to bust a mad slizzice in your insides!	After all he's a highly trained competent young doctor.	Mark for the incision right about here.
The best thing about good friends is how quickly things like this blow over.	Fair enough. Dr. Kotter will perform the procedure tomorrow morning.	Sir I'd prefer it if someone other than Dr. Turk performed the surgery.	Dude! I'm about to bust a mad slizzice in your insides!
You want some salsa for that chip on your shoulder?	Whatever man.	You understand right?	The best thing about good friends is how quickly things like this blow over.
What do you mean like school in July?	I can't believe you, I would never ever do something like this to you. You're like school in July.	You want some salsa for that chip on your shoulder?	Whatever man.
Most doctors don't believe in the whole out of body experience thing. And I don't know if it was real or a dream but I swear I was up there watching Turk operate on me and I have to say, he's an amazing surgeon.	Dr. Turk let's get started.	Who's on call tonight?	Bambi your fever's spiking. They're worried that your appendix might burst. So we're going into surgery now.
No seriously man, I want you to know if I ever need surgery again I want you inside of me.	It's okay man.	Turk I was an idiot	Hey, I just need to check on your incision.
Dude she rocks.	I wanna be the one inside you.Look J.D. I get it. I mean to me you'll always be that geeky kid with the Pat Benatar T-Shirt on.	No seriously man, I want you to know if I ever need surgery again I want you inside of me.	It's okay man.
Ooh!	I just want you to know how serious I am about what I do.That's not important. You know it's still Thanksgiving for like 20 more minutes.Now you can have ginger ale and a cracker.	Dude she rocks.	I wanna be the one inside you.Look J.D. I get it. I mean to me you'll always be that geeky kid with the Pat Benatar T-Shirt on.
Get those pennies away from me!	Oh and I forgot, you're change… two pennies.	Ooh!	I just want you to know how serious I am about what I do.That's not important. You know it's still Thanksgiving for like 20 more minutes.Now you can have ginger ale and a cracker.
I guess what they say is true the people you work with really do become your family. Like your brother, and your sister in law, or that cousin you have funny feelings for,. and the crazy angry uncle everyone sort of hopes isn't coming this year.	Happy Thanksgiving man.	Get those pennies away from me!	Oh and I forgot, you're change… two pennies.
Ah uncomfortable silences and alcohol… just like Thanksgiving at home.	Nobody talk, just drink.	I guess what they say is true the people you work with really do become your family. Like your brother, and your sister in law, or that cousin you have funny feelings for,. and the crazy angry uncle everyone sort of hopes isn't coming this year.	Happy Thanksgiving man.
Their was the Nina…	Drink!	Ah uncomfortable silences and alcohol… just like Thanksgiving at home.	Nobody talk, just drink.
Yeah; I'm okay with it.	You realize you're annoying me?	Yeah, see, there ya go.So, what are you doin'?	Fascinating.
It's just a bench.	J.D., I've had such a crappy morning in this hell-hole that I decided to come out here and eat my lunch. This spot feels secluded I mean, it's so peaceful. I feel like I'm getting my spirit back.	Yeah; I'm okay with it.	You realize you're annoying me?
Nice. You know, I've already eaten, but I suppose I could	Sit down, sweet thing. Sit down.	It's just a bench.	J.D., I've had such a crappy morning in this hell-hole that I decided to come out here and eat my lunch. This spot feels secluded I mean, it's so peaceful. I feel like I'm getting my spirit back.
Your cupcake.This is how I get _my_ spirit back.Mmm-mmm! ...I feel _alive_ again! I feel alive again! Alive again! I feel alive....!	Okay, what's it gonna take for you to leave this second?	Nice. You know, I've already eaten, but I suppose I could	Sit down, sweet thing. Sit down.
Morning.	Okay. You know what? It's time to change this pattern.	Your cupcake.This is how I get _my_ spirit back.Mmm-mmm! ...I feel _alive_ again! I feel alive again! Alive again! I feel alive....!	Okay, what's it gonna take for you to leave this second?
Just doing a little drilling, huh?	How do you figure?	Morning.	Okay. You know what? It's time to change this pattern.
Look, I have an idea: Let's try and go the whole day without getting in each other's hair; you know, just...give each other a break...? What do you say?	Yeah.	Just doing a little drilling, huh?	How do you figure?
That that's good, but you know, I already I have a nickname; it's...it's "J.D."	I'm gonna give you a nickname.	Look, I have an idea: Let's try and go the whole day without getting in each other's hair; you know, just...give each other a break...? What do you say?	Yeah.
You see, when you start out, the nurses know more than you. But after a few months, the training kicks in and you both feel the dynamic shift.	His O-2 set's dropping; I think he just needs respiratory treatment.	It's hard for doctors and nurses to be long-term friends....	Do you ever stop giving?
The future of the relationship depends on how she handles that very moment.	Uhhhh...actually, Carla, I think, because of the congestive heart failure, he just needs Lasix.	You see, when you start out, the nurses know more than you. But after a few months, the training kicks in and you both feel the dynamic shift.	His O-2 set's dropping; I think he just needs respiratory treatment.
Okay, how 'bout a little of this.	What up, Raj!	Hey-hey-hey what's happenin', Rerun.	I know.
Take it back.	Oh, come on, it wasn't even that good a show.	Okay, how 'bout a little of this.	What up, Raj!
Are we still on for that, uh, Bresson exhibit?	This second.Ooh, look at the time! Gotta go it's lunch-time! See you, Baby!	Take it back.	Oh, come on, it wasn't even that good a show.
Baby, photography is for studs.	Hey, thanks again for the invite, Bambi; I love photography.	You big jerk.	Oh. Now I see.
Yes.	Did you do your pre-rounds?	After working at a hospital for a while, you develop a sixth sense for danger.Maybe there's a mass cas. alert...maybe there's a code.......Maybe someone spent the morning with the most annoying patient in the world and needs to vent.Luckily, I was prepared.	Baby, photography is for studs.
Yes.	Discharge summaries?	Yes.	Did you do your pre-rounds?
Yes!	Pharmacy renewals?	Yes.	Discharge summaries?
Yes.	S.O.A.P. notes?	Yes!	Pharmacy renewals?
Yes.	Central line changes.	Yes.	S.O.A.P. notes?
...Yes.	Okay, Janet. But...did you go ahead and fix your beeper so it doesn't play that annoying song every single time you get paged?	Yes.	Central line changes.
Is that all you got!?!Good one!	I expect you to act like a professional around here!	Crap.	...Yes.
Yeah; you know what really pisses me off? Is that no one ever calls him on anything, you know?	So Cox tore into you, huh?	Pain.	Ahh, he earned it.
It's not fair. Wait, why are you eating in here?	You wanna kick and scream while you're teaching people here, that's fine. But if you _ever_ yell at my friend again over _nothing_, then I will personally wipe that scary smile off your face, put it in my purse, and keep it there until no one around here is any more scared of you than I am.	Yeah; you know what really pisses me off? Is that no one ever calls him on anything, you know?	So Cox tore into you, huh?
Oh, no.	It is!	You know, Todd, I'm not sure, but I'm I'm gonna guess that it's your penis.	Dude. You know what else stands up for itself?
'Scuse me?	Sure. Oh, and Ginger, by the way, just a real smooth move running to your mommy.	Actually, sir, it's "who, who", but thank you! That that's great.	No-no, no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no, no, NO! There's no time for 'yeah...but's. I want her punted outta here in the next five minutes or you will personally be responsible for covering every missed shift during this year's flu season. Now go. Now go. Now go.Hey, you.For what it's worth, I don't care if your beeper plays "Who let the dogs out woof, woof" as many times as ya like.
In those cases, you have to make sure that your emotions don't get the best of you.	It's so on.	To tell you the truth, most of these choices actually have nothing to do with medicine.	Well, actually, I I came down here to tell you that, uh, we're gonna keep you here for the weekend just to get some rest.
Good choice.	Yes, Doctor.	Look, my name is not Bambi! Okay!? It's Dr. Dorian. And I don't I don't really need to be looked after, okay?! So loo how about I'll be the doctor, and you just...you be the nurse!	Give me that, Bambi! That's not a toy!
Ugh!	It's Scooter!	She called me "Bambi" in front of everyone. My name is not Bambi!	What did you do?
I think I've said all I can.	Sweetie, I know you would take it back if you could; I do! We're okay, right?	Well, actually, I	I should have realized you can stand up for yourself.
Wait! You just accepted my apology. You can't take it back!	Yeah, you know what? Hold it! I don't think we're okay.	What? No, no, that's just it's just a joke. I'm doing the whole, like, "Turn that frown upside-down...."	What, is that supposed to make me feel better or something?
Look, Carla, if it's a problem, then you, me, and Elliot and Turk, we'll get together and	I've had hundreds of interns decide that they don't need me anymore. Why should You see, this is why you can't be friends with doctors.	Oh, thank goodness; 'cause I thought you were mad at me.	You know I was only gonna go to that stupid exhibit because I wanted you to think I was brainy or something. I'm so angry at myself.
Carla, I do not think	I don't work with Turk! And I'm not that close to Elliot. The only problem here is _you_, okay? We're supposed to be friends. Your self-esteem is so wrapped up in what you do. You're a doctor that's all you are, that's how you define yourself. And you think that you're better than me because of it.	Look, Carla, if it's a problem, then you, me, and Elliot and Turk, we'll get together and	I've had hundreds of interns decide that they don't need me anymore. Why should You see, this is why you can't be friends with doctors.
Okay, sometimes that's true.Carla, you're a good nurse.	Admit it. Admit it right now, or I'll never respect you again.	Carla, I do not think	I don't work with Turk! And I'm not that close to Elliot. The only problem here is _you_, okay? We're supposed to be friends. Your self-esteem is so wrapped up in what you do. You're a doctor that's all you are, that's how you define yourself. And you think that you're better than me because of it.
Please wait.	I'm a _great_ nurse; you patronizing ass.You don't even get it, do you? For nine years, I never once felt bad about myself for what I do not for one second. And then I met you.	Okay, sometimes that's true.Carla, you're a good nurse.	Admit it. Admit it right now, or I'll never respect you again.
Or you'll learn from it.If you don't like what you see, I guess all you can do is hope that you haven't burned too many bridges.	Impressive.	Sometimes the only way to take a really good look at yourself is through someone else's eyes. If you're lucky, you'll like what you see.	Hey.
From that moment on, I knew I'd be "Bambi" forever.	You know the answer to that; don't do that. But thanks, Bambi.	Hey, Carla, how many M.A.Q.s of potassium should I give this guy?	Or you'll learn from it.If you don't like what you see, I guess all you can do is hope that you haven't burned too many bridges.
He's actually very talented.	See you tomorrow, Scooter.	From that moment on, I knew I'd be "Bambi" forever.	You know the answer to that; don't do that. But thanks, Bambi.
But I've only worked here for three months.	I did. I drove around the whole city before my 5 a.m. shift just...looking for that trying to add a little cheer. You will not ruin my Christmas. Not again. Not this year.	Oh , this thing?Who put this up!?	Ohh, I don't know, but I'm guessing it's about hmm 9:15ish?
I hate him.....but not as much as moments like these. There's nothing I can do for that guy, and yet, when I go in there, the whole family's gonna look at me like I got some magical power to fix him.	Hey, Randy, Jackie, whatta ya say? This is the monkey I got to videotape the birth.	Huh!	Wow. I guess that means he respects me a little.
Heyyy.I'm sorry, but it's been two weeks and your son shows no neurological improvement.	Hey, everybody!	I hate him.....but not as much as moments like these. There's nothing I can do for that guy, and yet, when I go in there, the whole family's gonna look at me like I got some magical power to fix him.	Hey, Randy, Jackie, whatta ya say? This is the monkey I got to videotape the birth.
Oh, you're ridiculous.	It was a miracle! First of all, the man was damn-near dead; then he comes out!	Heyyy.I'm sorry, but it's been two weeks and your son shows no neurological improvement.	Hey, everybody!
It was not a miracle!	He was damn-near J.D., I'm telling you, it was a miracle!	Oh, you're ridiculous.	It was a miracle! First of all, the man was damn-near dead; then he comes out!
I kind of envy Turk to be that sure of something, to have that faith of course, that doesn't mean I don't love busting him about it.	Yes it _was_ a miracle! Dude!	It was not a miracle!	He was damn-near J.D., I'm telling you, it was a miracle!
That's fine; we all have our beliefs. I, for instance, carry around this tiny little Monopoly piece for good luck.	Mm-hmm!	Okay; so you think _God_ was responsible for his recovery?	I kind of envy Turk to be that sure of something, to have that faith of course, that doesn't mean I don't love busting him about it.
Still, no matter what the realities, the end result is always the same.	You do it.	You'll fart, pee, puke, and poop in front of ten complete strangers who'll be staring intently at your vagina which, by the way, has an eighty percent chance of tearing!	Congratulations! You're expecting! Don't worry your doctor will tell you everything you need to know.Hi, Doctor!
At least I can go home now.	Don't kid yourself, Newbie I couldn't _be_any madder at you!Oh! Ah! Do _not_ do that again! That's a bad newbie! Oh, bad! Oh, bad!Bad!Ah! Oh! Oh! Oh! Bad newbie!	You know, if he was really mad at me, he would've stayed and yelled at me.	Well, I was there; you know, I could certainly jot down some of my feelings and...impressions.
I can't believe I'm wearing a suit at 6:30 in the morning.	You see, maybe it's because Christmas is a hard time for people, maybe it's because too many families get together, but, statistically, Christmas Eve it's one of the worst nights of the year to be on-call.	At least I can go home now.	Don't kid yourself, Newbie I couldn't _be_any madder at you!Oh! Ah! Do _not_ do that again! That's a bad newbie! Oh, bad! Oh, bad!Bad!Ah! Oh! Oh! Oh! Bad newbie!
Noted.	If you ruin this for Turk, I'll have to hurt you.	I can't believe I'm wearing a suit at 6:30 in the morning.	You see, maybe it's because Christmas is a hard time for people, maybe it's because too many families get together, but, statistically, Christmas Eve it's one of the worst nights of the year to be on-call.
Excuse me?	You made some interesting choices with the camera, Orson you didn't want to see any faces?	I never really thought of faith as important; but without his, I don't know, Turk kinda seems like he's fading away.Me, I could use a little faith. I have to tell the Wheelers I didn't tape a thing.	Yeah, that's exactly what's gonna happen: She'll definitely turn up, she'll have a healthy baby, and nothing'll ever happen to either one of 'em.
Shaved it....	You shaved the baby?	We shaved the baby.	Yeah, well....
Yep; definitely. Shave and a hair-cut...two bits.	Well, it's standard procedure, what with the recent outbreak of pre-natal lice.	Shaved it....	You shaved the baby?
And then something amazing happened they connected. And all the hatred they had for each other was suddenly focused on me!	Plus, he didn't even go see Baby Charlie yet.	Maybe Dr. Cox has pushed me too far, I don't know; whatever it was, I told on him.	Oh, I've seen 'em; they're real. And they're gross.
Babies are amazing. Especially the way they bring people together.	You're okay, okay? You're gonna be okay.	One of the worst things about this place is how often you feel like there's no one to turn to.	I talked to a 9-1-1 operator who got a call from this young girl who was in labor, but they lost the signal. I don't know what to do.
Because a baby can stir something deep down inside you you didn't even know was there.	What up, little dawg!	I really think it's impossible to be unaffected.	Thanks.
They can help you find something you thought you'd lost.	Aw! Look at the baby!	Because a baby can stir something deep down inside you you didn't even know was there.	What up, little dawg!
God bless us, every one.	Merry Christmas, guys.	So, I guess Turk was right after all: Miracles do happen.I think you just have to be willing to look for them.	I don't know I just knew!
You really do have to keep an eye on things around here, 'cause just when it seems like everything's going great.......that's when the tiniest thing can throw it all out of whack.	No, I didn't! But but, please, keep talking!	I'm your wing man, Maverick!I was watching, uh, 'Top Gun'. Did you know that Goose is actually the guy from 'E.R.'?	Go down to Bed 18 and get me his tox-screen; and you better cross your fingers that the news is good, because if it's not I'm blaming you.And Newbie: I want you to start a drain on the purulent pericarditis in Bed 23 now that's a tricky bastard, he's tried to die five times on me already today. Keep an eye on him.
Nice to meet you.	Alex Hanson.	Hello!How are ya, I'm Dr. Dorian.	By the way, this is a special phone if you don't answer it, you get to be the intern who does the physicals over at the state prison!
Hellooo.	Ooh, a firm handshake. I like that.	Nice to meet you.	Alex Hanson.
Oh, so you can do movies and I can't.	It puts the lotion on the skin.	Excuse me.	Not you. Ginger, get the lead out! Come on.
Well, stuck is such a literal term. It's more like, not moving.	Oh, my God! Is it stuck!?	Not that good a sound.	Was that a good sound?!
I can't; you were knocked unconscious, you could have a serious head injury. Just be glad you're not claustrophobic.	Well, pull me the hell out of here!	Well, stuck is such a literal term. It's more like, not moving.	Oh, my God! Is it stuck!?
I promise.Dr. Cox must have my pager on speed dial. He's completely on top of me today.	Promise you won't leave me.	I can't; you were knocked unconscious, you could have a serious head injury. Just be glad you're not claustrophobic.	Well, pull me the hell out of here!
That's naughty!	Oh, do you know how much I wish Dr. Cox was on top of me?	I promise.Dr. Cox must have my pager on speed dial. He's completely on top of me today.	Promise you won't leave me.
Oh, come on, you're over-reacting a little bit.	You make me so mad, I might actually scream! Every day you bitch and you bitch about how hard Dr. Cox is on you, and you don't even realize that you're his go-to guy.	That's naughty!	Oh, do you know how much I wish Dr. Cox was on top of me?
Ummm.... He had me intubate and extubate Mrs. Pollard; float a Swan on Mr. Caulca; and then do two thoracenteses, a paracentesis, a radial art. line...oh, and then place a transvenous pacemaker for a complete heart-block. Why? What did you do?	What has he had you do today? Hm?	Oh, come on, you're over-reacting a little bit.	You make me so mad, I might actually scream! Every day you bitch and you bitch about how hard Dr. Cox is on you, and you don't even realize that you're his go-to guy.
He takes it sugar, no cream.	Oh, uh....Cream. No sugar.	Ummm.... He had me intubate and extubate Mrs. Pollard; float a Swan on Mr. Caulca; and then do two thoracenteses, a paracentesis, a radial art. line...oh, and then place a transvenous pacemaker for a complete heart-block. Why? What did you do?	What has he had you do today? Hm?
Why are you squeezing all my fingers?	Why am I always in your fantasies!? You got a problem, man!	Whoa.... It really feels like there's something going on, here. I wonder what she looks like?	You're such a nice guy.
I am so in.I'm right back out.	I'll tell you what I'm not doing: I'm not checking for a wedding ring....	Why are you squeezing all my fingers?	Why am I always in your fantasies!? You got a problem, man!
We all have important things to do.	No time!	Hey, Elliot, do you	Wow!
Ohh.... Come on, just tell me, does she look anything like Jimmie Walker?	Yeah, I do. But I ain't telling you.	So, do you know what she looks like?	You know what, that's exactly what's wrong with you men. You're all so superficial, so afraid of what you really feel. I'm so sick of it!
You know, you're not a bad guy if you wanna wait and see what she looks like.	Oh. So, what, uh, restaurant are you taking me to?	Uhh, Alex, he's gone.	It turns out I only have a mild concussion, and plus, I work here and that's
Ohhh....ohh....are you sure? 'Cause....okay.Ah! I gotta go. Sorry.	I'm kidding! You don't have to take me out to dinner.	You know, you're not a bad guy if you wanna wait and see what she looks like.	Oh. So, what, uh, restaurant are you taking me to?
I don't know...I just thought it'd be hot. Elliot, he's testing you. If you ever want Cox to respect you, you can't be afraid to disagree with him.	What does that have to do with anything?	Fine, why don't you just quit, become a lesbian, and hook up with some hot model?	It's like, I say one thing, he says the other. I seriously can't take it anymore.
But I still do it. Get back in the game, Elliot.	You're afraid.	I don't know...I just thought it'd be hot. Elliot, he's testing you. If you ever want Cox to respect you, you can't be afraid to disagree with him.	What does that have to do with anything?
Will you go out with me?	What the hell are you doing!?	Wait! Stop the machine!	...And how it's really just about overcoming your fears. Because the truth is, every time you take a big risk in your life, no matter how it ends up, you're always glad you took it.
It's iffy.	If I say no, will you still let me out of this thing?	Will you go out with me?	What the hell are you doing!?
So, say it.	Then I guess I have to say yes, don't I?	It's iffy.	If I say no, will you still let me out of this thing?
Huh.	Sure. I'd love to.	So, say it.	Then I guess I have to say yes, don't I?
Oh, it's Cox he wants me back at the hospital.	Nooo!	...Killed our first raccoon.Ever since then, every date we've been on has always ended the same way.	Look out!
Yeah, that's me.	But the page is addressed to Lillian.	Oh, it's Cox he wants me back at the hospital.	Nooo!
That was probably the wrong time to ask for a quickie.	What a drag....	Yeah, that's me.	But the page is addressed to Lillian.
Staring....	What are you doing?	Eating.	What am I doing right now?
Not really.	Okay.There. Now no one gets to eat it! Ya happy?	Staring....	What are you doing?
Hi!You know what's great about you working in the hospital?	Hey, you!	Not really.	Okay.There. Now no one gets to eat it! Ya happy?
Like, even when our dates get interrupted, we can just have a date here. Yeah, like, let's say for instance you wanted to watch a movie we could just go to the conference room and watch that video on S.T.D.s. It's funny, and it makes you think!	Hm?	Hi!You know what's great about you working in the hospital?	Hey, you!
Well, how does a date with you end?	Look, maybe it would be good if we actually had a date that...ends.	Like, even when our dates get interrupted, we can just have a date here. Yeah, like, let's say for instance you wanted to watch a movie we could just go to the conference room and watch that video on S.T.D.s. It's funny, and it makes you think!	Hm?
Tonight. Dinner. Hyde's.	It can range from a kiss at the door to...all I have for breakfast is yogurt, and I'm out of bowls, so you'll have to eat off my stomach.	Well, how does a date with you end?	Look, maybe it would be good if we actually had a date that...ends.
Hell, yeah.	Wow. I'd actually never thought of that.	Yes, Kuru.	Kuru.
I was not.	Were you aware that the only documented cases of Kuru were members of a cannibalistic tribe in eastern Papua New Guinea?	Hell, yeah.	Wow. I'd actually never thought of that.
Really?	Actually, Doc, I was in New Guinea just last week.	I was not.	Were you aware that the only documented cases of Kuru were members of a cannibalistic tribe in eastern Papua New Guinea?
Okay.	Cool. Cool.	Dude, I'm sorry I can't talk right now. I really gotta figure this Mr. Yeager thing out.	So, last night, when I was with Carla....
I got it!	Let's just say my horse didn't finish the race. I mean, I'm at the filling station but my credit card gets declined. I'm on the jet ski	Okay.	Cool. Cool.
No, no, no. Mr. Yeager!	Good, 'cause I had no idea what I was gonna say after that one.	I got it!	Let's just say my horse didn't finish the race. I mean, I'm at the filling station but my credit card gets declined. I'm on the jet ski
Not anymore.Not even the most horrible thing he could think of.	Booga-booga-booga-booga!!!	In fact, nothing he did seemed to scare us.	Win some, lose some.
I am so on top of things tonight, it's scary.	Fair enough. Let's go treat the patient.	Yeah, whatever. I'm with you.	Temporal Arteritis. Of course it is. Nurse?Will you start Mr. Yeager on high-dose Solumedrol and get the surgery resident he needs a temporal artery biopsy, stat.Now, Newbie, I'm relatively certain I can handle this. You're off anyway, aren't you?
She's not blind.	Aw, you mean the blind girl you've been dating?	Alex dumped me.	I-I think you're a really good guy, okay, but....
Well, I was just so excited about what we were doing here last night, I just forgot all about our date.	Of course she's not. Okay, Newbie, how'd you drop the ball on this one? And don't tell me you cried, or I'm gonna have you banned from the men's room again.	She's not blind.	Aw, you mean the blind girl you've been dating?
Well, you know what? That that means a lot coming from you, Mr. Right Here With Me Two Hours After His Shift, Also...And Last Monday Night, Too...Guy.	You didn't forget. You kept looking at your watch. I saw you.I just naturally assumed that you were just afraid of missing 'Judging Amy' it never occurred to me that you were choosing work over being with that sweet little biscuit, you stupid piss-ant.

...maybe he just hated rounds, I don't know.	How on earth are they ever going to learn anything....	Maybe he felt sorry for Kelso and didn't want to take away the one thing the guy had.	Get over here. Right now!
But if you didn't know Dr. Cox like I did, you'd have believed his performance, too.I guess the key to a lot of things is balance. Whether it's balance of power...	...ridiculous! Now get the hell out of my I.C.U! I'm taking over!	...maybe he just hated rounds, I don't know.	How on earth are they ever going to learn anything....
...balance in love......or sometimes just balance.For some of us, it seems too far out of reach......too difficult to achieve.....But the important thing is just to never stop trying......especially if you like girls named Alex...and chicken salad.	Dr. Simotas, stop smiling!I hate smiling.	But if you didn't know Dr. Cox like I did, you'd have believed his performance, too.I guess the key to a lot of things is balance. Whether it's balance of power...	...ridiculous! Now get the hell out of my I.C.U! I'm taking over!
How so?	I love old eggs.You are so different from the guys I usually go out with.	Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.	You taste like old eggs.
Yeah, well, that is because I respect you.	Well, for starters......I'm still wearing pants.	How so?	I love old eggs.You are so different from the guys I usually go out with.

Me neither.	Hey, thanks for being so patient with me. I hope you don't think I'm a big tease. I just...I love sleeping in the same bed with you. I've never slept better, you know?	Yeah. And also, this triple-knot, I couldn't get out.Argh!	Oh, yeah?
You know, in fact, I'll go ahead and say it: I hope we never have sex.	Mm.	Me neither.	Hey, thanks for being so patient with me. I hope you don't think I'm a big tease. I just...I love sleeping in the same bed with you. I've never slept better, you know?
Whatever....	What would you say...if I told you I feel ready right now.	You know, in fact, I'll go ahead and say it: I hope we never have sex.	Mm.
Yeah, tonight is good, but I think now also good.	Oh, okay, then I think tonight, we should get a nice bottle of wine	Whatever....	What would you say...if I told you I feel ready right now.
Yeah.	Really? Why not?Ahh. I get it.	Not today.	Whoa. No, please! Step on my foot! I'm just waiting for an excuse.
Thanks.	Nice pull.	Yeah.	Really? Why not?Ahh. I get it.
What? I I am not discussing that with you!	You slept with her yet?	Thanks.	Nice pull.
Listen, Jolly Green: people's personal lives are just that they're personal.	That's a no.	What? I I am not discussing that with you!	You slept with her yet?
I believe in Mr. Barnes.	Oh! The addict said he quit? Why wouldn't you tell me something like that? 'Cause, don't you see, that changes everything.	Yeah, but he said he quit.	Mr. Barnes has been admitted for substance abuse three times in the past year.
...Or, like, eighty minutes?	Hm?	Yes, please!Oh...hey.... Hey, Elliot...um...can you come back in, like, two minutes?	Would you like to change that?
What we should do is split up into teams and search every room. We'll take this one.	I just wanted to tell you the nurses just did a check of the narcotics drawer, and there's 50 Percocet missing.	...Or, like, eighty minutes?	Hm?
I just don't like it when you leave.	Hm? What?	Uh, Alex?	You know they're gonna go right to Mr. Barnes; I'm gonna go check on him, okay?
Alex.	The booty principle: Which one do you want to sleep with?	What's that?	Stick to the booty principle.
I'm not sure about Turk's advice; I mean, sometimes he oversimplifies things especially when it comes to booty.	Then I think _she_ might be right.	Alex.	The booty principle: Which one do you want to sleep with?
I agree with Alex. Yeah, I've been thinking about it a lot, and I think that, you know, she's right about Mr. Barnes we can't we can't just jump to conclusions.	What would you say if I told you I feel ready right...now.	I'm not sure about Turk's advice; I mean, sometimes he oversimplifies things especially when it comes to booty.	Then I think _she_ might be right.
Hey, tell me something: What do what do you think about Alex?	Oh, I am _so_ surprised.	I agree with Alex. Yeah, I've been thinking about it a lot, and I think that, you know, she's right about Mr. Barnes we can't we can't just jump to conclusions.	What would you say if I told you I feel ready right...now.
You're jealous!	I don't like her; I don't trust her, and I'm afraid that she's gonna hurt you.	I'm serious. Look, no ramifications, nothing, just tell me what you think	He's not sleeping with her.
So, "Shut up" because you're so jealous of her...that you don't even care that I'm happy for once.	Shut up!	You're jealous!	I don't like her; I don't trust her, and I'm afraid that she's gonna hurt you.
Do not, under any circumstances, say what you're thinking.	Do you honestly believe that's what's going on here?	So, "Shut up" because you're so jealous of her...that you don't even care that I'm happy for once.	Shut up!
Why don't I ever listen to me?	I'm sorry, but you had your chance with me.	Do not, under any circumstances, say what you're thinking.	Do you honestly believe that's what's going on here?
So, are we doing this, or what?	Hey, I'm finally off; do you wanna get out of here?Hello?	When you can't make things right with one of your best friends, nothing can make you feel better.	Yeah, it's not about that anymore, is it?
So, you never came over here last night 'cause you just passed out.	J.D....	These are Percocet.	See, all I did was lose the pants, but I think it gives me a completely different look.
The speech always sounds the same, no matter whose mouth is comes out of even if it's someone you thought you could really like.	Yep...I should I should go; yeah.	So, you never came over here last night 'cause you just passed out.	J.D....
We ended up talking for a while after that....	Hey, look, you don't understand, okay; my job comes with a lot of stress. It's it's not like I have a serious problem.	The speech always sounds the same, no matter whose mouth is comes out of even if it's someone you thought you could really like.	Yep...I should I should go; yeah.
No.... But, why does that matter?	You never did sleep with her, did you?	All right, I should've done this a long time ago; so, here goes: I'm sorry. I shouldn't accuse you of being jealous, you were just looking out for me, and...you were right about Alex.	Twenty bucks.
Are you sure?	Because I was jealous.	No.... But, why does that matter?	You never did sleep with her, did you?
It's not a big deal!	Yeah, it's, uh, it's really not a big deal.	All the time!	Dammit.We we really shouldn't feel weird about this. I mean, this things like this happen all the time.
No more repeating....	Okay, you've gotta stop repeating everything I say in that weird tone of voice.	It's not a big deal!	Yeah, it's, uh, it's really not a big deal.
I totally agree.	Look, J.D., what happened last night was a wonderful mistake. I think it's probably best if we just go back to the way things were.	No more repeating....	Okay, you've gotta stop repeating everything I say in that weird tone of voice.
Tomorrow...	Well, I'm gonna see you tomorrow.	I totally agree.	Look, J.D., what happened last night was a wonderful mistake. I think it's probably best if we just go back to the way things were.
Wait, Elliot.Look, I just, uh.... Argggh.... I...I....	What are you doing? Elliot's amazing, and you're crazy about her. If you let her leave, I'm gonna do this all day: "I get knocked down! But I get up again! You're never gonna keep me down! I get knocked down! "	Tomorrow...	Well, I'm gonna see you tomorrow.
Yeah, let's do that.	Oh, my God, just say it! Say, "Elliot, stay in bed and have sex with me all day until neither one of us can move."	Wait, Elliot.Look, I just, uh.... Argggh.... I...I....	What are you doing? Elliot's amazing, and you're crazy about her. If you let her leave, I'm gonna do this all day: "I get knocked down! But I get up again! You're never gonna keep me down! I get knocked down! "
Oh, I'm I'm good for that.Whoa.... I got...to, uh....	I cannot believe you almost let me leave.You're gonna pay for that.	Yeah, let's do that.	Oh, my God, just say it! Say, "Elliot, stay in bed and have sex with me all day until neither one of us can move."
Yeah, you did.	I think I already did.	Well, I was, girl. I mean, four times? I mean, seriously, give it up.	What about you? You just look surprised that you're actually having sex!
What movie are we watching?	God, how weird was that this morning? I mean, have you ever been more uncomfortable in your entire life?	Yeah, you did.	I think I already did.
...And I really like your nose....	Mmmm.	It's 'Basic Instinct', grandma....Yeah, once. But see, all this sex, it just soothes my soul....	What movie are we watching?
I don't even remember. I just know I went to the door, and when I came back, you said I looked sexy holding a pizza.	How did that last time even start?	...And I really like your nose....	Mmmm.
No, no....	Oooh, you did.Okay, for safety reasons, I should go. I should really go.	I don't even remember. I just know I went to the door, and when I came back, you said I looked sexy holding a pizza.	How did that last time even start?
You're not going anywhere; 'cause you know why? You gotta help me eat this pizza.	Yep.	No, no....	Oooh, you did.Okay, for safety reasons, I should go. I should really go.
See, now, you even look sexy holding that slice.	Okay.	You're not going anywhere; 'cause you know why? You gotta help me eat this pizza.	Yep.
You do.	...I do, don't I?	See, now, you even look sexy holding that slice.	Okay.
Ha! Clever! You know, she told me she's not going out with anyone, you should ask her out.	I know where The Todd would like Elliot to be: In his pants!	I don't know. Why should I know? You know, it's funny that you think I would know I have no idea where she is.	So, Elliot says she's looking for a surgical consult. Do you know where she is?
Dude, Joanie loves Chachi.	Whoa, Ell no, no. Elliot and The Todd? That's a terrible couple. That's that's worse than Joanie and Chachi.	Ha! Clever! You know, she told me she's not going out with anyone, you should ask her out.	I know where The Todd would like Elliot to be: In his pants!
Please....	The Todd is asking Elliot out. I think she'd be lucky to ride my	Dude, Joanie loves Chachi.	Whoa, Ell no, no. Elliot and The Todd? That's a terrible couple. That's that's worse than Joanie and Chachi.
Plus, there's rumors going around that you're a lesbian.Look, you told me not to tell anyone about us, and I guess maybe I just wanted to make a point. And, uh...now I'm gonna kiss you.	What?	I don't know.... Because you're cute, and you're fun...and I told him to....	Why did he ask me out?
Yep. You my girlfriend?	Okay. You my boyfriend?	Okay, let's do it; let's have the talk.	You know what, after I have sex five times with somebody, I...usually like to have the relationship talk.I know, I know it seems rushed, but, you have to understand, five times usually takes me anywhere between six months and seven years.
Cool.Good to talk things through.	Yep!	Yep. You my girlfriend?	Okay. You my boyfriend?
Well, from now on, that is your laugh.	I love that little laugh!	Cool.Good to talk things through.	Yep!
That's not true.	You know you only laugh at your own jokes? I mean, you never laugh at anything I do.	Well, see, it's not as charming if you're mad.	Yeah, I love it so much, I can't stop using it.
Oh, all right, maybe you just don't know funny. Okay; let me help you out: Silly hats are funny; ALF, very funny; anyone in a chicken suit.... Oh! Over-sized phones are funny.	Oh hey, Dr. Cox, I'm open! Hit me!There was nothing funny about that.	That's not true.	You know you only laugh at your own jokes? I mean, you never laugh at anything I do.
Hold on.Hello? ... ... She's right here.It's for you.	J.D....	Oh, all right, maybe you just don't know funny. Okay; let me help you out: Silly hats are funny; ALF, very funny; anyone in a chicken suit.... Oh! Over-sized phones are funny.	Oh hey, Dr. Cox, I'm open! Hit me!There was nothing funny about that.
I'm sorry!	Oh, so now I'm neurotic.	You know what, Elliot, it's hard to be honest with you when you're so neurotic, you don't even trust the computer to keep your score.	You don't always have to patronize me, I mean, you could just be honest with me and tell me that I suck.
Bowling's a tricky sport.	Is it always this hard?	I'm sorry!	Oh, so now I'm neurotic.
I know what you meant. It's difficult for everybody.	No, I meant	Bowling's a tricky sport.	Is it always this hard?
Ohh, a perfect dismount off her high horse.	Look, if you can't talk about this for real, then forget it.	Well, if I didn't respect you, I wouldn't be having sex with you. ...That's not true, I totally would be!	Look, I know that you want Dr. Cox to like you and to respect you, but you should want me to like and respect you, too.
Why is it impossible for you to ever let anything go?	If you don't like something, why don't you just say it; I mean, why do you always have to hide behind your stupid little jokes!?	Ohh, a perfect dismount off her high horse.	Look, if you can't talk about this for real, then forget it.
And when are you when are you letting that stuff go?	Oh, I let tons of stuff go; like when you wouldn't stand up for me in front of Dr. Cox. Or when you started telling everyone we know that we're having sex.	Why is it impossible for you to ever let anything go?	If you don't like something, why don't you just say it; I mean, why do you always have to hide behind your stupid little jokes!?
Oh, and that's a bad thing? That's a bad thing, Elliot? Why don't why don't we get all of my friends together in a room and we'll fight your friend.	Fine. You wanna know why I won't let that go? Because the only reason that you wouldn't stand up for me is that you're so terrified that someone, somewhere, in this hospital won't like you.	And when are you when are you letting that stuff go?	Oh, I let tons of stuff go; like when you wouldn't stand up for me in front of Dr. Cox. Or when you started telling everyone we know that we're having sex.
Look, Elliot, this is me, okay? And there's a lot of people here who like me for who I am. I thought you were one of 'em.	I'm getting so tired of this.	Oh, and that's a bad thing? That's a bad thing, Elliot? Why don't why don't we get all of my friends together in a room and we'll fight your friend.	Fine. You wanna know why I won't let that go? Because the only reason that you wouldn't stand up for me is that you're so terrified that someone, somewhere, in this hospital won't like you.
Yeah... I think it's gonna be great.	So......Do you think this is gonna work out?	I will. 'Cause I'm a gentleman.	If you tell anyone anything about today, please leave that part out.
I believe me, too.	I believe you.	Yeah... I think it's gonna be great.	So......Do you think this is gonna work out?
Damn!	You watch where you're walking!	Just... You watch where you're walking.	Don't let her get the last word.
You don't even play sports.	Try as hard as you can to avoid them, you're bound to runAnd the next day...And the next day.	Damn!	You watch where you're walking!
Feel better?	It so happens, this helps me to relieve stress.	You don't even play sports.	Try as hard as you can to avoid them, you're bound to runAnd the next day...And the next day.
The truth is that Dr. Cox isn't really angry. He's justOkay, maybe he's a little angry.	And of course the lab tech is nowhere to be found, so I can't get	I guess after a while you get used to Dr. Cox's rants.	Get in here.
Ugh. Could Turk have picked anyone worse to be doing this	Yeah. It's me.	Yo, you are not going to believe what Dr. Cox...It's you.	I'm a nervous poo-er.
Uh, I'm going to go to bed.	If this is a peripheral vascular disease study, they might find it	Ugh. Could Turk have picked anyone worse to be doing this	Yeah. It's me.
But Dr. Cox, I...Okay! Okay!	Listen up, little piggy. You open up this	All the way?Okay boy. Who is it?	Downtown.
Look, Dr. Cox, I'd invite you in, but I...	Oh dear lord, please tell me that's not a onesie.	But Dr. Cox, I...Okay! Okay!	Listen up, little piggy. You open up this
Oh thank God.	Marcia, I have no interest in coming in.	Look, Dr. Cox, I'd invite you in, but I...	Oh dear lord, please tell me that's not a onesie.
Ah, yucky.	Laura, if you don't toss that shot back, I'm going to throw you up on	Ah, minty.Okay, so we're here. What do you want to talk about?	Thank you.
Yucky.	Yucky?	Ah, yucky.	Laura, if you don't toss that shot back, I'm going to throw you up on
So if you're not going to talk to me, what's the point of sitting here	My god, I'm drinking with a mouseketeer. Two more.	Yucky.	Yucky?
Hello, ladies. Oh yes, it's a onesie.	You know, it's a good point. It is Excuse me, ladies? Do you know anybody who might like to	So if you're not going to talk to me, what's the point of sitting here	My god, I'm drinking with a mouseketeer. Two more.
I love to melt the middle.	I'm not fine. I mean, why do you think we're out here at this bar at 2	Well. You seem fine, so...	Thanks for coming out, there, Newbie. Hope this whole thing wasn't too
Passed away.	Uh huh. And what happened to that schoolteacher you were prattling on	How you like me now, bitch?Maybe I just don't have anything bottled up.	Well, at least I let mine go. You, if you ever were able to actually
I made a joke.	Croaksville. That's what I thought. And what was the first thing you	Passed away.	Uh huh. And what happened to that schoolteacher you were prattling on
Jerome!	Let's face it, we've earned the right to be a little cocky.	Ow!	I hate you guys! I hate you, I hate you, I hate you!
Because after months of having to do everyone else's scut-work, we're finally not the lowest people on the totem pole.	Oh, thank goodness, it's the Mod Squad.	And I gotta tell ya, nobody can take this feeling away. Nobody.	My man! Hey, who the hell is Jerome?
You see, today...we get our very own med students.	Look at you three, all excited!	Because after months of having to do everyone else's scut-work, we're finally not the lowest people on the totem pole.	Oh, thank goodness, it's the Mod Squad.
So, I dunno-I'm just thinking I wa-I want someone I can be friends with, you know?	Giiirl!	Sugar darlin'!	Nope! But, knowing this hospital, it's probably someone black!
So, do you have any questions before we get started?	It totally messes everyone up!	No.	Really? Do you ever part your hair on the wrong side just to see what you look like to other people?
Easy, tiger!	Yeah, what's the babe situation like around here?	So, do you have any questions before we get started?	It totally messes everyone up!
I'll call Ripley's!	I do.	He wrote down the guy sweats when he exercises.	Relax, Bambi. Be nice to Thumper!
Yes, Carla! They're each one mistake, but when you put 'em all together, it makes, like, 4 million mistakes!	Relax, Bambi, it's just one mista	Yeah it was! Okay!	Cool! Great first day, Dr. Dorian!
I'm s I'm sorry.	Yeah, you are.	I'm sorry.	Mmm-hmmm.
Carla... I gotta go home.	Egh.	I'm s I'm sorry.	Yeah, you are.
No, no, no. But Josh did all this.	Hold it, Q-Tip. You have to co-sign all these orders, fill out a vascular consult on Bed 3, and get a tox-screen for Mrs. O'Brien.	Carla... I gotta go home.	Egh.
Mrs. O'Brien, I'm afraid I'm gonna need a urine sample.	Uh-uh, honey. I don't think so.	No, no, no. But Josh did all this.	Hold it, Q-Tip. You have to co-sign all these orders, fill out a vascular consult on Bed 3, and get a tox-screen for Mrs. O'Brien.
It's not like I forced him to quit.	J.D. trying to keep up with Turk.	I mean, he was screwing up constantly.	J.D. Trying to keep up with Nurse Roberts.
I just don't think it's my fault he quit.	J.D. standing against the doorframe looking into the Admissions Area.	It's not like I forced him to quit.	J.D. trying to keep up with Turk.
I was talking to her.	I don't know.... I think most of the bad things that happen around here are your fault.	I just don't think it's my fault he quit.	J.D. standing against the doorframe looking into the Admissions Area.
Even Nurse Roberts says he's the most incompetent young doctor she's ever worked with.	Well, I'm not gonna tell you what you wanna hear.	I was talking to her.	I don't know.... I think most of the bad things that happen around here are your fault.
But Josh, those are the same things that I was dealing with when I first started here.... Except for the the ass part.... I actually have a...great ass. It's...firm, like mutton.	Look at me! I'm clumsy, I'm always throwing up, I don't even have an ass!	Why would anyone feel sorry for you?	Look, Dr. Dorian, I know what you're trying to do. My whole life, people have felt sorry for me.
Could you...re-do that?	G'head.That's it.	What do you want, a cookie? Go put your scrubs on and get back here.Go go go!	No way!
Are you bummed out that we have the same name?Oh, don't don't worry about it, man; I'll tell you what you're a little bit older than I am, so you were J.D. first. So how about you'll be J.D. Number One, and I'll just be J.D. Number Two. How about that?	Make him leave.	How's it going, man?	No. Nope. Oh, this'll be fun. J.D., I would like you to meet, J.D.
Hey Number One. So, uh, I've got one more patient, do you want to have lunch in ten minutes and you can bring my clipboard?	Hey Number Two.	Are you bummed out that we have the same name?Oh, don't don't worry about it, man; I'll tell you what you're a little bit older than I am, so you were J.D. first. So how about you'll be J.D. Number One, and I'll just be J.D. Number Two. How about that?	Make him leave.
Okay.	Yeah.	Hey Number One. So, uh, I've got one more patient, do you want to have lunch in ten minutes and you can bring my clipboard?	Hey Number Two.
Number One!All right, cool.	Hey, Number Two!	Okay.	Yeah.
Number One!	Hey, Number Two!	Number One!All right, cool.	Hey, Number Two!
Okay, Mr. Simon. Good morning, how you feeling?	About time. Idiot.	I honestly think the best part about working here is the patients. When they see how much you care, they're always grateful.	Number One!
No, sir, I was just trying to assess how you're	I was just asking Nurse Fajita here if you guys get extra points for asking stupid questions.	Okay, Mr. Simon. Good morning, how you feeling?	About time. Idiot.
Carla, please. Sir, if there's anything I can do to make your stay here more comfortable	Bambi. Don't bother.	No, sir, I was just trying to assess how you're	I was just asking Nurse Fajita here if you guys get extra points for asking stupid questions.
Okay. Will you hold me after?Maybe we shouldn't bother.	You can kiss my man-sized ass!	Carla, please. Sir, if there's anything I can do to make your stay here more comfortable	Bambi. Don't bother.
Frank used to be a Navy SEAL.	Frank.	Which one?	Hey Bambi, you know Mr. Simon made one of the night nurses cry?
Hey, Number One.	Hey, Number Two!	Frank used to be a Navy SEAL.	Frank.
Toodles.	Beat it, junior.	Just going to have Carla here give you a little stronger pain medication.	What the hell do you want?
Huh. Where did Mr. Simon go?	Yeah.	Do you have to ask?	Mmm, is it working?
Hey, Number One.	Yeah. Say "Hey, Number One".	He went so fast.	Hey, Number Two!
Mommy, are you and Daddy playing wheelbarrow?	J.D., when you were a kid, did you used to walk into your parent's room in the middle of the night?	Just thought I'd talk to you guys.	Not now, maybe in the morning before work...
Yes, once.	Son, you go back to bed, I'm fixing Mommy's back.	Mommy, are you and Daddy playing wheelbarrow?	J.D., when you were a kid, did you used to walk into your parent's room in the middle of the night?
You're right. Argh...thank you, Carla.	Well, could have been the neglect. Could have been the terminal cancer. Bambi, you're a conscientious doctor, you'd never do anything to hurt a patient, you know that.	I just can't stop thinking about Mr. Simon. I neglected him because he was such a jerk; and I'm just kinda worried that's what killed him.	What's up, Bambi?
Peace out, Turk!	Mmm-hmm.	You're right. Argh...thank you, Carla.	Well, could have been the neglect. Could have been the terminal cancer. Bambi, you're a conscientious doctor, you'd never do anything to hurt a patient, you know that.
We all know what goes on in the bedroom...	Night.	Peace out, Turk!	Mmm-hmm.
Is it hot in here? It's, like, it's hot!No, I'm fine.	Bambi. Don't be nervous.	Morbidity and Mortality conferences are just fun little meetings they have when they think you may be in any way responsible for a patient's death.	Uh, they want you to present Mr. Simon at a M and M conference this afternoon.
Still, there's no reason to start obsessing. You did nothing wrong.	Okay.	Is it hot in here? It's, like, it's hot!No, I'm fine.	Bambi. Don't be nervous.
Okay, you have to stop doing that. Look, Number One	Hey, Number Two!	Hey, Number One.	Hey, Number Two!
Okay, listen, I know we have the same name, and I feel very bad about that; but I can't spend every second of my day playing this game with you. I'm sorry, I...	Number Two!	Okay, you have to stop doing that. Look, Number One	Hey, Number Two!
...then how come I still can't sleep?	Bottom line, Dr. Kelso isn't looking to do me any favors. If I did something wrong, he'd call me on it...	Actually, Sir, I I'm not sure how this whole thing usually works, but I was kinda hoping we could take a closer look at me.I've been sorta doubting my performance, and it would it would be really helpful if we could all talk about it. As a group.	Initially there were concerns that Mr. Simon may have been over-medicated. We have concluded that his pain control was both adequate and well within normal limits. Thank you for stopping by.
Uh huh.	I have to warn you, I just got dumped in front of my ex-wife not ten minutes ago, okay Betty? It's always easy to treat the nice ones nice, isn't it?	Depends what you mean by different, I	Of course you didn't, and I always check your orders after you make them. But if you're wondering whether or not you treated Mr. Simon differently because he's a complete jerk, well... I think you know the answer to that one already, don't you?
You know, it's, uh it's barely misting out...	But your drug addicts, your child abusers, your garden-variety jerks... Man.	Uh huh.	I have to warn you, I just got dumped in front of my ex-wife not ten minutes ago, okay Betty? It's always easy to treat the nice ones nice, isn't it?
Mine too!	It's my hair, if it even gets damp, it frizzes out and becomes wildly unmanageable.	You know, it's, uh it's barely misting out...	But your drug addicts, your child abusers, your garden-variety jerks... Man.
Oh, I am so sorry.	Our parents are coming.	And that’s when Elliot said something that explained everything.	Come on, what right do they have to be so damn mopey?
It’s all right.	I could tell my friends were pretty upset. Still, there was a bright side....	Oh, I am so sorry.	Our parents are coming.
...I knew I could make it worse.	It’s all right.	I could tell my friends were pretty upset. Still, there was a bright side....	Oh, I am so sorry.
You missed a spot!	...I knew I could make it worse.	It’s all right.	I could tell my friends were pretty upset. Still, there was a bright side....
I like the pictures.	You know, you can help. You can't even hear the television!	You missed a spot!	...I knew I could make it worse.
Hey, Dad. No, no, nothing. Turk and Elliot are freaking out because their parents are coming to visit.	If I believed in karma, I might be a little more cautious about giving these guys a hard time...	I like the pictures.	You know, you can help. You can't even hear the television!
But karma doesn't scare me!	Hey, Dad. No, no, nothing. Turk and Elliot are freaking out because their parents are coming to visit.	If I believed in karma, I might be a little more cautious about giving these guys a hard time...	I like the pictures.
No, no, no, no, it hasn't been that long since you and I saw each other.Dad...	But karma doesn't scare me!	Hey, Dad. No, no, nothing. Turk and Elliot are freaking out because their parents are coming to visit.	If I believed in karma, I might be a little more cautious about giving these guys a hard time...
Dad, please!	God, I'd like to take a run at her. Would you take a look at her rack?	My mom and dad got divorced when I was seven. I know that's not so unusual but even though everyone's relationship with their father seems different, mine always seemed *very* different.	Oh, get some chips!Wowzer! Rowdy's a boy dog.
There it is!	You know, your mother had a beautiful bosom.	Okay, you know, I think I'm going to hit the sack before I get even more uncomfortable.	That is correct, Christopher.
That was a nice moment.	Count it!	Oh, my God! Dad!	Fire in the hole!
Yeah...	Look, Reba, if I ask you a question that doesn't specifically deal with a medical issue, you can bet your powdered bottom that I don't want you to answer. Do you understand?	Well, sort of. Elliot and Turk wrote this paper and then my dad decided "I want to come, too!"	What in the hell is this? Parents weekend?
Ooo! Ooo!	It's like... working with a monkey!	Yeah...	Look, Reba, if I ask you a question that doesn't specifically deal with a medical issue, you can bet your powdered bottom that I don't want you to answer. Do you understand?
Nothing.	What?	Ooo! Ooo!	It's like... working with a monkey!
Excuse me?	You can help me by minding your own damn business!	Can I help you, sir? Sir?	So, uh, how long are you guys staying?
Nice meeting you.	Oh, aggressive, huh? Do you really want to get it on with me, Pipsqueak? Because if you do, I guarantee it'll be the last stupid thing you ever do on God's green earth.	Excuse me?	You can help me by minding your own damn business!
Actually, I	Hey, I have to give the med students a lecture on heart murmurs tomorrow. Could you cover for me?	He can't be that mad. We both know that even though residents are supposed to teach you, they really only show up when they want something.	This is your basic arthrocentesis, there, Newbie. Your resident should've showed you how to do this a long time ago.
That sucks. I totally wanted to spend some time with my dad tomorrow.	Thanks, man.	Actually, I	Hey, I have to give the med students a lecture on heart murmurs tomorrow. Could you cover for me?
What do you mean?	Then take him?	That sucks. I totally wanted to spend some time with my dad tomorrow.	Thanks, man.
I don't I don't think you really get my dad. He's not really interested in my work. He's more like a buddy.	Uh, I don't know, secure a vehicle of some kind car, balloon, tricycle and transport your father from wherever he is to where you're going to be.	What do you mean?	Then take him?
The thing is, I don't really need a buddy. What I need is a father.	Ohhh-kay, that was my mistake. Here I engaged you and gave you the impression that I actually care which is just so wrong! God!	I don't I don't think you really get my dad. He's not really interested in my work. He's more like a buddy.	Uh, I don't know, secure a vehicle of some kind car, balloon, tricycle and transport your father from wherever he is to where you're going to be.
I have testicles.He's he's a kidder! Heh.	Well, you definitely need something. Um, maybe a backbone, or perhaps some testicles. At the very least, a pillow that you could carry around the hospital and just cry your sad eyes out into whenever drama occures.	The thing is, I don't really need a buddy. What I need is a father.	Ohhh-kay, that was my mistake. Here I engaged you and gave you the impression that I actually care which is just so wrong! God!
And that's when I decided to take a chance.	I know! Lemme tell ya, there are no gratuitous winks in the Reid household. It's like...	If that's not saying, "I love you and I'm proud of you," I'm not really sure what is.	Can you believe my dad winked at me?
That means a lot, Dad.	Are you kidding? I'd love to come to your heart murmur lecture! I'm a big fan of those things!	And that's when I decided to take a chance.	I know! Lemme tell ya, there are no gratuitous winks in the Reid household. It's like...
Well, uhh, umm...	John Dorian, get over here.	Hi, Ms. Turk.	Thank you.
Well, remember on Thanksgiving when I said your turkey was dry and you picked me up and shook me?	After all these years, are you still afraid of me?	Well, uhh, umm...	John Dorian, get over here.
I always thought parents were like tornadoes.They blow into town and devastate everything in their path.	Yeah, I prefer to call them dreams. I'm gonna-I'm gonna steal another Jell-o.	But Dad, you sell office supplies.	Work is great, Johnny. I like to believe that I'm selling dreams.
There's no food on your tray.	Hi...	I always thought parents were like tornadoes.They blow into town and devastate everything in their path.	Yeah, I prefer to call them dreams. I'm gonna-I'm gonna steal another Jell-o.
But it's different for me.	Oh.	There's no food on your tray.	Hi...
No.	How you doin', Elliot?Great talk. Uh, anyway, Johnny, I was talking to my buddy Jake this afternoon. You remember my buddy Jake?	But it's different for me.	Oh.
Right!	Well, anwyay, Jake's my buddy and he's leaving the country for who knows how long so I thought I might get out of here tomorrow afternoon and go catch up with him which would mean I'd miss your thing but I wouldn't know what I was hearing anyway. Right?	No.	How you doin', Elliot?Great talk. Uh, anyway, Johnny, I was talking to my buddy Jake this afternoon. You remember my buddy Jake?
I probably should have woken him up to say good-bye, considering he'd be gone before I got home. I told myself I wanted to let the old guy get some sleep but even I didn't believe that.	You still talking to yourself? I thought you'd outgrow that by now.	I think what surprised me the most was that I was actually surprised.	Right!
I meant that later I'm not that busy	Well, if you're not that busy, then you have time to do this discharge summary for me.	Yeah, I'm not that busy.	Yo, J.D., you wanna grab a bite with us tonight after Elliot and I do our presentation?
Arrrrgh!	Fantastic!	I meant that later I'm not that busy	Well, if you're not that busy, then you have time to do this discharge summary for me.
What? No!	I'm sorry, um, you're not on drugs, are you?	My dad flaked on me again.	Now, you've got to at least try and pace yourself, Newbie, otherwise sure as shootin' you're going to burn out. Come.Oh, I heard the sad sigh, I see your shoulders are slumped, and I'm aware that you have some whiny-ass problem that you want to talk to me about because you probably think it'd be cathartic to get it the hell off your chest but believe me it won't be. What you've got to do, for me, is the healthy thing. Keep all of your feelings bottled up inside where they *so* belong!
I skipped lunch but I've been snacking all day.	Are you in jail? Have you been beaten? Are you malnourished?	What? No!	I'm sorry, um, you're not on drugs, are you?
Well, he did some considerable emotional damage, so...	You are, in fact, a perfectly healthy twenty-six-year-old doctor who keeps crying about how horrible his father was.	I skipped lunch but I've been snacking all day.	Are you in jail? Have you been beaten? Are you malnourished?
If it's okay with you, we just won't talk right now. Got a needle. Need to focus.	So... how's it going down there?	Part of me thought Cox was wrong and I had every reason to be angry with my father.	Oh, mama!
Hey, Dad.	But then I stopped thinking of my dad as a father, and started thinking of him as a man. And I realized some things that deep down I probably always knew. Like, maybe he wasn't crashing on my couch to spend more quality time with me but because he couldn't afford a hotel room.And maybe he wasn't going to see his buddy Jake to catch up, but because Jake was someone he might be able to sell something to and he really needs a sale.And maybe the truth is, he's just a middle-aged lonely guy trying to get by and it sure would be nice if someone would give him a break once and a while.	If it's okay with you, we just won't talk right now. Got a needle. Need to focus.	So... how's it going down there?
You know, I did, but I got someone to cover for me because I wanted to make sure I caught you and let you know how cool it was to see you.	Hey, there he is! I thought you had to work all day.	Hey, Dad.	But then I stopped thinking of my dad as a father, and started thinking of him as a man. And I realized some things that deep down I probably always knew. Like, maybe he wasn't crashing on my couch to spend more quality time with me but because he couldn't afford a hotel room.And maybe he wasn't going to see his buddy Jake to catch up, but because Jake was someone he might be able to sell something to and he really needs a sale.And maybe the truth is, he's just a middle-aged lonely guy trying to get by and it sure would be nice if someone would give him a break once and a while.
Yeah.	Really?	You know, I did, but I got someone to cover for me because I wanted to make sure I caught you and let you know how cool it was to see you.	Hey, there he is! I thought you had to work all day.
That would be really great.	Well... Well, listen, I, um, you know, I have to travel a lot lately so I'm sure I'll be back in this region again soon. I could swing back out to see you.	Yeah.	Really?
Great.	Great.	That would be really great.	Well... Well, listen, I, um, you know, I have to travel a lot lately so I'm sure I'll be back in this region again soon. I could swing back out to see you.
I see you've been taking advantage of the farting policy.	Great. I'd be happy to see you.	Great.	Great.
I'm not gonna pull your finger!	Hey, pull my finger!	I see you've been taking advantage of the farting policy.	Great. I'd be happy to see you.
I know, but did you see "A" through "K"? 'Cause I did a really cool thing with "A" through "K."	Yeah, I just figured I'd come down and check it out. You know, see how you were doing. And for the record, that was atrocious. I mean, downright abysmal.	And "Z" is for the Zs you'll be getting, now that you know heart murmurs from "A" to "Z."What are you doing here?	Thank you very much, folks. We've been great.
I missed this.	Yeah, what's that, a shot at my dad? That's stepping over the line, pal.	Tell me about it.	Yup.Heh, heh. Parents, huh?
What?	Let's play Steak.	Turk turns everything in to a competition. It can get kind of annoying.	Let's put Rowdy on top of the TV and see which one of us can throw a hat on him first.
No, see, I paid seventeen dollars for this steak, and I'm not gonna....You want some?	Steak: The first person to finish their steak is the winner of Steak.	What?	Let's play Steak.
The problem is, these stupid games always seem to end the same way.	Uh-huh.Ankles is a simple game: The first one to get embarrassed and pull up their scrubs loses.	No, see, I paid seventeen dollars for this steak, and I'm not gonna....You want some?	Steak: The first person to finish their steak is the winner of Steak.
I'm your beeyotch.	HA! HahahahaHA! Say it!Say it!Just say it.	The problem is, these stupid games always seem to end the same way.	Uh-huh.Ankles is a simple game: The first one to get embarrassed and pull up their scrubs loses.
Yeah.	This is fun.	Yeah.	Can I play?
I can't believe you're turning this into a competition. Luckily, it's not up to you it's up to Mr. Hoffner.	How frequent?	That's why we're gonna give him frequent colonoscopies!	He's high-risk for colon cancer!
You're getting a meat plate for dinner!	I'm gonna go with surgery.	I can't believe you're turning this into a competition. Luckily, it's not up to you it's up to Mr. Hoffner.	How frequent?
I'm your beeyotch.	Say it!	Aaaaaaaaaaaagggggggghhhhhhhhhh!	"A surgeon and a doc, above...it...all!"
I'm a big	You're my big boy!	I am!	Oh, you're my big boy!
Benedict Arnold?	What?	What's up, Benedict.	Rough all over. So don't talk to me, Joanie, just go talk to your patient. Go!
Oh yeah?	That's just the lamest smack-talk I've ever heard in my life.	Benedict Arnold?	What?
Well, that's not what the red-coats thought!	Yeah.	Oh yeah?	That's just the lamest smack-talk I've ever heard in my life.
So, what's up, man? You're gonna go under the knife just 'cause that guy told you to?	Wow! You went Colonial on his ass!	Well, that's not what the red-coats thought!	Yeah.
Like who?	No, I spoke to some other people.	So, what's up, man? You're gonna go under the knife just 'cause that guy told you to?	Wow! You went Colonial on his ass!
He's a janitor!	All fixed.	Like who?	No, I spoke to some other people.
Excuse me?	Tough.	That was my patient, Turk! I brought you in as my friend, and you're so damn competitive you just go ahead and take him from me? That sucks!	I, too, decided it was time to act like the most confident girl in the room, and face things head-on.
Oh, you know, that sounds like a great friendship.	You're damn right I'm competitive. See, that's what makes me a good doctor I want to win at everything every day, and you should, too.	Excuse me?	Tough.
He never got the concept of the team.	Dude, if you don't wanna play Steak again, that's fine, all right? This has nothing to do with friendship, and you know it! So stop blaming me, because the truth is you're angry at yourself 'cause you couldn't get the guy to believe in you!	Oh, you know, that sounds like a great friendship.	You're damn right I'm competitive. See, that's what makes me a good doctor I want to win at everything every day, and you should, too.
I win at Cookie.	I know. Have a cookie, man.	He never got the concept of the team.	Dude, if you don't wanna play Steak again, that's fine, all right? This has nothing to do with friendship, and you know it! So stop blaming me, because the truth is you're angry at yourself 'cause you couldn't get the guy to believe in you!
Bottom line, when the stakes are high, you have to go for the win. You know, as long as you don't get caught up in the petty stuff.	Go.Let's get you some sherbet!	What?	You won. Now beat it.
Look! It's got a letter!	Boink. Who's your new friend?	One of the best things about women is that they're so unpredictable. Of course, that can really bite you in the ass.	Yep. Right.
Nurse Roberts is gonna take a blood sample so we can check your Hepatitis viral load absolutely no big deal.	Can we get a move on, Q-Tip? I got tickets to "Bring in Da Noise, Bring in Da Funk" and I don't want to miss The Noise.	And I was having problems with my lady, too.	"Eat your doughnut."
Could somebody get that?	No big deal at all!	Nurse Roberts is gonna take a blood sample so we can check your Hepatitis viral load absolutely no big deal.	Can we get a move on, Q-Tip? I got tickets to "Bring in Da Noise, Bring in Da Funk" and I don't want to miss The Noise.
Thanks. That's, uh, that's comforting.	If you should develop any symptoms that suggest you may have contracted Hepatitis B, this form simply states the hospital is not responsible.	What's this?	Just get him to sign the damn paper!
Hey, here's your pen.	Um, I'm I'm sure you'll be fine.	Thanks. That's, uh, that's comforting.	If you should develop any symptoms that suggest you may have contracted Hepatitis B, this form simply states the hospital is not responsible.
She got some aaaction!Come on...it's funny!	Ugh!	Somebody got some a action!	Well?
The curse of the scrubs machine one of the hospital's most annoying money savers. The only way to get clean scrubs out is to put dirty ones in.	I can't find my scrubs top! I must have left it at Sean's.	She got some aaaction!Come on...it's funny!	Ugh!
How else can I help?	Give me your shirt.	How can I help?	The curse of the scrubs machine one of the hospital's most annoying money savers. The only way to get clean scrubs out is to put dirty ones in.
Okay.	Just go!	How else can I help?	Give me your shirt.
He's okay, right?	I once had a colleague who got bit by a patient with rabies.	Oh, I got hit with the business end of one of my Hep-B patients' syringes last night.	So, junior, what's with the antecubital veinal puncture?
I, uh, I have to go check on a...thing.	Ohhh...maybe!	Well, I'll I'll be okay.	Oh, but Hepatitis! Scary stuff.
You know, I could be really sick here! Could you be nice for once in your life?	We've secretly replaced this doctor's blood with Hepatitis blood. Let's see if he notices!	You see, nobody keeps John Dorian from moving on. Nobody!	I don't know anything about those.You have to read "Tales of the Fourth Grade Nothing" completely turned high school around for me!
What's your problem?	Shut up!	You knew the answer to that.	HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor?
No. Oh, come on, I have problems, too!	This stuff doesn't come as easy to me as it does for you, okay? I study every night, and you know what else I have to do to try and remember all this crap? I tape-record myself saying it, and then I listen to myself over and over. Do you have any idea how annoying it is to hear myself go on and on and on...and on...and on...?	What's your problem?	Shut up!
I traded my meningitis patient just traded him, like a baseball card. And you wanna know why? Because I was afraid of him!I'm a doctor who's afraid of sick people! You wanna take a picture with me?	Oh?	No. Oh, come on, I have problems, too!	This stuff doesn't come as easy to me as it does for you, okay? I study every night, and you know what else I have to do to try and remember all this crap? I tape-record myself saying it, and then I listen to myself over and over. Do you have any idea how annoying it is to hear myself go on and on and on...and on...and on...?
Thank you. Now, can I have my patient back?	Well, gosh, Newbie, I don't know what it was about that day. Maybe I hadn't had enough sleep. Maybe my mind was on other things. Maybe I didn't have enough fiber in my diet, and I failed to do my morning business. I don't know what the hell it was, but the bottom line is I didn't feel like spelling it out for you. And I know, I know, you want your little speech, and that's fine because here it is: You're a doctor. You might get sick. Get over it.	No, see, you're full of it you knew I was scared, why didn't you just tell me to go in there and deal with it?	Because you asked me to. Oh, and because of your puppy-dog eyes.
Fantastic.	No. Because, aside from his weird Judy Bloom obsession, I like him. You will be de-lousing Mr. Schaffer guy's like fly-paper!	Thank you. Now, can I have my patient back?

You know, when you start med school they warn you that you're gonna have to make sacrifices.... But I guess that means different things to different people.	Oh, and, Belinda? D'you know what else is real contagious?A big ol' smile!	Fantastic.	No. Because, aside from his weird Judy Bloom obsession, I like him. You will be de-lousing Mr. Schaffer guy's like fly-paper!

So, what's that, like your lucky board...or something?	Newbie, no one likes a lookie-loo. Not now, not ever.	Neat hug!	Yeah, I scored this big restoration job.So, who's the, uh, fan club?
Oh, my God, that's disgusting!	Oh, that? No, it's a nail-gun accident.	So, what's that, like your lucky board...or something?	Newbie, no one likes a lookie-loo. Not now, not ever.
You're a little weird, aren't you.	When they're posed, they're not real. You know, I hate that whole, like, "gneen!" thing. That's why, at a party, you'll see me in the bushes with my camera.	Ooh!	Pictures capture moments in time.
Yeah, we were....	When spoken to, Newbie. When spoken to. Here, I thought we were clear on that one!	Me neither!	Me neither.
You know, he's never asked me to grab a beer. But I don't care....	Hey, Ben, you realize we haven't grabbed a beer in a couple of weeks what's that about?	Yeah, we were....	When spoken to, Newbie. When spoken to. Here, I thought we were clear on that one!

You're kidding, right?	I don't jump out and scare you! I follow you around all day! I only got about an hour-and-a-half worth of work around here, and the rest of the time I track you...like an animal.	OH! Why do you have to jump out and scare me all the time!?	The truth is, the hematopathologist was the last person in this hospital I wanted to deal with.
What? How did that get there? Come on, good news.	Haha.... I don't know? Am I? Hmm....	You're kidding, right?	I don't jump out and scare you! I follow you around all day! I only got about an hour-and-a-half worth of work around here, and the rest of the time I track you...like an animal.

No, I lost my thesaurus.	You're not gonna write her one of your angry notes, are you? 'Cause she doesn't deserve it.	Turk, I can fight my own battles, man.	Yeah, I know who screwed this up. It's that same lazy-ass admitting nurse that mixed up my files. And there she is! I'm gonna go get her.
Hello......Nancy. Hi, howYeah, could you just check it's a very important file that I	Okay, well you go get her, then!	No, I lost my thesaurus.	You're not gonna write her one of your angry notes, are you? 'Cause she doesn't deserve it.
You said "drop the ball."	Thank you....Look here: My friend needs you to check on the Ben Sullivan file, and you're gonna do it right now. Why? Because you're not gonna drop the ball like you did on my patient.	She said "in a minute," so I'm sure that in a minuteOh, now it's two! You're in.	Tag me in. I am oiled up and ready to go!

Can you do that?	What do you want me to do, cry?	Franklyn!Can you help me out here?	Okay, I make lots of mistakes. But I really have to go to the bathroom right now, and after that I'm going to lunch.
Quickly! Quickly!	Sure. Gimme a second to think of something sad.	Can you do that?	What do you want me to do, cry?
I'm sorry, I shouldn't even put you in this position. I	Okay, that's not helping!	Quickly! Quickly!	Sure. Gimme a second to think of something sad.
Stay with it, Elliot....	Oh, there we go. You know, another man in my life trying to protect me.	I'm sorry, I shouldn't even put you in this position. I	Okay, that's not helping!

I think this is the most uncomfortable conversation I've ever had!	I can tell, because I've seen you look at mine. Um, not in a sleazy way, or anything....	Excuse me?	Let me ask you something.You're kind of a boob guy, right?
I stand corrected! You're my best friend's girlfriend!	You wanna touch one?	I think this is the most uncomfortable conversation I've ever had!	I can tell, because I've seen you look at mine. Um, not in a sleazy way, or anything....
I'm afraid so....	Ah, so your instinct is to pass on this fantastic one-time offer?	I stand corrected! You're my best friend's girlfriend!	You wanna touch one?
Oh, sorry.	I'm up here, Bambi.	I'm afraid so....	Ah, so your instinct is to pass on this fantastic one-time offer?
Well, what am I supposed to do, though?	See, with Ben it's one of two things: Either your instincts are right, or your brain is trying to protect you from something. I'd say you have pretty good instincts. Trust them.	Oh, sorry.	I'm up here, Bambi.
The Hematopathologist.	You know there's only one more person to talk to.	Well, what am I supposed to do, though?	See, with Ben it's one of two things: Either your instincts are right, or your brain is trying to protect you from something. I'd say you have pretty good instincts. Trust them.
You go by your first name?	Call me Dr. Bob.	Hello?	The Hematopathologist.
"Fred Bob"?	No, first name's Fred.	You go by your first name?	Call me Dr. Bob.
Hi, I w I was hoping that you could recheck Ben Sullivan's blood smear.	What can I do you for?	"Fred Bob"?	No, first name's Fred.
I kinda wish you did.	Well, that depends, young man. Do you actually think I made a mistake, or do you just wish I did?	Hi, I w I was hoping that you could recheck Ben Sullivan's blood smear.	What can I do you for?
Oh, my God....	Hey! I wanted to ask you, um, how come this guy's always, like, following you in the pictures?	No, we wouldn't.	It works for me.Listen, um, you guys wouldn't be keeping me here if there wasn't something potentially wrong with me, would you?
Yeah.	Him.You want to see the rest of the pictures I took today?	Oh, my God....	Hey! I wanted to ask you, um, how come this guy's always, like, following you in the pictures?
These are good, man!Ben, good news, man!	Look at that one.	Yeah.	Him.You want to see the rest of the pictures I took today?
What do you mean?	Come on, J.D. None of this is real. You know that.	Wait, why would you want a picture like that? I thought you said that posed pictures aren't real?	After all, he had only been here one day, and there wasn't even anything wrong with him.
...Yeah....	Well, that sucks.	Uh, yeah.Ben, you have leukemia.	Let's try this again: Are those the test results?
How'd you know my middle name?	John Michael Dorian.	Ah, come on, I'm sure you don't know my name, so	I know.
Today seems like a good day to hide out in one of my patient's rooms.	Because I care!	How'd you know my middle name?	John Michael Dorian.

No, Ben! Ben, seriously! Ben! Not funny! Ben, stop! Ben, put me down. Ben! Fasterrrr! Whooooooo! Ha ha ha ha ha! Eeeee-eagle! Whooo hoooo!	You heard the good doctor. Come on, you'll have to sit this one out. You know, my hands are free which leaves me to do... this!	No, Ben. Ben! Okay, okay...	Anybody missing one of these?
I'm a good intern, but when you're dealing with disease and family, an intern just doesn't cut it. What you need......Is a hero.	I swear, if you don't start taking this seriously...	I don't like that much freedom down there. Makes me tingle in my giblets.	Ha ha, the sweatpants years.
But I didn't even say anything.	Shut up. Shut up. And definitely shut up.	I'm a good intern, but when you're dealing with disease and family, an intern just doesn't cut it. What you need......Is a hero.	I swear, if you don't start taking this seriously...
I hear you, Dr. Cox!	I know, but I enjoy saying it to you. Okay, here's the deal. If we're gonna beat this thing, and we damn sure are, we're gonna do it one way and one way only. We're gonna be a team! We're gonna be a team, team, team, team, team! You hear me?	But I didn't even say anything.	Shut up. Shut up. And definitely shut up.
I'm sorry. I got very excited. Go! Heh.	I am so not speaking to you, Rhonda, thank you!	I hear you, Dr. Cox!	I know, but I enjoy saying it to you. Okay, here's the deal. If we're gonna beat this thing, and we damn sure are, we're gonna do it one way and one way only. We're gonna be a team! We're gonna be a team, team, team, team, team! You hear me?
I didn't care about the abuse. The most amazing thing for me was to watch how Dr. Cox dealt with his friend. How he made him feel safe.	Congratulations! Your Dimaggio-like streak for saying nothing even remotely interesting is still alive and well!	Antonio played by the actor Tony Shalhoub. Also particularly fantastic in a film called "Big Night.""	"Wings." And shut up, I like the cab driver. He... slays me.
How could you possibly know that?	Your first kiss was with Sarah Briggs at the embarrassing age of sixteen. She wore a green turtleneck, and you wonder sometimes if she still thinks about you. I'm guessing no.	So you used your key to get into my personnel file. Big deal.	Your mother's maiden name is Turner.
Oh, I don't mind, I just	Well, you're just an absolute lamb but you don't have to do that.	Dr. Cox, Ben seemed pretty down after you left so I thought I could cover for you and you could go hang out with him.	The periampullary carcinoma patient had a failed palliatitive stenting of the common bile duct so this is what I want to do. I want to go ahead and prep him for a pyloris sparing pancreaticoduodenectomy. Thanks.What's up, T-Man?! Show The Todd some love!
It's funny how people handle bad news in different ways.Some people have a visceral reaction...	Newbie, stop!	Oh, I don't mind, I just	Well, you're just an absolute lamb but you don't have to do that.
Some people go into denial...	Time to get my soapy soap on!	It's funny how people handle bad news in different ways.Some people have a visceral reaction...	Newbie, stop!
And others...	No way.	Some people go into denial...	Time to get my soapy soap on!
...Others just walk away.Chemotherapy looks harmless, but it's really poison pumped directly into your veins.	What chance do you give a guy with Ben's blast percentage, huh? Twenty percent, thirty, maybe? You see, I can't handle that. I cannot. So, no thank you there, Johnny.	And others...	No way.
How are you doing this?	You like the way cashmere feels on your skin!	That's not uncommon.	You're afraid of escalators.
Look, Dr. Cox, I've been doing a lot of thinking and I honestly think that the only reason you're not down at that hospital right now is that you're afraid.	That's right! You run away! Run away from the truth!	How are you doing this?	You like the way cashmere feels on your skin!
You gotta get back in the game, Coxie!Okay, Coxie was a mistake. Pretend I didn't say Coxie.	I think you're right. I do. Partly because you've really... gotten to know me this year.But mostly it's because, well... I told you that I was afraid earlier today so please don't tell me that you've come here to reiterate things to me that I've already said because I know the things I've already said. In fact... I'm the one who said them.	Look, Dr. Cox, I've been doing a lot of thinking and I honestly think that the only reason you're not down at that hospital right now is that you're afraid.	That's right!

I'm the one who said them.
I think one of the most universal human experiences is feeling alone. You'd never know it, but there's most likely tons of people feeling the exact same way.Maybe because you're feeling abandoned.Maybe because you realize that you aren't as self-sufficient as you thought.Maybe because you know you should've handled something differently.Or maybe because you aren't as good as you thought you were. Either way, when you hit that low point, you have a choice. You can either wallow in self-pity......Or you can suck it up. It's your call.	No. A patient is a stranger in a bed that you can distance yourself from whenever you need to. Ben is my friend and I'm going to try to get in there to visit him in the next couple of weeks but if I can't... that'll be very sad for me. But really... it will just mean that I'm human. Oh, and newbie? Please don't think that you have come here because Ben needs me. You're here because you're scared to death that you might have to rely on yourself for the first time ever and that... that is just the saddest thing of all.	Look, it boggles my mind that you just bail on a patient!	Geeeet out.
Well, thank God.	Bum bum bum... when criminals in this world appear and break the laws that they should fear / And frighten all who see or hear / The cry goes up both far and near / For Underdog! / Underdog / Underdog / Underdog / Speed of light, roar of thunder / Fight all who rob or plunder / Underdog! / Ahhhh! Underdog! Underdog!	As for me, I decided that if Dr. Cox couldn't do it, well then I would have to be the one there for Ben.	You're mean.
I guess he'll always be a hero to me.	Now unleash the dog of wonder / Tearing evil, spans asunder! / Underdog / Ahhhh, Underdog! / Underdog...	As for Ben, he actually responded to the chemo and went into remission. Hopefully, he won't be back, but who knows? Still, that's not what this story's about.It's about the day I realized that admitting we're not heroic is when we're the most heroic of all.	"Joy... and pain!" Here we go, here we go! "And sunshine..." What else? What else? "And rain!" Cut him up! Cut him up!
You know, I never woulda slept with you if you'd told me you were Dr. Cox's ex-wife.	We could shower together for old time's sake.	I haven't even showered yet.	You find it funny, Dr. Dorian? Why don't you tell me the EKG findings of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome?
Uhhh....	What was that, Newbie?	You know, I never woulda slept with you if you'd told me you were Dr. Cox's ex-wife.	We could shower together for old time's sake.
He likes Carla, anyway.	Relax. He doesn't know.	Uhhh....	What was that, Newbie?
I heard that!	I got Carla wrapped around my finger.	He likes Carla, anyway.	Relax. He doesn't know.
Nothing.	What are you guys talking about?	I heard that!	I got Carla wrapped around my finger.
Forget about it.	Thank you.	Nothing.	What are you guys talking about?
I don't know why my mind is all over the place. Maybe it's because today isn't just any other day; it's my last day as an intern.	I guess I don't fit in with your mirror friends. Enjoy.	All right, enough is enough!Oh!	That's just the kind of thing that can be construed as sexual harassment.You got a few hairs in the sink, there, huh? For God's sake, man, don't comb so hard.
Okay.	Come here!	Nuh-uh.	Haven't I?
Why is he so uptight today?	Despite the fact that when you wake up tomorrow morning you will be a resident, you'll still be the same excitable little girl that you are right now; the only difference will be that some sorry new intern will probably mistake you for somebody who actually knows something.	Okay.	Come here!
Oh, okay.	Hey, Perry.	Why is he so uptight today?	Despite the fact that when you wake up tomorrow morning you will be a resident, you'll still be the same excitable little girl that you are right now; the only difference will be that some sorry new intern will probably mistake you for somebody who actually knows something.
I agree with Laverne!	What?	I wish people would call me "tiger."	Careful, tiger. Careful.
I owe you.	But, J.D., I just	Thank you so much for taking Bober from me.	I was gonna say something, but, it turns out, he gave me a pretty good idea.
Or nothing, I'm on break - let's do it.	Or?	Look, we can stand here and argue all day about who screwed who	Hey, it was J.D.'s patient! I was just the middleman.... -Woman.... -Person.

I was half right.	Yeah. I'll be more than glad to help you, there, Charlotte.	And now, here it comes - the calling me a girl's name, the telling me not to waste my time....	So I thought if you looked at Mr. Bober's chart, and and you agreed with us, you might be able to, you know, pull some strings, er....
Are you dying?	Don't ever be afraid to come to me with stuff like that. The simple fact that you actually seem to give a crap is the reason I took an interest in you to begin with. It's why I trust you as a doctor. Hell, it's...it's why I trust you as a person.	W-well, th thank you!	I was half right.
Aw, just say it.	I've got a new shrink.	Are you dying?	Don't ever be afraid to come to me with stuff like that. The simple fact that you actually seem to give a crap is the reason I took an interest in you to begin with. It's why I trust you as a doctor. Hell, it's...it's why I trust you as a person.
And I just wanna know...if I can buy you dinner.	Oh, no, no, no...no.	You know, Dr. Cox, I wanna thank you for this whole year	Aw, just say it.
Great! I'm off in, like, a half hour	That'd be terrific.	And I just wanna know...if I can buy you dinner.	Oh, no, no, no...no.
Would have been nice.	Oh, no. Here, I was led to believe that you were doing a gift certificate kind of thing. But, to sit and eat...with you, that's-that's just...that's crazy talk! I have half a mind to issue you a drug test. I mean, come on, what'd I sign up for	Great! I'm off in, like, a half hour	That'd be terrific.
Yep. One big, happy family.	I slept with him... and it was good - oh! How's that for stirring things up? Have a great summer, everyone. Bye!	Oh, please God, no.	Carla, my ex-husband is in love with you. It's true. Ask your boyfriend, he knows; he and Perry talk about it all the time. I don't know why you haven't mentioned this to her! Perhaps you're afraid of something? Huh. And Bob? When are you gonna tell Perry that that promotion you're making him jump through hoops for? was filled months ago! It just seems wrong. Which brings us to Twinkie. If you don't have the courage to tell your 'colleague' Dr. Dorian that you're still crazy about him, I'm gonna go ahead and do it for ya, 'cause that's what friends do. Yeah! And finally, Perry, you are not gonna believe what happened the first time I met your little protégé, here....
Yeah, but with the head-to-foot alignment, it's just there's no way for them to lock in.	Dude, either way the naughty bits are still in the middle.	This is unacceptable. You said we were gonna sleep head-to-foot.	Baby, why you have to be so cranky in the morning?
Ugh. I'm not!Ready to go?Morning, boy.	Could you be more homophobic?	Yeah, but with the head-to-foot alignment, it's just there's no way for them to lock in.	Dude, either way the naughty bits are still in the middle.
Rowdy, no.	I can't remember the last time I was in this foul a mood.	Ugh. I'm not!Ready to go?Morning, boy.	Could you be more homophobic?
I'm cool. I'm cool.	Everything's gonna be fine. Okay? Just be cool.	I had my shoes on, it would have been impossible to lock in.	Well, just remember what I said to you this morning in bed.
What?	I can't get to sleep / I think about the implications....	I'm cool. I'm cool.	Everything's gonna be fine. Okay? Just be cool.
Just keep it down.Shh!	Come back another day....	Oh, God!	Night after night my heartbeat shows the fear....Ghosts appear and fade away....
Uhhh....	I can't get to sleep / I think about the implications....Of diving in too deep / And possibly the complications....	Just keep it down.Shh!	Come back another day....
Nightie-night.	Night after night my heartbeat shows the fear....Ghosts appear and fade away.......Ghosts appear and fade away.....	Hey, Elliot....	It's just overkill.Day after day it reappears....
What the hell?	Good morning!	Steady now.... Be brave.... Don't cry.	And just like that, it was my turn to face the music.
Woo!	Dr. Dorian.	What the hell?	Good morning!
Ooh! Is that my new nickname? 'Cause, you know, I actually thought people were gonna start calling me that in high school when I was in our production of 'The Wiz'....Yeah, it was the sort of the "hip" version of 'The Wizard of Oz'.... Nipsey Russell played the TinMan? "Come on and ease on down, ease on down the road!" Remember that? No? Well, anyway, you know, kids can be mean and everyone just started calling me "Dorothy." ...High school was hard....	Here you go, whiz-kid.	Woo!	Dr. Dorian.
Uh...yeah, sir, I have a full patient load; I don't understand that you just drop this guy in my lap and expect me to make him a top priority.	Oh, I'm sorry, sport; I was thinking about soup.

All negative.	Auto-immune serologies?	Who knows.... Maybe he just decided to let the whole ex-wife thing go.	Dr. Cox, I have this, uh, patient, Mr. Zerbo, I can't quite
Negative.	Bone-marrow biopsy?	Then again, maybe he's just letting me stew for a while.	All negative.
Okay, fine: I'm sorry I slept with your ex-wife!	Afraid you got yourself a toughie.	What kind of man tortures people like this!?!	Negative.
It was an accident.	I think I'll sit back down.	Okay, fine: I'm sorry I slept with your ex-wife!	Afraid you got yourself a toughie.
A little scary Sorry! Jitters!	Look.... First of all, it's not like you tripped and fell into her...and then out of her...and then into her...again. And, second of all, you're smart enough to know that I don't want to talk about this; I don't want to know where you did it; I don't even want to know...how it was.	It was an accident.	I think I'll sit back down.
Cool!	Lookit: I know you didn't have any idea who she was, and I understand why you were too nervous to tell me. So, whatta ya say we leave it at that? I forgive you; you are forgiven. Okay?	And here come the fireworks....	A little scary Sorry! Jitters!
Now, she's in a really awkward place; so just be sensitive.	I have no idea how to treat this patient. Help me out.	Oh, for God's sakes, would you throw her a rope?	No.I must have left it at college.
I think we should sex each other.	Now, she's in a really awkward place; so just be sensitive.	I have no idea how to treat this patient. Help me out.	Oh, for God's sakes, would you throw her a rope?
Just hear me out: Our relationship ended so quickly, maybe too quickly, you know? And, now there's like these these feelings floating around, and I feel like we're always gonna regret it if we don't...see if they lead somewhere.What do you think?I can't believe how weird it feels to be back here again.	I'm sorry?	I think we should sex each other.	Now, she's in a really awkward place; so just be sensitive.
If Carla's so mad, I don't understand why she doesn't just crash at her own place.	Yeah.... But it seems so right.	Just hear me out: Our relationship ended so quickly, maybe too quickly, you know? And, now there's like these these feelings floating around, and I feel like we're always gonna regret it if we don't...see if they lead somewhere.What do you think?I can't believe how weird it feels to be back here again.	I'm sorry?
What are you talking about, Willis?	Oh, she is back at her place.	If Carla's so mad, I don't understand why she doesn't just crash at her own place.	Yeah.... But it seems so right.
Yeah, I know.	That's pretty funny!We should make that one of our things.	What are you talking about, Willis?	Oh, she is back at her place.
No.	He hasn't yelled at you?	Yeah. You know what's weird, though? It's like, Dr. Cox and I are pretty vegan-kosher.	I think I'd really panic if she went back to her place.J.D., this sucks.
Mm-mm.	This is the guy that screamed on you for like twenty minutes for dropping a thermometer? And he hasn't raised his voice once about you bumping uglies with his ex-wife?	No.	He hasn't yelled at you?
And that's when I realized something....	I don't get that guy.	Mm-mm.	This is the guy that screamed on you for like twenty minutes for dropping a thermometer? And he hasn't raised his voice once about you bumping uglies with his ex-wife?
Uh...I must have misplaced my pager.	Hey, where you been? I paged you twice.	And that's when I realized something....	I don't get that guy.
...he didn't care about me anymore.	Huh. Probably ought to try and find that.	The reason Dr. Cox wasn't yelling at me like he used to...	Uh...I must have misplaced my pager.
Hey.	Uncool!You look totally hot, Mirror Todd.	Do these help?	This is how The Todd gets his self-esteem on.
You know, Elliot, I think we should talk about the sexual tension	Hey.	Hey.	Uncool!You look totally hot, Mirror Todd.
Awesome!	There is no sexual tension, okay!Just...go ahead and look before your neck snaps.	You know, Elliot, I think we should talk about the sexual tension	Hey.
And the and the sexual tension.	J.D., the problem is this place. I mean, when we broke up, I had to see you the next day...and the next day. And we never...got any distance from the relationship. I never got...to move on, you know?	Awesome!	There is no sexual tension, okay!Just...go ahead and look before your neck snaps.
Whatever. The point is that Turk is sorry.	See? Trust, woman, trust!	And Carla, you're mad that Turk didn't trust you enough to tell you.	You're starting again.
Oh, my God rounds!	I'm going out for Mexican food tonight. And I'll see you in bed, my friend.	Aren't you glad we did this?	Okay, that's it! Now, I have killed for so much less than that, and I'll damn-sure do it again unless you all shut the hell up right now and I MEAN NOW!
Rounds started five minutes ago, and I totally forgot about Mr. Zerbo! Oh, my God...Oh, my God...Oh, my God	The Hall	Oh, my God rounds!	I'm going out for Mexican food tonight. And I'll see you in bed, my friend.
Ow!	Are you plannin' on makin' this worth my while?	Rounds started five minutes ago, and I totally forgot about Mr. Zerbo! Oh, my God...Oh, my God...Oh, my God	The Hall
Think, Whiz Kid, think!Ah, the hell with it.	Dr. Dorian? How 'bout you step up to the mic and tell the entire gang how you ended up treating Mr. Zerbo.	Ow!	Are you plannin' on makin' this worth my while?
Huh?	Great job, sport!	Nothing at all.	You did...nothing?
Clear.	It's short for "Sandra".	You know, "Sandy" isn't necessarily a girls' name.	Sandy, whatta ya say we start our work day.
Oh, God. The ex-wife.	Hello, Perry.	Clear.	It's short for "Sandra".
Ow!	Goodbye, Jordan. Sandy.	No worries.	Don't answer that, Newbie.
You know, it's J.D. Okay? And at least I remember the names of all my sexual partners.	Good job, D.J.	Ow!	Goodbye, Jordan. Sandy.
It was Camp Meadow Wood. ...I made a lanyard.	Well, I'm sure that girl from high school and your bunk-mate from Camp Morning Wood are both extremely grateful. Yeah.	You know, it's J.D. Okay? And at least I remember the names of all my sexual partners.	Good job, D.J.
The frustrating thing was, down in the OR, Turk was probably running the show.	You know, you're right. Would you do me a favor and apologize to her while you get me some coffee. And please be quick, otherwise I'm just gonna have the manager send over a different waitress. Go. You're done now. Yeah.	You know that was...kind of demeaning.	I mean like a glazed thingie. And I like sprinkles on half of it; so if you can't find a half sprinkled, get me all sprinkles and just go ahead and pick half of 'em off.
Or the nurse who everyone agrees is just a little bit off.Or, if there's a full moon....	Hey, bro.	Unfortunately, I'm on-call tonight, and as weird as this place is during the day...it's even worse at night. See, that's when all the weirdos come out.Like the ER doctor who likes to work nights 'cause he says he's up anyway.	Huh? Oh! Oh.... I get it. Neither is Tim.
Ted, I know, you told me last time that we	Hey. This is my band. We all work in different departments in the hospital.	Or the nurse who everyone agrees is just a little bit off.Or, if there's a full moon....	Hey, bro.
Hey. So, what attendings are stuck here on-call tonight?	No, no, no. That was lame. We do prime-time now.	Oh, yeah, I remember, the uh cartoon theme songs.	Dr. Kelso lets us practice here at night.
Oh, come on. You guys are missing the point: No one is here tonight but us, we are running this hospital.	It's disturbing how obsessed you are with your own butt.	Well, I'm "Carol", so yes.	Is Carol the one with the really firm butt?
...And then the next moment, everything changes.	Oh, God. Come on.	It's amazing how one moment you think you know exactly what you want....	I love my butt!
Never actually...done one of these unsupervised before.	Okay, Elliot: The ER doctor knows there's no attending up here, so instead of treating-&-streeting people, he's just admitting everyone. You've got twelve so far.Turk: Oncology, Cardiology, and Pediatrics all need surgical consults...plusThat phone is for you. It's the clinic they, too, know you're on your own so they're just patching all their night calls right on through.And Bambi: Room 201 needs an art-line, Room 202 needs reintubation; plus, Carol, you're needed in ICU to place a femoral swan under flu on Mr. Freed.	...And then the next moment, everything changes.	Oh, God. Come on.
This this isn't like being a janitor, okay! It's not just like something everybody can do.	I owe ya. I'm helping you out.	What are you doing in here?	Want me to knock him out?
YES!	Oh. So you can do my stuff, but I can't do yours.	This this isn't like being a janitor, okay! It's not just like something everybody can do.	I owe ya. I'm helping you out.
I don't know, the...rough side of a sponge?	Okay, hotshot, what would you use to get a coffee stain up off a tile floor?	YES!	Oh. So you can do my stuff, but I can't do yours.
Turk should've known that the worst mistake a doctor can possibly make is setting foot in the hospital's free clinic at night.	Yeah. This ends now.	We'll meet back here in a few hours and see if his vitals have improved.	That's inspiring.
Okay, I want that, then.	You know you could have just asked me to stop hassling you for, like, a year?	Thank God.	Fine. All right, we're even.
But I...use those...for listening.	It's too late.	Okay, I want that, then.	You know you could have just asked me to stop hassling you for, like, a year?
His vitals are exactly the same. There's gotta be one attending in this stupid hospital.	Oh, uh, they want you upstairs in room, um, 208.	But I...use those...for listening.	It's too late.
We all knew what we had to do.	Now I know you're all hoping Officer Berson's vitals will go up or down and this decision will be made for you, but guess what? Nothing's changed. So it's on you.	It's on my to-do list.	You all claim you want more responsibility.... But you're being outsmarted by a doctor who wears scrubs made out of hemp; you're afraid to stand up to a volunteer who's answering the clinic phones; and Bambi, did you ever place that femoral swan?
Sometimes, just making a decision is half the battle.	Surgery.	We all knew what we had to do.	Now I know you're all hoping Officer Berson's vitals will go up or down and this decision will be made for you, but guess what? Nothing's changed. So it's on you.
Even though we all know that tomorrow morning, the three of us'll go back to being the most unappreciated people in the whole damn hospital.	Everything went, uh, really well.	Sometimes, we're our own worst enemy.And sometimes, we rise to the occasion.	Thank you, thank you.
Sass.	Stop saying sass.	Wow. She had some real old-fashioned sass. I mean, you just don't see sass like that anymore.	Careful, there, sweet-cheeks. I haven't decided which way I'm going to take your temperature yet.
Don't get sucked in!	Oh, did you say something, Mr. Too Scared To Get In The Game?	Front butt.... It's like the grail.	Bravo! Bravo!
You broke your penis.	Great, and that means....?	You know, I have an interesting patient, too.So, basically, Mr. Davis, you received a blunt trauma to the fibrous tissue of the corpus cavernosum.	Don't get sucked in!
I-I gotta tell you, it's such an unusual case.... Would you mind if I try and get it published in a medical journal?	Wow. I can't wait to get my cast signed.	You broke your penis.	Great, and that means....?
I'll let you...mull it over. And smile, Mr. Davis - tomorrow's gonna be a better day...for everyone.	That would be fantastic!	I-I gotta tell you, it's such an unusual case.... Would you mind if I try and get it published in a medical journal?	Wow. I can't wait to get my cast signed.
No, seriously, try me I can deal with anything.	Nothin'. Might just veg.	Well, why? What do you have to do?	Uhh, I don't know.
"Go aschmay."	Go away.	No, seriously, try me I can deal with anything.	Nothin'. Might just veg.
Some are so unexpected that everything else takes a back-seat.	Dr. Kelso! Is he gone?	Around here, life can be full of surprises. Some are as simple as forgetting something you were supposed to ask for....	"Eat _schmit_ and die."
I know.	Listen, Newbie, I don't tell you I respect you a lot because, well, I don't.	And some you never thought you'd hear.	I'm getting big, fake breasts.
I'm goin' to Reno! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!	What the hell. Go ahead and use me in your case report.	You see, ten minutes ago....	This is great! There's only one problem.
Not about Reno.	Beg your pardon, Newbie? What are ya thinkin'?	I'm goin' to Reno! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!	What the hell. Go ahead and use me in your case report.
Well, I've only been here a year, and he's actually just started calling me "The Kid" - which I love, by the way.	So, why haven't I heard your name before?	"The kid"? This is great.	Ohh, come on, the kid's okay.
Okay.	She's talking to me, pumpkin.	Well, I've only been here a year, and he's actually just started calling me "The Kid" - which I love, by the way.	So, why haven't I heard your name before?
Well, sir, I	You know, that's what my son always says. But then when Mother's Day rolls around, guess who wants me to go halvsies on a pasta pot for Enid?	Nothing, sir. I don't want anything from you, ever.	And you?
You can't just change your mind!	She's not _my_ mother, dammit!Oh. And don't think that I've forgotten that you have yet to turn in a case report. You have until six.	Well, sir, I	You know, that's what my son always says. But then when Mother's Day rolls around, guess who wants me to go halvsies on a pasta pot for Enid?
Crap.	Oh, I'm sorry. Did I pass out from the pain in my penis and suddenly we're not in America anymore?	You can't just change your mind!	She's not _my_ mother, dammit!Oh. And don't think that I've forgotten that you have yet to turn in a case report. You have until six.
I just had to go for it.	Whole thing's very treatable. We're gonna step outside, and then we'll get underway - how's that sound?Newbie, whatta you say?	And that's when I realized Mrs. Warner was the most interesting case in the hospital.	No.
To marry me.	What?	Actually, if you could just give me a second, I want to ask Mrs. Warner something.	I just had to go for it.
Mrs. Warner, I was wondering if you'd give me permission to present your case to possibly be published in a national medical journal, so that I might be chosen to go to an AMA conference.	Come on - heel, toe - whatta you say, kid?	To marry me.	What?
Thanks.Excuse me.	Sure. Why not.	Mrs. Warner, I was wondering if you'd give me permission to present your case to possibly be published in a national medical journal, so that I might be chosen to go to an AMA conference.	Come on - heel, toe - whatta you say, kid?
And hopefully, you'll land on solid ground	You're the husband? We've gotta get you some bigger hands.	I like to think that your life comes down to the choices you've made along the way.Like standing up to a superior.Or the choice to focus on what you have in common, instead of what you don't.Or the choice to let someone help you, for once.In the end, you just have to trust your decisions.	I know.Look, I wanna be like you...but a more successful you. There's nothing wrong with playing the game once in a while.Tell you what: Ten years form now, when I'm your boss, I'll go ahead and throw in a good word for you and you won't even have to ask........sir.
But you cried!	I like the old one.	Well what about your new mop?!	And hopefully, you'll land on solid ground
Glup.That's a good one.	No, that was you.	But you cried!	I like the old one.
"Eat-may" sounds like "eat me."	What?	We're a team.	That's right.
Clearly we're on the same page.	You know?	Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!	Can you believe that!? I mean, every time we even try to talk to him, he starts going off on one of these random tangents and....
Maybe if you wore your hair up?	We're residents now, we should be treated more like colleagues, and I can't even get him to notice me.Oh, God! Oh! Uh! Sorry, sorry, sorry!	Clearly we're on the same page.	You know?
Let me explain, I	Yes, that's it. I'm a janitor, so I couldn't think of the word "sad." I was gonna say, It makes me feel so "mop."	Sad?	I always get this way in the fall, you know summer's gone, the days are shorter; it just makes me feel so...what's the word....
Maybe I shouldn't bother.	Go ahead, I'm "mopping."	Let me explain, I	Yes, that's it. I'm a janitor, so I couldn't think of the word "sad." I was gonna say, It makes me feel so "mop."
I guess after a while, you just stop being surprised by people.	Maybe you "mopn't."	Maybe I shouldn't bother.	Go ahead, I'm "mopping."
That is adorable. Do you think he'd mind if I call him that, too?	That's my pet-name for Turk you know, 'cause he's mine and he's a black man: "My bruthah."	I didn't know you had a brother.	Oh, cool.
I know. I'm still gonna ask. So, how come I don't know anything about your family?	J.D., I was kidding.	That is adorable. Do you think he'd mind if I call him that, too?	That's my pet-name for Turk you know, 'cause he's mine and he's a black man: "My bruthah."
But you know everything about me. You even know I have them switch Lauren's shifts so we always end up working together.	I don't know. I g I'm just not big on sharing my personal life with people.	I know. I'm still gonna ask. So, how come I don't know anything about your family?	J.D., I was kidding.
Catch you later, my bruthah!	Whatever. I'm out.	Not entirely unlike a...ninja!	I think you should give Bonnie a break. You know, it's really hard being a woman around here...you can walk through walls and nobody notices you.
He said "Holla."	I'll holla.	Catch you later, my bruthah!	Whatever. I'm out.
I think I can handle it.	Okay. You want in? You want me to open up?	Rough day, huh? Well, maybe it would help to share...with someone?	Atta boy.
Wow.	Fine!I don't like the way I look. I don't like the way I think. I don't like the way I feel about how I look. ...I have too much hair, my boobs are too low, my butt is too big, and I'm so short!Plus, when I work up this morning, I cried for like half an hour because I thought I was getting wrinkles, but it turns out I just fell asleep on Turk's corduroy pants!	I think I can handle it.	Okay. You want in? You want me to open up?
He's not! That's his "In your face" dance.... Or it's his "There's a sale on lotion" dance. I dunno; he's got so many dances.	Then why is he doing his "You're so getting a piece of this" dance?	What, Turk and Bonnie? They hate each other.	You see, that's what's really bothering me.
Carla! Trust me, there's no way that he's cheating on you.	Please, they might as well be naked. Slut.	He's not! That's his "In your face" dance.... Or it's his "There's a sale on lotion" dance. I dunno; he's got so many dances.	Then why is he doing his "You're so getting a piece of this" dance?
Wait, that's it? You were just freakin' out.	Yeah, you're probably right.	Carla! Trust me, there's no way that he's cheating on you.	Please, they might as well be naked. Slut.
Crazy!	Hey, you wanted in!	Wait, that's it? You were just freakin' out.	Yeah, you're probably right.
What's wrong with him?	A lot happens in the cafeteria.... Whether you've just accidentally stolen your lunch....Or you've finally gotten someone to notice you....Or you've connected with a friend on a level you didn't know you could.The cafeteria is just a happy place.	Oh, thank God.	J.D.!
A little can...a very tiny, small can.	J.D. said you're a big ol' can o' crazy.	Hey, when did you guys learn sign language!?Night classes? Wait, when did _I_ learn sign language?	Mm-hmm.
Ah, thank you!	Bambi. We're good, okay? We're pals!	Carla, look, I messed up and I'm so sorry.	Okay, you can fix this.
Well, don't walk away! Carla...come on.	I told you how hard it is for me to let my guard down, and that quick, you burn me. Never again.	Come on....	You think this is funny?
Quiet; this isn't about you! Don't eat meat!Carla! Look, every time you screwed up with me, I've totally let you off the hook.	Thanks, man.	Will you lay off Mr. Hogan? So he made a mistake, all right, people make mistakes. When they do, it wouldn't hurt you to cut them some slack once in a while.	That's it, I've I've had enough. This is ridiculous.
Okay, never. But we both know that if you ever did, I would give you a break. Now let's see how you like it when I walk away from you.Actually, I need to go this way.Right the first time.	When have I ever screwed up with you?	Quiet; this isn't about you! Don't eat meat!Carla! Look, every time you screwed up with me, I've totally let you off the hook.	Thanks, man.
Really?	I spoke to my brother today.	I think every day is made up of tiny little tests.Some are tests of character.Some are tests of fortitude.Others are tests of friendship.	Barbie, as long as you stay and work at this hospital, I'm always gonna be your superior.... That's just the way it goes. Don't get me wrong, you can keep trying to connect with me; I mean, hell, you're...you're so damn entertaining you just might make some head-way. But still, you might be better served and, this is a crazy notion if you could stop worrying so much about who does and doesn't notice...you. Even for a second...that'd be good; that'd be real good.
And if you're lucky, when it really matters, you'll pass with flying colors.	Mm-hmm. He's having some problems.	Really?	I spoke to my brother today.
Well, I look doctorly!	Look, Babs, if you're truly worried about people seeing your ass, just go ahead and do what all the other girls do and tie a sweater around your waist.	'Cause I'm a doctor.	Why...in the hell are you wearing a coat?
Coat-wearing doctors do not take this crap.	If I find out you're wearing a bronzie, without having served, I'm gonna make things uncomfortable for you.	Where did you come from!?	I was in the military.
Which branch?	Yes, I was.	You were never in the military.	Coat-wearing doctors do not take this crap.
I'm watching you.That's right, Sasquatch.	The...janitor branch.	Which branch?	Yes, I was.
I think I look spiffy. I'm trying to separate myself from the whole pack.	Dude, you are such a loser, man.	Most importantly, we've started to treat each other with respect.	Ohhh, sweet baby James.
I ain't hearin' that, woman, 'cause I'm talkin' to him.	Oh, come on, J.D.'s white!	Yeah, you are.	The whitest.
T. Diddy?	Okay, it's a tie.	I ain't hearin' that, woman, 'cause I'm talkin' to him.	Oh, come on, J.D.'s white!
And then, I did something I've never done before....	Listen closely, Tiny Dancer: I wouldn't be flapping my mouth if I'd forgotten to get a blood culture on Mr. Blair. And, for the love of God, do you at least remember what you were doing the day they were passing out common sense? Oh, gosh, maybe you were running late that day 'cause you just couldn't find the right thong for those low-rider jeans that you love so much, or maybe you were busy bopping along to whatever boy band really makes your heart race nowadays, and you just drove on by. 'Course, I don't know, I'm just guessing, but one things' sure-shootin': you wound up at the dumb-dumb store and you just went ahead and put so much of that into the car that you could fit, didn't ya?	Idiot! I wish I had a guy in my life that would stop me before I did something stupid.I don't know why he's an opera singer.	Think you really got through to him.Oh, my God, you hear like a bat!
"Buster Brown."	"Buster Brown."	Look, Doctor: If you flip the page on that chart, you'd see that I pan-cultured him yesterday; but that would probably get in the way of the perverse pleasure you take in pointing out other peoples' slip-ups. Well, too bad, Buster Brown! Because I'm a resident now, and I'm not gonna be making the same little silly intern mistakes I made last year. I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't stand here and yell at me in front of my patient.	And then, I did something I've never done before....
You know, you guys are getting to be like Starsky and Hutch.	I don't know, dude.	Domo arigato, Dr. Amato.How is that not funny?	Oh, that's great, Dr. Amato.
I would watch that show.	That'd be true if Starsky was a ventriloquist and Hutch was a tiny puppet.	You know, you guys are getting to be like Starsky and Hutch.	I don't know, dude.
Why do you keep ending up with that guy?	Yeah.	I would watch that show.	That'd be true if Starsky was a ventriloquist and Hutch was a tiny puppet.
Oh, what, ending up with Dr. Amato is like a punishment or something?	Because the other surgeons are busting my chops for skipping guys' night out.	Why do you keep ending up with that guy?	Yeah.
Check that out.	No, dude; I actually enjoy needing you to lower me on the toilet in the morning.	Oh, what, ending up with Dr. Amato is like a punishment or something?	Because the other surgeons are busting my chops for skipping guys' night out.
Mmm?	I know it looks innocent, but Elliot was late this morning. Plus, once you've been here a while, you learn to read between the lines.	Check that out.	No, dude; I actually enjoy needing you to lower me on the toilet in the morning.
I'm gonna tell you something my mom used to tell me whenever I was scared: In the case of severe sinus infection not responding to a three-day cycle of antibiotics, the recommended protocol is Imipenem, 500 milligrams, I.V.q. six hours. Got me through a lot of hard times.	But I'm feeling a lot better.	Mr. Blair, that infection keeps hanging around so I wanna put you on a broader spectrum antibiotic that we'll administer intravenously.	Not enough.
You can't wear that!	How's it goin'?	I love it that Mr. Blair trusted me. It's one of the best feelings you can have as a doctor.	I'm gonna tell you something my mom used to tell me whenever I was scared: In the case of severe sinus infection not responding to a three-day cycle of antibiotics, the recommended protocol is Imipenem, 500 milligrams, I.V.q. six hours. Got me through a lot of hard times.
You know what I mean!	What, you mean after Labor Day? Eh.	You can't wear that!	How's it goin'?
Jerk!	It's a white coat. Anybody can wear a white coat.	You know what I mean!	What, you mean after Labor Day? Eh.
Bye, Turk!!!	I'm just as cool as those guys.	I don't care what hospital you go to, Surgery is still a boys' club.	Okay, I'd watch that.What's up, fellas!
'Course it's temporary. It could also be slightly more un-temporary.	This is only temporary, right?	Whoa; nobody needs to go call Dr. Cox.	I'm calling Dr. Cox.
Just when you think you have this place figured out, it finds a new way to get you.	You mean "permanent."	'Course it's temporary. It could also be slightly more un-temporary.	This is only temporary, right?
Ted, I don't I don't have the nose. Maybe you should just calm down.	Kelso's gonna blame me. Just...get rid of the nose!	No, I-I just gave him I.V. Imipenem.	Oh, God, you cut off someone's nose!? Where is it? Do you have it on you? You're disgusting!
My bad.	MAYBE _YOU_ SHOULD CALM DOWN!	Ted, I don't I don't have the nose. Maybe you should just calm down.	Kelso's gonna blame me. Just...get rid of the nose!
Great. Thank you, Ted.	Imipenem...Imipenem...Imipenem...."Unlike Gentamicin and Tetracycline, Imipenem has never been associated with anosmia." My God, we're okay. We're okay.	My bad.	MAYBE _YOU_ SHOULD CALM DOWN!
What?	It's...my birthday.	Great. Thank you, Ted.	Imipenem...Imipenem...Imipenem...."Unlike Gentamicin and Tetracycline, Imipenem has never been associated with anosmia." My God, we're okay. We're okay.
kinda.	Here you've put me in a tough situation: I can't honestly decide whether to say, "Duh," uh, "Doy," or a very sarcastic, "Oh, really?" My God, Fiona, I know it wasn't your fault; hell, the patient probably knows! But he seemed a little distraught, like maybe being able to blame somebody for a second or two just might make him feel a little better? And, I know, maybe it's me, but doesn't that seem like something that goes right along with wearing that fancy white coat? It...does, doesn't it.	Anosmia isn't a side-effect of I.V. Imipenem. Plus, Mr. Blair had multiple nasal polypectomies, and septoplasty; and his loss of smell is most likely caused by repeated manipulation of the sinuses along with concurrent infection. So, I didn't make a mistake; and you were wrong when you said, "Nice goin', Newbie."	I beg your pardon?
"Woof"?	Gosh, I'm so proud of ya. Put her there.Woof.	kinda.	Here you've put me in a tough situation: I can't honestly decide whether to say, "Duh," uh, "Doy," or a very sarcastic, "Oh, really?" My God, Fiona, I know it wasn't your fault; hell, the patient probably knows! But he seemed a little distraught, like maybe being able to blame somebody for a second or two just might make him feel a little better? And, I know, maybe it's me, but doesn't that seem like something that goes right along with wearing that fancy white coat? It...does, doesn't it.
Good luck.	It's all right.	Oh, Mr. Blair, I just wanted to say again that I made a mistake, and I'm sorry.	For me, it was when I stopped worrying about how other people saw me that I finally started to look better.
Laverne! Careful.	Come on, baby. Let's see if we can find you a ride.	Good luck.	It's all right.
Well, you know, maybe tomorrow, I'll get a bad hair-cut and push around a mop all day!I know you don't have to do it, okay?Yeah.	Oh, so we're done with the coats?? All right. Well, it was a fun day, though, wasn't it? See you tomorrow.	Laverne! Careful.	Come on, baby. Let's see if we can find you a ride.
Give me some!	Bubbles?	Oh, I may take a bath first.	Yeah, pretty much.
What the hell are you doing here!?	Arrgghh! Hey-hey-hey, little brother! It's the head-lockin' Dan!	It was sad, 'cause I started to think I'd never feel like a kid again.	Give me some!
Dr. Cox, this is my big brother, Dan! He just showed up unexpected!	You know, it's funny, Vivian, I was just going to ask you the exact same question, seeing as how I paged you four minutes and thirty-eight seconds ago.	What the hell are you doing here!?	Arrgghh! Hey-hey-hey, little brother! It's the head-lockin' Dan!
Well, you know, it's a term of endearment that only Carla uses.	Bambi?	Maybe he'll let that go....	Oh. Plus, you get to hang out with Bambi!
I can't let you tell him!	I can totally be a doctor.	What?	Let me do it.
Stop your stupid laughing! It makes you look like a whore!Jokin'! Heh.	That is	You know, it's nice when your friends and family click. It makes you feel likeWait a second, is she still laughing?	You know I think it's sexy to dance with a woman who can lift her partner over her head.
Ohh, I'm not gonna mess with that hostess. You know, she uses sharp tones.	So call and change it to three.	Yeah, I...well, you know, I would've invited you, but I already made the reservation for two.	So, uh, you going to lunch with your brother?
Because I need special time with my brother! Argh!	Heh, yeah right. Now, I'll give you three seconds to give me the real reason I can't go to lunch, otherwise I'm coming.Three...two...one.	Ohh, I'm not gonna mess with that hostess. You know, she uses sharp tones.	So call and change it to three.
Excuse me?	Trick.	Because I need special time with my brother! Argh!	Heh, yeah right. Now, I'll give you three seconds to give me the real reason I can't go to lunch, otherwise I'm coming.Three...two...one.
Whatever.	I just figure you gotta be wondering, "Am I gonna get a trick, or am I gonna get a treat?" You'll be getting a trick.	Excuse me?	Trick.
You just told me it was gonna be you.	It'll be fast, and you won't even know it's me.	Whatever.	I just figure you gotta be wondering, "Am I gonna get a trick, or am I gonna get a treat?" You'll be getting a trick.
False alarm, boys.	You'll still have your doubts.And the best part is, you're gonna be nervous all day about it, 'cause it could happen at any time!That wasn't it. Fun, though!	You just told me it was gonna be you.	It'll be fast, and you won't even know it's me.
All right, you know, fine. A-ask me if she could be better!What? Thirsty!	What? I was thirsty.	Hey!	'Kay, if he tries hard but there's room for improvement, take a sip of your drink.
Dan's doing great.	And that's when I realized that even though I was a little jealous, that's not why I was trying to keep Elliot and Dan apart.	Well, Dan, you don't _stay with her_. I mean, come on, it it it he's not like Greg Brady living in the attic with beads for a door. I mean...he totally has his own space. More like...uh, Kirk Cameron in the last season of 'Growing Pains', when he lived above the garage with Boner? Anyone? Am I the only one? Boner? ...No?	Yeah, I kinda take care of my mom's place, so she lets me stay with her.
...The real reason was that I was ashamed of my brother. And I think he knew it, too.	Dan's doing great.	And that's when I realized that even though I was a little jealous, that's not why I was trying to keep Elliot and Dan apart.	Well, Dan, you don't _stay with her_.

No...why?Oh, God! Oh, please tell me that......that was the horn!	So, can you work the windows from back there?	Somehow I knew my brother would handle this the way he always did when there was a deep emotional conflict between us.	Not if I see you first.
Oh, God! It's everywhere!	There's your heated seat, my friend.	No...why?Oh, God! Oh, please tell me that......that was the horn!	So, can you work the windows from back there?
Well, then, why'd you knock the folder out of my hand?!	No, it's not me.	A gorilla....	There's someone running around in a gorilla suit? What's he look like?
I didn't ask you to do that!	Because you asked me to. Here you go.	Well, then, why'd you knock the folder out of my hand?!	No, it's not me.
Dr. Kelso, I	I don't have time to stand here and flirt, son. There have been rumblings that you let your brother play doctor the other day.	Oh, good, sir.	Hey, sport, how you doin'?
Sir, I don't follow.	Dr. Dorian, if I had one shred of evidence that incident actually took place, you would be working with my nephew Francis so fast, it'd make your head spin!	Dr. Kelso, I	I don't have time to stand here and flirt, son. There have been rumblings that you let your brother play doctor the other day.
Not _inside_, no.	He cleans pools! I forgot you didn't know that! Well, anyway, I trust we will not be seeing your brother in the hospital again!	Sir, I don't follow.	Dr. Dorian, if I had one shred of evidence that incident actually took place, you would be working with my nephew Francis so fast, it'd make your head spin!
Elliot! Come on! What does she expect us to talk about?	'Kay, you know what, forget it.	Yeah! Those were awesome!	Dude, remember the cans on Pat Clark's mom?
Oh, yeah....	I don't know.... Maybe the fact that you're so embarrassed by me that you make excuses to your friends about how I live my life.	Elliot! Come on! What does she expect us to talk about?	'Kay, you know what, forget it.
Dan....	What can I say? It's been a real pleasure seeing you.	That's a load of crap.Look, I know you, okay. I know the reason you wanted to pretend you're a doctor yesterday is 'cause you hate working in that bar and you wanted to feel like somebody for once. Come on, man, you're not you're not driving that car across the country for the three hundred dollars you're doing it 'cause you like the way you feel when you drive it. And the funny thing is, you could be that guy, but you're afraid that if if you actually have to try at something you might fail, and that's just not a chance you're willing to take.	And now for the apology.
I'd let her to blow my house down, you know what I'm sayin'!	Dude, that girl in the wolf outfit is totally checking you out!	Right then, I knew I'd never see my brother the same way again.You can never let go of the kid inside of you.	Dan....
You see, it's the kid inside of us that keeps us all from going crazy.	...a cashew!	I'd let her to blow my house down, you know what I'm sayin'!	Dude, that girl in the wolf outfit is totally checking you out!
Oh, please. I lived for danger.	Oh, gosh, Martha, I'd love to attend your safety camp this summer I would but here my parents are making me go to Maine with them. So whatta you say you make sure and take a lot of pictures, that way, when you get back, we can both sit down and put together a "Friends Forever" collage. Come on, now, the kid's sixteen years old he's a little busted up, it's not that big a deal. I mean, hell, when...when you were a kid, you must've cut your hand on your doll house?	Okay; okay, Mike, that's all that matters.Victor.... Ohhhhh....Victoria!I mean, the kid thinks he's Evil Knievel	Look, I-I get it, okay.
I had...four different helmets.	Who's ready for some frisbee!Get my mom! Get my mom!	Oh, please. I lived for danger.

I usually don't walk away from Dr. Cox, but today's the day the pharmaceutical reps show up to peddle their new drugs. And, at Sacred Heart, that means one thing: Julie's here.	Lookit, I don't have time right now to be the hundred-watt bulb for your annoying little moth, so if you could just fly away, that'd be great. Just fly awa hey....?	I had...four different helmets.	Who's ready for some frisbee!Get my mom! Get my mom!
Steady.... Easy, now.... You're almost...there!	Well, go ahead, take it.	No.... I'd _love_ one.	You're cute! Would you like a pen?
Except that. And...that. And now that. And that and that and that. It just keeps on going!	You just did.	What? I am not gonna say a word.	Well, yes it does. But, here, that's what makes it delicious.
I gotta get back to work.	No, no, no; I think you're right. From now on, before I do anything, I'll make sure to run it by you first. Permission to go see my kid's attempt to overcome his crippling shyness by appearing in his fourth grade class's production of "Town Without A Turkey"?	No. N-n-no no catchies.	You know, I just wanted to, uh, sneak out for an hour, and see my kid's fourth grade play. But, you caught me!
What just happened!?!	"Back to work..." Message received.	I gotta get back to work.	No, no, no; I think you're right. From now on, before I do anything, I'll make sure to run it by you first. Permission to go see my kid's attempt to overcome his crippling shyness by appearing in his fourth grade class's production of "Town Without A Turkey"?
Please, I never do this....	Yes you do. Every time you stare off in to space like this.......I know you're just thinking of something you're too afraid to say.	No I don't.	Well, I do have better bed-side manner.... I anticipate problems way ahead of time.... Oh, and my hair never gets in my face; so yes, yes I do!
There are a lot of things that can take you by surprise.Sometimes, it's just realizing that you're not as happy as you thought.Sometimes, it's a hot chick smacking her tushie.And sometimes, it's when you take a chance...and lose.	Mrs. Kahn died on the operating table.	Buy a cup!Hey. What's wrong?	Oh, God.See ya, geek!
This is a crucial moment. Pick your words carefully.	This just sucks.... You know?	There are a lot of things that can take you by surprise.Sometimes, it's just realizing that you're not as happy as you thought.Sometimes, it's a hot chick smacking her tushie.And sometimes, it's when you take a chance...and lose.	Mrs. Kahn died on the operating table.
And here comes the crushing blow!	I believe we all have a lesson to learn from Dr. Reid's case....	He's like a royal python torturing a hopper mouse. ...Man, I love Animal Planet.	Dr. Reid faced a very difficult decision. And she chose an extremely risky course.
Whattos to who?	...I say, kudos to Dr. Reid.	And here comes the crushing blow!	I believe we all have a lesson to learn from Dr. Reid's case....
What?	Come here!	The point is, Kelso's right; you know? It's not even just professionally in my personal life, I don't take any chances, either. I want to, I just...I can never seem to take that first step.	Well, if it makes you feel any better, she has a snaggletooth.
Where are we going? I don't I don't want to go anywhere. I want to spend time with Snaggletooth!	Come on!	What?	Come here!
I guess it all comes down to what we're willing to risk.For some of us, it's our feelings....	Nooo.	Where are we going? I don't I don't want to go anywhere. I want to spend time with Snaggletooth!	Come on!
I don't wanna do it.	Dude, you're gonna love this!	For me, it was taking a risk, period. Even if that meant starting with my very first step.	I know, Buppy. I know.
We could die!	Come on, what's the worst that could happen?	I don't wanna do it.	Dude, you're gonna love this!
Can't we just go back and talk to Snaggletooth?!	Okay, the second worst?	We could die!	Come on, what's the worst that could happen?
Morning.	Hey, there, Sunshine!	....that's just gravy.Yep, there's nothing like mornings at home!	I'll live.
Well, what about that guy taking scrubs?	There's been several thefts around the hospital. We're doing bag checks.	Why?	Hold up.
Of course, if he was checking my trunk....	Yeah? Ah-ha!	Well, go ahead, narc. I'm clean.	He doesn't have a bag.
I'm just saying, if I had to get three by lunch, I probably could.	You really pick odd things to brag about.	Twice this morning, and I haven't even had my coffee yet.	Well, I haven't pooed in six days.
Obstetrics and Gynecology is a specialty that's usually dominated by women.	Hey, guys. Gyno Girls, twelve o'clock.	I'm just saying, if I had to get three by lunch, I probably could.	You really pick odd things to brag about.
Being a Gyno Girl is a lot like being in a sorority.	Dr. Reid? I'm Dr. Gerson. We were just wondering if you have any thoughts about your specialty? Because we really think you're OB-GYN material.	Obstetrics and Gynecology is a specialty that's usually dominated by women.	Hey, guys. Gyno Girls, twelve o'clock.
Ah, just gimme a second, I'm figuring something out for a patient.	J.D.! I can't go with Dr. Gerson because I have to help you...right?	Being a Gyno Girl is a lot like being in a sorority.	Dr. Reid? I'm Dr. Gerson. We were just wondering if you have any thoughts about your specialty? Because we really think you're OB-GYN material.
Dammit!	I'm glad we all finally experimented with each other...but I'll never do it again.	Ah, just gimme a second, I'm figuring something out for a patient.	J.D.! I can't go with Dr. Gerson because I have to help you...right?
Oh? Well, that's good.	You know, we're zeroing in on the guy that's been stealing stuff.	Luckily for Turk, revenge is a dish best served cold.... Not unlike this tapioca pudding.	_Three_ hundred?
Really?	Yep. In fact, right now, I'm dusting for fingerprints.	Oh? Well, that's good.	You know, we're zeroing in on the guy that's been stealing stuff.
Then maybe it's because I told her that you smoke the ganja.	Yeah, "Marcia Gets Creamed" Season Five, Episode Three. Don't _ever_ question me on The Bunch. Besides, there's no way they liked you better than me.	You know, when Marcia was working at the ice cream shop, and then she got Jan a job, and they liked Jan better, so they fired Marcia.	What?
Where're you going? Munchies?	What!? That that's not even true! You're a jackass!	Then maybe it's because I told her that you smoke the ganja.	Yeah, "Marcia Gets Creamed" Season Five, Episode Three. Don't _ever_ question me on The Bunch. Besides, there's no way they liked you better than me.
Oh, quit being such a baby.	I'm not talking to you. ....And, yes.	That is so cool! Did they let you run the siren?	Yeah, I know, but I...freakin' caught a E.M.T. shift, and I was riding around in an ambulance all night.
You stole my money!	"Bab " You stole my job!	Oh, quit being such a baby.	I'm not talking to you. ....And, yes.
Oh, yeah? Well find this!	That was a _finder's fee_!	You stole my money!	"Bab " You stole my job!
Wouldn't that hurt?	You know, you're supposed to grab your crotch when you say that.	Oh, yeah? Well find this!	That was a _finder's fee_!
Stay low.	Help me, or we go check out the trunk of your car.	You can't just take a computer.	Hey, idiot.Heh, I said "idiot" and you looked. Hey, help me carry this computer into my van.
Carla. She said "we" "We need to scrape some money together." And it wasn't just like a "we're dating" we; it was just like a "we're gonna spend the rest of our lives together" we. I don't know, man, that that just seems big to me, you know?	What?	She said "we."	What the hell are you doing in here?
Can I run the siren?	Yeah, I know.	Carla. She said "we" "We need to scrape some money together." And it wasn't just like a "we're dating" we; it was just like a "we're gonna spend the rest of our lives together" we. I don't know, man, that that just seems big to me, you know?	What?
I usually don't like thinking about the future. I mean, let's face it, you can't predict what's gonna happen.But sometimes, the thing you didn't expect is what you really wanted after all.Maybe the best thing to do is just stop trying to figure out where you're going, and just enjoy where you're at.	I was gonna, man. I was gonna.	Ah, forget about it. You can keep the hundred bucks.	Sorry I ripped you off.
Oh, God, that's good.	As bad as things were going for Elliot...	This pear is delicious!Need help packing?	Lately, I just feel like I'm drowning, you know?
...they were going pretty well for me.	Oh, God, that's good.	As bad as things were going for Elliot...	This pear is delicious!Need help packing?
Uhhhh, actually, Dr. Cox, I was watching TV last night, and they had this special on flesh-eating bacteria....	I guarantee you, that's a simple case of cellulitis right there.	...they were going pretty well for me.	Oh, God, that's good.
Yeah, I think they called it "flesh-eating bacteria" to sound more flashy — you know, hook in all the idiots.	Necrotizing fasciitis; yeeeesss?	Uhhhh, actually, Dr. Cox, I was watching TV last night, and they had this special on flesh-eating bacteria....	I guarantee you, that's a simple case of cellulitis right there.
Anyhoo, point being, uh, they said it was very easy to confuse, uh, cellulitis with chompers...."Chompers" was the — the animated flesh-eating bacteria that — that narrated the special.	Apparently it worked.	Yeah, I think they called it "flesh-eating bacteria" to sound more flashy — you know, hook in all the idiots.	Necrotizing fasciitis; yeeeesss?
Come on, trust yourself.	Look, Britney, recently I made the potentially fatal mistake of getting back together with my ex-wife, who, angel that she is, is carrying the spawn of another man's seed. So forgive me if I sound a tad irritable when I tell you, I don't care what piece of irrelevant drivel you picked off TV while you were snuggled up in your Holly Hobbie P.J.s.	Anyhoo, point being, uh, they said it was very easy to confuse, uh, cellulitis with chompers...."Chompers" was the — the animated flesh-eating bacteria that — that narrated the special.	Apparently it worked.
Thank you, sir.	And yet, they didn't. The student becomes the teacher, eh, Perry? Haha... warms my heart.	Bah, it's nothing, sir. Anyone coulda made that call.	Brilliant! Necrotizing fasciitis! That's a one in a million diagnosis, son! One in a million!
Do you want it?	Cool, a coin.	Well, definitely top two.What's that I see in your ear...? Pa-ZOW!	Holy crap, it's David Copperfield!
No, top three. Top three.	Here, you take it.Haw-haw! Magic!	Do you want it?	Cool, a coin.
Grr!	There's Mr. Flesh-Eating Bacteria!	You!	Great diagnosis!
Ah! Sure. "To my two biggest fans."	Doctor. Could you sign these, please?	Grr!	There's Mr. Flesh-Eating Bacteria!
I — I know... I'm a doctor.	Yeah. They're called breasts.	Ah! Sure. "To my two biggest fans."	Doctor. Could you sign these, please?
First of all, in your face, because it was Friday night; and secondly, I woulda made the catch regardless — you see, if you use your head and do some homework, medicine is just... it's basically science!	You know, Eunice, you never even woulda made that catch if you weren't such an all-purpose nerd, sitting home alone on a Saturday night, watching some medical special on TV!	I — I know... I'm a doctor.	Yeah. They're called breasts.
Look, Elliot, my dad's an office supplies salesman. A bad one. So things were a little different for me, growing up.	Well, I may have told her that she spends more money dying her roots than I do on groceries. Still, this whole thing is just as much her fault as it is my father's — neither one of them prepared me for this.	Just like that?	You know, I called my mom today, to see if she could convince my dad to send some cash, right? She says I should try and think of this whole thing as some kind of opportunity, and then she hung up on me!
Great.	See, this is a bicycle bell. Now, you hold on to this, because I'm gonna give you a different part every year. Maybe after the party, we can take it out for a spin!

Still waiting on that kick-stand.	'Kay?	Great.	See, this is a bicycle bell. Now, you hold on to this, because I'm gonna give you a different part every year. Maybe after the party, we can take it out for a spin!
Well, believe what you want to believe. I'll do it again.	Look who peeked in his shorts and found a pair! What are you, feeling like you finally took on the old man in a game of one-on-one and kicked his ass? Well, here's the news-flash, there, Skeetch: It was a fluke!	Oh, are you too busy eating sour grapes?	I say we let Super Doc here take 'em.
Please. I know all there is to know about thrombotic... thrombo... cyto — cytop-top-top-top... toppee— toppee—	All right, fair enough, here's your chance — two identical patients. I say we divide 'em up, just like in The Parent Trap. One goes with the sexy, free-wheeling, bachelor dad — hello. The other goes with the whiny, neurotic, sexually repressed mom — oh, just you all over.Oh, and I checked tonight's TV listings — there is no special on that disease, so you're gonna want to stop at the Blockbuster.	Well, believe what you want to believe. I'll do it again.	Look who peeked in his shorts and found a pair! What are you, feeling like you finally took on the old man in a game of one-on-one and kicked his ass? Well, here's the news-flash, there, Skeetch: It was a fluke!
Oh, no.	I'd stay and talk you through this, but I gotta go check on my patient; you see, he's still alive.	What?	Boy, that's tough.
Go ahead, walk away! Because I'm not gonna obsess about this!Can you put a rush on this autopsy? I gotta figure this out.You got some crumbs in his hair.	Well, then, have it your way, there, Carol. 'Cause I'm out.Good luck, everyone.	You know what, I've been working my ass off here for the last year and a half, and the last thing I need is another one of your condescending, never-ending speeches where you spoon-feed me some giant lesson and call me a girl's name.	For whatever reason, I was finally fed up.
What?!	How about, "Go to hell, Shakira."	Sure! Hit me.	Can I? Really?
Why do you always have to be like that? You know that I try harder than anyone in this place, and you never give me any credit!	What, now that you've decided you're ready to listen, how does it work, huh? You gonna pull a string on my back? Well, step right up and give it a tug. But, I'm warning you, I bet it keeps coming up "Go to hell, Shakira."	What?!	How about, "Go to hell, Shakira."
Thanks for your help.	Now, you listen to me, Newbie. I'm not doing this because I get my jollies off of being your mentor, and I'm damn sure not doing it so that years from now I can say, "Boy, I knew him when." I'm doing it because if I don't, people would die.	Why do you always have to be like that? You know that I try harder than anyone in this place, and you never give me any credit!

But, I'm warning you, I bet it keeps coming up "Go to hell, Shakira."
What?	It was luck.	As I sat there, still searching for answers about my patient, I realized that I still needed Dr. Cox. It's hard to face a harsh truth about yourself.I guess the only thing you can do is try to take positive steps.Unfortunately, it's hard to take positive steps when you've burned the bridge you need to walk across.	Yeah, you will. But with me, it's okay, because I love you.Besides, I barely listen, anyway.Come on, Rowdy! Let's go, boy! Let's hit up the fourth floor.Whoa, whoa, boy! Whoa! Slow down!
Thanks.	The thing that you forgot? Turns out, whatever you know about medicine, ultimately, luck or fate or God or... who knows what is always gonna end up playing a much bigger role in the whole thing than you and I ever will. Hell, it was lucky you were watching that show the other night. And it was unlucky that your patient went the other way, even though you did absolutely everything right; and, for the record, you did. I was looking over your shoulder every step of the way.	What?	It was luck.
Mission accomplished.	Baby, it was dark, and he/she had a body that was rockin'!	Once, on a red-eye flight, Turk groped a trans-sexual.	Okay, just subtly take the spotlight off yourself.
Okay! So I'm in a bit of a dry spell.... I have no idea what to do with myself.	We're talking about you right now, studly.	Mission accomplished.	Baby, it was dark, and he/she had a body that was rockin'!
Please! I'm a young, single player with a heart of gold. I should be able to stir something up.How _do_ you get so dirty?...Rowdy!	Why don't you give Rowdy a bath he smells a little ripe.	Okay! So I'm in a bit of a dry spell.... I have no idea what to do with myself.	We're talking about you right now, studly.
At least you're pretty.	My life is a mess!	I'm not the only one in a rut.	Please! I'm a young, single player with a heart of gold. I should be able to stir something up.How _do_ you get so dirty?...Rowdy!
Whatever. Dry spell, prepare to be moistened!	Okay, boys, remember, now: When we get upstairs, it's the trauma ward, not the "drama ward," so smiles, everyone. Smiles.	The monster kills everything that's beautiful. Everything! ....Except Lisa, the Gift Shop girl!	Ha! Well.... Put it in your pocket and save it for later!
Free gum No! You know, I was just thinking, you're probably one of those girls that's so pretty that no one ever has the courage to ask you out.	J.D., I can't give you free gum.	Hey, Lisa! How you doin'?	Whatever. Dry spell, prepare to be moistened!
Okay, momentary set-back. Regroup. Regroup!	No, I get asked out all the time.	Free gum No! You know, I was just thinking, you're probably one of those girls that's so pretty that no one ever has the courage to ask you out.	J.D., I can't give you free gum.
Ohh, I could think of a couple things....	So...what did you have in mind?	Very funny, you dumb choir punks! Santa's a drunk! Where were we?	Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Who the hell cares.	How _does_ he get so dirty?	Ohh, I could think of a couple things....	So...what did you have in mind?
I swear on all the gifts in her shop, I will make you proud.	Hey, look at me. I want you to turn Gift Shop Girl into Gift Shop Woman.	Hold me down! Know what I'm sayin'?	Hey, it was a pleasure meeting you, Lisa.YO!Yeah! Gift Shop Girl! Player!
Fine.	I am so tired of everyone always thinking that I need to be rescued! Okay, J.D.?	Why don't you just crash with me and Turk till you find a place?	I am so screwed! I had to move out of my apartment this morning all of my stuff is outside in a truck.
Yeah, I'm trying it out. I find, with the ladies, if you're clear with your intentions right off the bat, they just fall in to place. A.Q.?	"Perry"?	You know, Perry	Well, for starters, you should probably go ahead and thank your lucky stars that you finally found a gal who's into same-sex relationships.
"A.Q." is sort of a new, hip expression means "Any questions?"	What!?	Yeah, I'm trying it out. I find, with the ladies, if you're clear with your intentions right off the bat, they just fall in to place. A.Q.?	"Perry"?
Oh, come on, I am so in.	So you think you're in, huh?	That little guy earned his money tonight.	Oh!
No, I feel pretty good about it. You want me.	Come on, you can't be sure.	Oh, come on, I am so in.	So you think you're in, huh?
Uh, yeah, I'm a doctor; all the symptoms are there you do.	I don't!	No, I feel pretty good about it. You want me.	Come on, you can't be sure.
Whoa. Heh. Uh.... You know, I thought I had to sneeze, but it was a false alarm. Let's do this.	Just kiss me.	Uh, yeah, I'm a doctor; all the symptoms are there you do.	I don't!
You know what it is? It's like a tickling. I got this, like this, like weird, like...it's a flutter. Erp!	Okay.	Whoa. Heh. Uh.... You know, I thought I had to sneeze, but it was a false alarm. Let's do this.	Just kiss me.
Yeah?	Nappy?	You know what it is? It's like a tickling. I got this, like this, like weird, like...it's a flutter. Erp!	Okay.
I guess you never know how the monster's gonna attack.	I want you to stop fooling around, and Give me a kiss.	Yeah?	Nappy?
Sometimes it pulls you away at the absolute worst time.	All right, we need to talk about this.	I guess you never know how the monster's gonna attack.	I want you to stop fooling around, and Give me a kiss.
Sometimes it even takes the roof over your head.And sometimes, the monster takes something you never thought you could lose.......Like your mojo.	Babe, I'm sorry.	Sometimes it pulls you away at the absolute worst time.	All right, we need to talk about this.
Actually, it's a roll of quarters. It's uh...laundry day! Heh.	Is that a roll of quarters in your pocket or are you just having a really good time?	Sometimes it even takes the roof over your head.And sometimes, the monster takes something you never thought you could lose.......Like your mojo.	Babe, I'm sorry.
See ya.	Oh.	Actually, it's a roll of quarters. It's uh...laundry day! Heh.	Is that a roll of quarters in your pocket or are you just having a really good time?
All right, calm down, he says that to everyone.	Hey, J.D.! How's your penis?	What, did someone send out a flier?!	Rise and shine, sport!
Okay, you're freaking out! Just keep your head down, and move.	Hey, Goldman! How's your penis?	All right, calm down, he says that to everyone.	Hey, J.D.! How's your penis?
No.	Hm? Oh, I get it! I haven't paid you back, so you won't even look at me?	Okay, you're freaking out! Just keep your head down, and move.	Hey, Goldman! How's your penis?
See what you did!	It's been one day, you greedy little bastard!	No.	Hm? Oh, I get it! I haven't paid you back, so you won't even look at me?
Luckily for me, I had a friend I could talk to about anything.	Dr. Reid, your truck is double-parked.	See what you did!	It's been one day, you greedy little bastard!
Heh, heh. Me neither, dawg!	Hell, no!	Hey, Turk. Do you ever have any trouble getting your manhood going?	Luckily for me, I had a friend I could talk to about anything.
Okay...?	Okay. I'm going to engage you two in a conversation. And you speak of it to no one, agreed?	It's like they're from another planet!	Tell me about it.
Don't sweat it. Well, have a good night.	Um...thanks again, J.D.	And sometimes that means letting a friend help you out.	Aww!
As for me, I just have to hope that my problem will eventually work itself out.	You too.	Don't sweat it. Well, have a good night.	Um...thanks again, J.D.
It was exactly what I wanted.	Merry Christmas.	As for me, I just have to hope that my problem will eventually work itself out.	You too.
I don't know...but she seems to _love_ it!The Congo. But look, Elliot, I think I think you're right last night was great, but w-we can't keep doing this.Dr. Reid.	Why does that one monkey keep biting the other one on the ass?	Animal Planet.	What'cha watching, buddy?
Mistake or not, one cool thing about sex is, it always seems to put you in a good mood.Hell, I think it even cheers up the people around you.	Dr. Dorian.	I don't know...but she seems to _love_ it!The Congo. But look, Elliot, I think I think you're right last night was great, but w-we can't keep doing this.Dr. Reid.	Why does that one monkey keep biting the other one on the ass?
What to do? What to do...what to do, what to do, what to do?	Me too.	Ugh! What a day! Whoo-ee! I am as stressed out and vulnerable as I was last night.	That's just great.
Oh, come on, we could we could rent a movie...got a fresh pack of Uno cards....You know what we could do? We could have sex again I'm throwing it out there.	I don't feel like doing anything.	What to do? What to do...what to do, what to do, what to do?	Me too.
Oh, come on! I'm sorry, I was kidding! I'm just it's just a joke!	Bite me.	Oh, come on, we could we could rent a movie...got a fresh pack of Uno cards....You know what we could do? We could have sex again I'm throwing it out there.	I don't feel like doing anything.
Stay calm.	No, I mean it like you did last night.... Come bite me.	Oh, come on! I'm sorry, I was kidding! I'm just it's just a joke!	Bite me.
Look, Elliot, we're adults. I don't think we have to apologize for enjoying what we're doing.	J.D., it's just sex.	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hello, and whoa!	So we can't keep doing this.
If you want....	I guess we could just be sex buddies.	And that's when she said the words every man is dying to hear.	Look, Elliot, we're adults. I don't think we have to apologize for enjoying what we're doing.
No, no, I'm I'm not kidding. I...can't.	Oh, right. Tell me.	Oh, I...can't tell you, it's, you know, doctor-patient confidentiality.	What's all that about?
Can't!	Can't...or won't?	No, no, I'm I'm not kidding. I...can't.	Oh, right. Tell me.
What are you talking about?	We're not okay.	Nah. Kelso calmed 'em down. I think we're okay.	Are they still going at it?
He's had a nasty case of pneumonia. Let's see. Well, his leukocytosis is resolved, and his blood cultures are negative.... Tell him we'll do the best we can.	You know, Mr. Woodbury's son is getting married this weekend; he keeps asking me if he's gonna be able to go.	Later, dude.	Woo! I feel _so_ much better! See ya, bud!
Where's the wiggle room in that? There's no wiggle!Fine. Let me just tell him with you so I can enjoy it, too.	Oh, come on! Can't we just tell him that he can go?	He's had a nasty case of pneumonia. Let's see. Well, his leukocytosis is resolved, and his blood cultures are negative.... Tell him we'll do the best we can.	You know, Mr. Woodbury's son is getting married this weekend; he keeps asking me if he's gonna be able to go.
Fo' shizzle.	What are you guys, just sex buddies or something?	Oh, relax, man. We're just having fun.	It's a gift. Now, you remember what happened the last time you two got together, right?
Look, if it ever got that emotional, I'd break it off.	Okay.I don't wanna get all Dr. Phil on you, but the last time I checked, women have a hard time separating sex from emotions. So, you may think you're just tappin' that right now, but pretty soon she's gonna be like, "J.D., I need you."	Fo' shizzle.	What are you guys, just sex buddies or something?
You are good!	Okay. Oh, by the way, dude right there is totally hitting that dude! He's totally hitting him!	Look, if it ever got that emotional, I'd break it off.	Okay.I don't wanna get all Dr. Phil on you, but the last time I checked, women have a hard time separating sex from emotions. So, you may think you're just tappin' that right now, but pretty soon she's gonna be like, "J.D., I need you."
I'm so glad Esteban found someone!	I know.	You are good!	Okay. Oh, by the way, dude right there is totally hitting that dude! He's totally hitting him!
I guess when you work in a world of uncertainty, it's great to have something at home you can count on.	Sweetheart, Mr. Woodbury is still requiring a lot of O2, I'm afraid we're gonna have to keep him here over the weekend. Do me a favor: Give him the skinny, will you.	Around here, things can turn bad in a heartbeat.	Uh, no you don't. She switched off, too.
Oh. Okay.	Sitting in the dark...crying. So, you know, the usual.	Elliot? What are you doing?	I guess when you work in a world of uncertainty, it's great to have something at home you can count on.
She needs you? Oh, my God, Turk was right. You have to stop kissing her, and put an end to this before she gets hurt!	J.D., I had such a crappy day. I really need you right now. Come here.	Oh. Okay.	Sitting in the dark...crying. So, you know, the usual.
Eh, she's a tough kid you can tell her later.	Is there something wrong?	She needs you? Oh, my God, Turk was right. You have to stop kissing her, and put an end to this before she gets hurt!	J.D., I had such a crappy day. I really need you right now. Come here.
Mmmmm.	God, this can't be happening! I'm a doctor! What the hell use is being a doctor if nobody lets you treat them? What is going on with my life?	No!	You didn't tell anyone that I'm Republican, did you?
Hello? ... Oh, hi, Mom! ... Yeah! I miss you, too! I haven't spoken to you in so long.Hi, Mr. Turk. ... No, Chris isn't here. ... No! No, sir, I didn't say "Mom," I said..."mon," like, "Hey, mon, we be jammin'!" ... N-no, sir, I don't think all black people are Jamaican.I I love you too, Mommy!Sir, could you call back later? Chris will be home.	This is not the time to talk it out. So you just need to get out of the situation without making her suspicious.	Mmmmm.	God, this can't be happening! I'm a doctor! What the hell use is being a doctor if nobody lets you treat them? What is going on with my life?
I know, I have to go throw up first.	His office is that way.	Wait, wait, you know what? Come on...Mr. Woodbury's doing well enough to be discharged. I don't mind standing up to Kelso on this one. Time to take the "G-R" off my gratitude and give that old bastard some attitude, J.D. style!	Here goes.
I'll go talk to him.That I.V. looks like it's infiltrating. Nurse must've screwed up.	Yeah, he said he was trying to protect me.	What?	I found out that Turk was telling my patients to switch off of my service.
Some realizations stop you in your tracks. Others can lead you in new directions.	Come on, man, where's the love? Where's the where's the loyalty? Where's the automatically siding with the person you care about the most?Oh, my God, that's what you're doing, isn't it. Isn't it?	No.	What's up? This is about Elliot? Don't you want to hear my side of the story with your little sex buddy?
Hopefully, you see yourself in time to make a change.	Mr. Woodbury! Hold on a sec!	It's a funny thing when we're forced to see ourselves in a new light.	You get your damn life in order.Oh, and, Barbie? Let's say word were to get out that Uncle Cox was doling out the feel goods? I'll make ya pay ya have no idea. Huge!
And hopefully you'll be respected for it.	Unfortunately, we're not comfortable discharging you just yet. I'm really, really sorry.	Hopefully, you see yourself in time to make a change.	Mr. Woodbury! Hold on a sec!
Me neither.	No, this. You know sex buddies.J.D., Dr. Cox and I were talking, and my life is just so scattered right now. And I just...I just can't seem to grab a toe-hold, you know? And...I know myself, and if we keep doing this, I'm not gonna be able to separate the sex from my feelings. And we'll just end up being a couple again. And...neither one of us wants that, right?I mean, I know I don't.	Okay, less tongue, less tongue.	I.... I can't do this.
Uh.... It's it's no big deal. You you get your stuff out of my room, and you crash on the couch.	So, what do we do?	Me neither.	No, this. You know sex buddies.J.D., Dr. Cox and I were talking, and my life is just so scattered right now. And I just...I just can't seem to grab a toe-hold, you know? And...I know myself, and if we keep doing this, I'm not gonna be able to separate the sex from my feelings. And we'll just end up being a couple again. And...neither one of us wants that, right?I mean, I know I don't.
Oh, hey, Dr. Kelso.	It's weird to run into someone from the hospital out in the real world.	Why does she go in there!? I mean, he's behind the doh'!	You wish you were allowed to yell at the screen, don't you!
Morning, pal.	Oh...right. Morning, buddy!	Ultimately, life is a lot simpler at home.Unless you live with a co-worker you're crazy about, and she recently decided she can't handle sleeping with you, and she just wants to be friends.	Oh, I'm sorr You named your car, huh?
All right, just relax. You can totally handle this.	I'll just go get dressed...and then, uh, we can go to work.	Morning, pal.	Oh...right. Morning, buddy!
You were right. I'll just...put this guy's side-view mirror on his roof.Argh.	Told you I could fit in this spot!	Chop Chop-chop, buddy!	All right, just relax. You can totally handle this.
Ooh!Yes?	Hey, J.D.	You were right. I'll just...put this guy's side-view mirror on his roof.Argh.	Told you I could fit in this spot!
G'head.	I wanted to say something, you know, before we go back in there.	Ooh!Yes?	Hey, J.D.
Why?	That I understand that it's gonna be a little bit harder for you to transition into being just friends again.	G'head.	I wanted to say something, you know, before we go back in there.
What does that have to do with anything?	Because...you're a guy?	Why?	That I understand that it's gonna be a little bit harder for you to transition into being just friends again.
I know.Oh, yeah...this is how you like it.	You're right. You know what we should do? Everything I own is in the back of this truck including my bed. We should just get in there, get naked, and have sex one last time just get it out of our system.J.D., I was kidding to prove a point.	What does that have to do with anything?	Because...you're a guy?
Oh, hey, Lisa.	Hey, J.D.	Nevermind.	Gimme it!You want this? You want this?Psych!
So, she wants to play Chicken, huh? Well, buckle up, missy!	No I don't. You can "ehn-ehn" with anyone that you want.	You guys, this conversation is starting to make me feel a little uncomfortable, okay? And I'm sure "Dr. Reid" feels the same way.	"Ohh! Dr. Reid!" Sweet!
Maybe I will!	You should.	Well, maybe I'll just ask Lisa out again.	So, she wants to play Chicken, huh? Well, buckle up, missy!
Good.	Cool.	Maybe I will!	You should.
That's what I'll do.	Take it home.	Good.	Cool.
So, anyway, Elliot....	What the hell? Did you just throw something out into the hall?	Hey, Todd.	Okay, you're smarter than him. Think of something clever to get him out of here.
Great! ...You know, but there's no rush for you to move out.	Hey, I found an apartment!	So, anyway, Elliot....	What the hell? Did you just throw something out into the hall?
That would be stupid.	Well, what are we gonna do, just live with each other forever, and anytime we feel, like, lonely or vulnerable, we just hop into bed and have hot sex?	Great! ...You know, but there's no rush for you to move out.	Hey, I found an apartment!
I know.	We're both human, so, staying in that situation would be a big mistake.	That would be stupid.	Well, what are we gonna do, just live with each other forever, and anytime we feel, like, lonely or vulnerable, we just hop into bed and have hot sex?
I I didn't mean it that way, I just....	What do you think, there aren't kids out there that want to grow up to make the world sparkle?	About...being a janitor?	Actually, I'm going to speak at my son's career day.
Look!	How did you mean it?	I I didn't mean it that way, I just....	What do you think, there aren't kids out there that want to grow up to make the world sparkle?
I never said that.	I was just thinkin' about what you said, and, uh, you're right buncha kids don't want to hear about being a janitor.	Ow.	Guess she told him.Gotta go.
Okay, maybe you're right. But, we're doctors, man. I mean, that comes with the territory; some patients just don't like telling the whole truth.	Well, if the cut was that deep, I'd probably just, uh, pull your arm off.Once again: _Doctor_..._Jan_ _Itor_. Dr. Jan Itor.	It is not.	Dude, that whole damn building is packed with liars!
I don't know.... Maybe it's 'cause they're proud...maybe it's 'cause they're scared....	Well, I don't get why people have to do that.	Okay, maybe you're right. But, we're doctors, man. I mean, that comes with the territory; some patients just don't like telling the whole truth.	Well, if the cut was that deep, I'd probably just, uh, pull your arm off.Once again: _Doctor_..._Jan_ _Itor_. Dr. Jan Itor.
Maybe it's because telling the truth would make them feel too vulnerable.	You know what, it was just stuff! I'm fine.	I don't know.... Maybe it's 'cause they're proud...maybe it's 'cause they're scared....	Well, I don't get why people have to do that.
Oh, my God!	I guess. Dude, you're gonna be late for Gift Shop Girl.	Maybe it's because telling the truth would make them feel too vulnerable.	You know what, it was just stuff! I'm fine.
Congratulations! So, when are you gonna ask her?	Positive.	Okay, ready?You sure?	I'm doin' it.
You might as well put it in her cham-lame glass.	Tonight I'm gonna make her a nice dinner, then I'm gonna put the ring in her champagne glass.	Congratulations! So, when are you gonna ask her?	Positive.
Okay, first you gotta get, like, fifty candles, right?	Okay, Mr. Know-It-All, what would you do?	You might as well put it in her cham-lame glass.	Tonight I'm gonna make her a nice dinner, then I'm gonna put the ring in her champagne glass.
You spread 'em all over the room with some rose petals....	Mm-hmm?	Okay, first you gotta get, like, fifty candles, right?	Okay, Mr. Know-It-All, what would you do?
Like a meadow in springtime.	That's right, because the roses are beautiful, and they make the room smell amazing.	You spread 'em all over the room with some rose petals....	Mm-hmm?
You are naughty!	If I finally get a damn heart, I'll let you eat ice cream off it!	Hey, homeslice, we talked about this you don't get into bed until I come here so I can see your bootay.	Elaine's been on top of the heart transplant list so long, she's in and out of this hospital almost as much as I am.
I honestly believe, in hospitals...there's like this...balance. You know? It's like, when one person dies, another person gets a chance to live. I like to call it The Circle of Life.	Ugh. You know, it always feels so weird to be sitting around hoping someone's family pulls them off life support.	You are naughty!	If I finally get a damn heart, I'll let you eat ice cream off it!
I like that baby lion cub. What's his name...?	Oh, my God! You must stop watching 'The Lion king'!	I honestly believe, in hospitals...there's like this...balance. You know? It's like, when one person dies, another person gets a chance to live. I like to call it The Circle of Life.	Ugh. You know, it always feels so weird to be sitting around hoping someone's family pulls them off life support.
Trick question! You like it, too!	..."Simba"...?	I like that baby lion cub. What's his name...?	Oh, my God! You must stop watching 'The Lion king'!
I'd say she's pregnant.	Oh, you girls! Excuse me, Elaine, I actually need his opinion on something.	Trick question! You like it, too!	..."Simba"...?
It's kinda flattering that you'd choose me.	Just a terrific catch, there, Newbie. Listen to her heart, will ya? I heard mitral stenosis and I need an extra set of ears, let's go.	I'd say she's pregnant.	Oh, you girls! Excuse me, Elaine, I actually need his opinion on something.
But, ultimately, you have to grit your teeth and just say it.	No reason.	Sometimes, the words don't come out at all.	I loved it, but, why spend all this money on this fancy dinner?
You see, as a doctor, you get used to the whole balance in the hospital thing. You know, when one person lives, another dies, and how it always seems to even out...	We don't deliver this baby, your wife could die.	But, ultimately, you have to grit your teeth and just say it.	No reason.
Well, you know that I would never mean for that to happen. You know that, right?	Yeah.That's my favorite t-shirt.And this...my favorite skin!	Oh, no.	Thanks for the pen.
Okay, this is a little cozy for me.	Yeah! I know that.	Well, you know that I would never mean for that to happen. You know that, right?	Yeah.That's my favorite t-shirt.And this...my favorite skin!
You know, you and I are a lot alike. We may seem like the kind of guy you can just, you know, throw in a head-lock and draw a mustache on...but, in crunch time, we always come through.It's time. Come on.	I wish I could ask my wife. She'd be better at handling this than me.	Trust me, I wouldn't want to have to make this decision.	I don't think you people are getting how difficult this is.
Ultimately, it all boils down to what your attitude is about it.	Morning.	Death is always hanging around this hospital.	Nice job, Newbie. That's a real nice job. What we gotta do now is cross our fingers.
I think it's like a game of dodge-ball.There's a lot of chaos and screaming, and...you know...eventually you get your glasses snapped in half by the big kid who already has underarm hair. But then you wake up in the hot nurse's office, and when she leans in to put that bandage on your nose, you get a sense that something could actually happen if you just took a chance and buried your face in her knockers.	I really hope it's like a big Broadway musical. Everyone's all dressed up and singing to the rafters, and you go out with a real flourish.	What do you think death is like?	I got an idea: Why don't we switch to a cheerier subject!
All right, man. I understand.Still nothing?!	I'm not leaving this spot until she calls.	Woo-hooooo! She's thinkin', she's thinkin', and we should go out drinkin'! chicka uh-huh chicka-chicka.... Wanna get a beer?	He needs you. Stay positive.
Good sign? Dude, I am so sure Carla's gonna say yes, if she doesn't I'll power-walk naked through these halls singing "Me and Bobby McGee"!	We just keep missing each other. I'm not sweating it.She asked me to pick her up from the airport! That's a good sign, right!	All right, man. I understand.Still nothing?!	I'm not leaving this spot until she calls.
Why would I take offense to that?	Ahhh, Janis Joplin! My God, she was an uggo! No offense, sport uh, don't think I have anything against ugly people.	Good sign? Dude, I am so sure Carla's gonna say yes, if she doesn't I'll power-walk naked through these halls singing "Me and Bobby McGee"!	We just keep missing each other. I'm not sweating it.She asked me to pick her up from the airport! That's a good sign, right!
Dr. Townshend is like the Anti-Kelso.	No reason. Anyway, I see you're on the nephrology service for Dr. Townshend this month!	Why would I take offense to that?	Ahhh, Janis Joplin! My God, she was an uggo! No offense, sport uh, don't think I have anything against ugly people.
The nurses love him...	Hey, Doc!	Dr. Townshend is like the Anti-Kelso.	No reason. Anyway, I see you're on the nephrology service for Dr. Townshend this month!
The attendings love him....	Betty! That color is great on you!	The nurses love him...	Hey, Doc!
And the weirdest thing of all is that he and Dr. Kelso are best friends.	Thank you. For being you.	Everyone.	"Baby, my heart's on fire...on fire...."
Todd, get dressed.	Keep it, man. That was for me!	Thanks, Todd. Here's that fifty bucks I promised you.	Not yet.
Turk's brother is staying with us for the weekend.	Yeah.	Oh, it changed since you saw it it got a haircut.	I'm not really proud of this, but I can pick your puff-'n'-stuff out of a line-up.
Oh, that depends.... What's a "happie-hap"?	Hey, Alfalfa! What's the happie-haps?	Hey, Kev'!	It'll be fun.
Oh, no, I don I don't mean like _that_ kind of slave.	Our own personal _what_, now?	That was good, Kevin! We should we should make him, like, make dinner for us tonight. He could be our own personal slave!	Yeah.
That that wouldn't be fun....	Well, how 'bout this: How 'bout he be the house slave, and I be the field slave. That sound like fun to you?	Oh, no, I don I don't mean like _that_ kind of slave.	Our own personal _what_, now?
'Scuse me.	Mmph.	Everybody! Soda chugging contest!	Oh, my God! Do something to change the subject! Anything!
But, sir, I don't	Nah, come on, let's do "old school."	Uh, sir, shouldn't I just do a modified Seldinger? I mean, it's so much safer.	A _cut down_? No one does those anymore.
So often in a hospital, you feel like you're alone on an island. Whether it's because you just can't bring yourself to make a really important decision...	Grab a scalpel; I'll get the kit.Somebody?	But, sir, I don't	Nah, come on, let's do "old school."
Or because you're waiting for an answer...	Carla looking at her ring.	So often in a hospital, you feel like you're alone on an island. Whether it's because you just can't bring yourself to make a really important decision...	Grab a scalpel; I'll get the kit.Somebody?
Or simply because you know a secret you wish you didn't.	Turk lost in thought.	Or because you're waiting for an answer...	Carla looking at her ring.
For me, I was stuck on that island because somebody else put me there.	Elliot nervously passing a hopeful Cox.	Or simply because you know a secret you wish you didn't.	Turk lost in thought.
Oh, no.	Okay, come on now, just cut through.... Good. Now, open up the vein.... But be careful not to nick the carotid artery.Oh, boy.	For me, I was stuck on that island because somebody else put me there.	Elliot nervously passing a hopeful Cox.
Dr. Kelso, I was the one who nicked the artery on Mr. Singer.	Sport, what did I tell you about my open-door policy? I don't have one.	Excuse me, sir, do you have a second?	Once a month, until she's dead!
Like putting someone else's feelings first for a change.Even if it goes against what you really want.	This is to my brother, y'all! My brother!	It's not always easy to do the right thing.	Goodnight, sir.
Of course, there's always ramifications....	I'm out.	Like putting someone else's feelings first for a change.Even if it goes against what you really want.	This is to my brother, y'all! My brother!
You think it's my fault he got fired, don't you.	Yeeeeeeee-ha!	My car....	Of course, there's always ramifications....
No reason.	Why would you say that?	You think it's my fault he got fired, don't you.	Yeeeeeeee-ha!
Why, because you're black?	Please, she's totally crushing on the brother.	Yoooooooo! Check out these fries! That girl is so in to me.	Thank you, Jenny.
Mmm?	I'm a vanilla girl.	Thank you, Jenny. Hey, wait, Jenny. Uh, what flavor do you usually go for: Do you like chocolate or _vanilla_?	Oh. Here's a towel.And here are your shakes.
Well, it'd only take fifteen minutes of your life, and it wouldn't hurt to be in good with him for once.	Really?	You should just do it.	Uh.
Yeah. Feel free to return the favor.	You're giving me advice?	Well, it'd only take fifteen minutes of your life, and it wouldn't hurt to be in good with him for once.	Really?
What's that supposed to mean?	Fair enough. Try this on for size: No matter where you go in life, always keep an eye out for Johnny, the tackling Alzheimer's patient.	Yeah. Feel free to return the favor.	You're giving me advice?
I got nothing.	I just got my vertebrae fused.	How's it going?	Buh-duh-na-duhhh...ooh!...ba-duh-duh-duhhh....da-bow!Had to be done, Bob. Continue, handsome.
I'm pressing the button.... It's not working.	Hey! Hold that elevator!	I got nothing.	I just got my vertebrae fused.
I've been doing some thinking, about how you're always blaming me for everything, and how you just send a constant stream of crap my way...and...I decided I need a break.	If it isn't my favorite career counselor. You wouldn't happen to have any more tips on how to climb _down_ the ladder, would ya?	"Two bits."	knock, knock-knock, knock, knock...
No. I...came over here to tell you that I traded with another resident and switched off your service for a while.	So, what'd you come by to tell me you're a complete wuss?	I've been doing some thinking, about how you're always blaming me for everything, and how you just send a constant stream of crap my way...and...I decided I need a break.	If it isn't my favorite career counselor. You wouldn't happen to have any more tips on how to climb _down_ the ladder, would ya?
Sure.	I'm starting to think that if she really loved me I'd know by now. Maybe it's time to retreat, protect myself, so I don't get hurt any worse. I really don't want to talk about it, though.	I don't think he'd do well in group. So, uh, what's up with Carla?	Come here!
Oh, my God, it's pancake man.	Oh, yeah?	Ahhh, eight strips of bacon! That girl is all _about_ the J.Dizzle.	You're welcome!
Hi, yeah, I'm stuck in the elevator?	Bat Cave.	"Everybody was kung-fu fighting!" "Those cats were fast as lighten "	Thank you. And Perry, if there's someone in your life at that hell-hole of a hospital who you actually listen to, you should do everything in your power to keep them around. Because that person is nothing short of a genius.
Because you did this!	Yeah.... I'm afraid it might be a little while.	Hi, yeah, I'm stuck in the elevator?	Bat Cave.
Hello?	Aw, now, I think we both know you did this to yourself. Well, I'll let you go.	Because you did this!	Yeah.... I'm afraid it might be a little while.
Oh, hey, Dr. Cox! Good to see you!	Mm-hmm. No, it's okay. We're gonna be able to work this thing out, seriously.Put your hands together like you're praying.	Look, I promise you the "door open" button was not working.	Well, sometimes in life you gotta do what you gotta do.
I guess, in the end, everything comes down to timing.Sometimes, you just have one moment to seize it.	Hey, I'll hang on to this!	The second that Dr. Cox patted me on the shoulder, I thought about how he always shows up in the nick of time.	Oh, just give him a pat on the back he's been wanting it since day one.Just do it!
How's that taste, Blondie!	Okay, I'll, uh, I'll go ahead and and make a little toast, here. Uh, a toast that only people that've known...Turk and Carla more than a week will understand. You guys rock. You do.	Sure, Paul was dating Elliot. But, luckily, I'm not the jealous type.	You're absolutely right!
Lame! This guy.	You guys, you know, I've just gotten to know you as a couple, but you remind me of my grandparents. They were married for sixty-five years, and every night before Grandpa and Grandma would walk around the block, he would look deep into her eyes as if to say, "I'd follow you anywhere." Anyway, the way you two just looked at each other, I could have sworn I was looking at them.	How's that taste, Blondie!	Okay, I'll, uh, I'll go ahead and and make a little toast, here. Uh, a toast that only people that've known...Turk and Carla more than a week will understand. You guys rock. You do.
You can't teach that.	See, now, what you want to do is choke up on the club like this? And then hit this bad boy like a baseball!	Yes, Doctor.	Well, Mr. Simms, it could be because it's damp out. It could also be because, four days ago, I sliced your chest open with a giant knife. You had surgery, buddy, you'll be fine.Hey, Dr. Dorian, I have a couple of minutes off. Would you like me to show you that technique I was telling you about?
So, what was up with Mr. Simms back there?	No you cannot, my friend. No you cannot!	You can't teach that.	See, now, what you want to do is choke up on the club like this? And then hit this bad boy like a baseball!
Are you gonna tell him?	Ahhh, during his open-lung biopsy, I accidentally nicked his intercostal artery, and now he's got a hematoma.	So, what was up with Mr. Simms back there?	No you cannot, my friend. No you cannot!
Yeah, but...don't you believe in bad karma?	What, and risk a lawsuit? Are you crazy? Besides, it'll heal just fine, anyway. Hey, throw me another ball.	Are you gonna tell him?	Ahhh, during his open-lung biopsy, I accidentally nicked his intercostal artery, and now he's got a hematoma.
Righty-o.	Karma, schmarma. Now listen, if you're not getting the length on the drive that you need, a lot of the better pros take a running start.	I dunno. Me, I think karma keeps the universe in order.	Hot cuppa lava, coming through.Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaggggggggggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!
Enjoy your special day.	Get the hell away from my stomach, or I'll put you in a leg-lock and snap your little bird-neck with my enormous thighs.	There she is! Are you ready to be born today! Jeebeedeebeejeebee....	Dammit!
Wait, wait, wait. Your your windshield's been broken for like a year!	Yeah.... Seems like one of the golf balls you hit went through the windshield of my van. No big deal, I just expect you to replace it, that's all.	You and your stupid Christmas present!	Hey, guys! Check out the personalized golf club cozy I found on the roof!"Hi, Davey!"
Ever?	Let's not tell anyone! Ever! Ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever! EVER!	Let's come clean.	We both knew what we had to do.
I guess it's hard to predict how a person will react.	Ever!	Ever?	Let's not tell anyone! Ever! Ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever! EVER!
Dr. Cox	Gimme a break I got a lot on my mind, Ellen! Ooh! Look at that! I bounced back! A-hey-anyway, the cave bat just kicked me out of its lair, and seeing as I no longer have my all-access pass to crazy town, I'm going to need you to occasionally go in there and poke her with a broomstick, just to see how she's doing.	What?	Hey, Girl's Name!
But what if she has the baby while I'm in there?	Uh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh! Please! Just...check on her, 'kay? All right.	Dr. Cox	Gimme a break I got a lot on my mind, Ellen! Ooh! Look at that! I bounced back!

AAAGGGHHH!! GAH! Oh, somebody get it off!!!!!!	Goo-goo, ga-ga! Ga-ga, goo-goo! Goo-goo! Gee-gee! Agh!	What the hell is that?	Here it comes!
Now do you see?	No!	Turk! The Dairy Queen burned down!	Apparently my face is scaring my patients, so you're going to take them off my hands for about a week.
Yep. So...? How ya doin'?	He asked you to...check in on me?	Look, Dr. Cox asked me to check in on you; I'm sorry I haven't been here until now.	Hm.
Well, you sound good.	Well, I have ruined everything! All he tried to do was take care of me and show me that he loved me. But, no, I had to drive him away because I don't like being vulnerable even when I'm normal, let alone with my ankles in stirrups and my coochie on display. So, now he's gone away for good; and I would really like to get this stupid thing out of me so I can go home and kill myself!	Yep. So...? How ya doin'?	He asked you to...check in on me?
What are you talking about?	I was going to tell him the truth eventually, I just wanted to see if he was going to be with me because he _wanted_ to, not because he _had_ to. Do you know what I mean?	Well, you sound good.	Well, I have ruined everything! All he tried to do was take care of me and show me that he loved me. But, no, I had to drive him away because I don't like being vulnerable even when I'm normal, let alone with my ankles in stirrups and my coochie on display. So, now he's gone away for good; and I would really like to get this stupid thing out of me so I can go home and kill myself!
...you can't hide from it.Karma's really just about doing the right thing.	Hi, Dr. Kelso!	Because I honestly believe, if you've got some bad karma coming your way, well...	Dude! It is so nice out here! You mind if I take it down to the banana hammock?
....Or about being who you really are.Either way, it's a lot to think about.	So, uh...anyway, Mr. Simms, I wanted to explain to you why your chest was hurting? During surgery, I....	...you can't hide from it.Karma's really just about doing the right thing.	Hi, Dr. Kelso!
...Yeah....	Oh, my God. Would you look at the mug on Jordan's baby? Must have one butt-ugly father!	....Or about being who you really are.Either way, it's a lot to think about.	So, uh...anyway, Mr. Simms, I wanted to explain to you why your chest was hurting? During surgery, I....
Dr. Cox, I have to tell you something....	Kudos for honesty, there, Newbie but, again, no talking.	"J.D. has a tiny pickle"?	Okay, fine. I'll just read the wall.
I may have.	Oh, my goodness, Newbie. Are you so uncomfortable with Jordan here that you've, in fact, stopped peeing mid-stream?	Ahoy.	Oh, that's lovely.Huh! Well, hello, sailor.
How the hell did we lose?! We have Chet!	And that's game!	Grrrrrr.	Turk likes to blow off steam by playing basketball before surgery. I always get my ass kicked.... But not today.
Chet, you suck!!!AAARRRGGGHHH!!!You know what, some stereotypes are true, Turk. Okay? And, just maybe, black people are a little better at basketball. Whatta you say?	Sorry, man.	How the hell did we lose?! We have Chet!	And that's game!
I haven't even started yet.	Well, now, Maggie! I can only assume that you are whiling away the morning cat-chatting with your favorite gal-pal because you've already finished your pre-rounding?	What?	Oh, with patients I say "dookie." Oh, dookie!
Gotcha! Finished!	What?	I haven't even started yet.	Well, now, Maggie! I can only assume that you are whiling away the morning cat-chatting with your favorite gal-pal because you've already finished your pre-rounding?
I could tell you some stories.	That's a good one, Newbie. My heart is racing. You are quite the prankster.	Gotcha! Finished!	What?
Well, is there anything I need to do for her lung nodule?	And if there's a God in heaven, you never will. This is Mrs. Gracin's chart her private practice doctor just showed up, so I am off this one.	I could tell you some stories.	That's a good one, Newbie. My heart is racing. You are quite the prankster.
Great. Another pretentious private practice guy who's gonna order me around while he counts his money all day.	Oh, I don't know. What do you say you start her on 20 CCs of It's not my problem anymore!	Well, is there anything I need to do for her lung nodule?	And if there's a God in heaven, you never will. This is Mrs. Gracin's chart her private practice doctor just showed up, so I am off this one.
Yeah, we yeah.	You know what I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you; I do want to hear the end of that story, though could you get a pulmonary consult for Sally for me?	You know, I'm always pulling pranks, too. Like, before, Dr. Cox was like, "Did you do that pre-rounding?"	How is that funny? Eh, just go with it.
Ha!	You're probably thinking, Why didn't you do that before I got here? But you weren't sure if you'd be over-stepping your boundaries. What if I was some sort of territorial ass with a giant ego or a territorial ego with a giant ass. Stop me, Sally, please!	Yeah, we yeah.	You know what I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you; I do want to hear the end of that story, though could you get a pulmonary consult for Sally for me?
Or...in Mr. Hilliard's case....	A golf cart being driven across a course by a man slumped over the steering wheel.	Or anger, from, say, three double-bogeys in a row.	A kid in a classroom, passed out on top of his test paper.
Oh, Jay! You're so crazy!	...Well, it's not uncommon! I think a lot of people keep, uh, plants in their apartment. Right, J.D.?	Sometimes, when you're in an awkward situation, the best thing to do is to go to your happy place.	Petey.
What's up his pooper?	We have a little history.... Yeah....	Oh, Jay! You're so crazy!	...Well, it's not uncommon! I think a lot of people keep, uh, plants in their apartment. Right, J.D.?
Yeah.	Actually, I think he's mad 'cause I went into private practice and he's stuck in this hell-hole.	What's up his pooper?	We have a little history.... Yeah....
That's lame.	You wouldn't believe this, but that guy was my mentor, man. I mean, I lived and breathed for that guy's approval.	Yeah.	Actually, I think he's mad 'cause I went into private practice and he's stuck in this hell-hole.
Tell me about it.	I know! Once you learn the tricks, though, he's easier to deal with; you'll see.	That's lame.	You wouldn't believe this, but that guy was my mentor, man. I mean, I lived and breathed for that guy's approval.
No, no, I'm serious tell me about it.	Yeah!	Tell me about it.	I know! Once you learn the tricks, though, he's easier to deal with; you'll see.
No, I do. Now, how do you get him to stop calling you girl's names.	Oh! Ohh. Uh, well, you know when he gets on his rants, he gets all hyped up, his vein starts sticking out of his neck, and he starts yelling at ya when he's done, just look at him, stare him right in the eye, and say, "I'm sorry, what were you saying?"I don't know why, but it works; trust me.	No, no, I'm serious tell me about it.	Yeah!
Oh. Nevermind.	Girl's names?	No, I do. Now, how do you get him to stop calling you girl's names.	Oh! Ohh. Uh, well, you know when he gets on his rants, he gets all hyped up, his vein starts sticking out of his neck, and he starts yelling at ya when he's done, just look at him, stare him right in the eye, and say, "I'm sorry, what were you saying?"I don't know why, but it works; trust me.
Okay, think of something believable. Grandma died! No, no, no, no, don't do that...because if she does die, you'll feel awful; and, let's face it, she's no spring chicken. I should call her. But then, whenever we talk, I have nothing to say how 'bout asking me how I am for once!	Oh, what plans!?	I have plans tonight.	I knew this was his way of reaching out, but still....
My grandma died!	Newbie!	Okay, think of something believable. Grandma died! No, no, no, no, don't do that...because if she does die, you'll feel awful; and, let's face it, she's no spring chicken. I should call her. But then, whenever we talk, I have nothing to say how 'bout asking me how I am for once!	Oh, what plans!?
Unfortunately, that never works.	Nancy! Nancy.	Everyone deals with problems in their own way.Some lash out at others......some just end up lashing out at themselves......and some people just try to hide.	Three-day weekend! Columbus day! That's coming up, right? Come on!
Laverne?	No, I'm _not_.	Ohhh, my God! You're actually jealous that I'm hanging out with another doctor!	He is a bad guy; and Newbie, if you're smart, you'll stay away from him.
Ta-DOW!	Jealous!	Laverne?	No, I'm _not_.
Don't worry about it, champ. It's all right to need me.	Look, Marcia, if I were you, I'd drop this jealousy thing right now.	Ta-DOW!	Jealous!
That was a good one.	What is wrong with you?	Do you not see the hate?	Very well, sir! Thank you for asking! How are you?
He's doing it!	I think so.All right, go.Hold it! Nah.	That was a good one.	What is wrong with you?
Cool! These guys are finally starting to get along!...Or not.	Look at Rockefeller! Pass me the remote, buddy!	Hey! Do you guys mind if I turn on CNN? My grandma bought me a stock I wanna see how it's doing.	No, how 'bout you never mention Jordan again.
Or...we could just...leave it on this station....	No big deal! I'll, uh, you know, do one of these change the channel.	Cool! These guys are finally starting to get along!...Or not.	Look at Rockefeller! Pass me the remote, buddy!
Ahh, he just wouldn't be Dr. Cox if he didn't refer to me as a 'her.'	And worse than that, you did it knowing full-well just exactly how I felt about her.	That seemed a little possessive...but I'm flattered!	You went ahead and took something that did not belong to you.
That's a lie! You bought me a latte!Hey, guys.	Hey, for what it's worth, I didn't make the first move.	Ahh, he just wouldn't be Dr. Cox if he didn't refer to me as a 'her.'	And worse than that, you did it knowing full-well just exactly how I felt about her.
That you're allowed to talk?	Still no talking in the bathroom, Newbie.You know what's weird?	Hey, Dr. Cox!	I guess sometimes it comes down to loyalty.
Who cares if Jordan wants to keep it a secret? Tell him it's his baby! Scream it from the mountains!	I never blamed Jordan. I was a chief resident, I was here all the time, and I always made damn-sure she knew she came second. But, God almighty, I'm trying harder this time. I just hope I'm doing the right thing, you know?	That you're allowed to talk?	Still no talking in the bathroom, Newbie.You know what's weird?
Around here, you have to grab hold of the littlest victories.Whether it's victories over your insecurities....	Oh!	Hey, Jordan. How' ya doin'?	Hi, handsome. How are you?Oh! Hello, D.J.
...or security's victories over you.	Doc-Doc-Dr. Kelso?	Around here, you have to grab hold of the littlest victories.Whether it's victories over your insecurities....	Oh!
Either way, you gotta choose your battles.	Dr. Kelso!	...or security's victories over you.	Doc-Doc-Dr. Kelso?
I'm so sorry.	No, no, no, I'm...I'm glad he heard it. I think it's important he sees how the world treats people like us.	I-I'm sorry. I di no, I didn't even see him there, I	Oh, my God, J.D.!
I guess I always hoped that, the longer you're a couple, the easier it got....	You want some kibble?	It's weird, ever since they got engaged, Turk and Carla have been arguing constantly.	To everybody!
Carla...a quick word?Is anybody else a doctor?	Uh, aren't you the guy that makes out with dogs?	Hello, ladies. Just window shopping, or would you like to try something on?	Honestly, it all makes me glad I'm on my own. I really don't think I'd have it any other
You know...he's he's the same. How are you doing?	How's he doing?	T.C.W. is a horrible story.She was married for three weeks before her husband got in a car accident and became a total vegetable. He's been on life support for the last two years; and since he was transferred to our hospital a month ago, she's visited every Wednesday. Very, very sad.Oh, yeah, and she's a babe! We call her "Tasty Coma Wife" or "T.C.W." for short.	Dude! T.C.W.'s back.
I think you're allowed to do whatever you want, Mrs. Moyer.	Actually, I was just calculating how much time I need to spend here so I don't feel guilty all week.... And now I need to double it, because I can't believe I just said that.	You know...he's he's the same. How are you doing?	How's he doing?
"Jamie"?	Please, call me Jamie.	I think you're allowed to do whatever you want, Mrs. Moyer.	Actually, I was just calculating how much time I need to spend here so I don't feel guilty all week.... And now I need to double it, because I can't believe I just said that.
Okay.	Mm-hmm.	"Jamie"?	Please, call me Jamie.
What is it?	You have something on your cheek.	Okay.	Mm-hmm.
Workin' in a hospital...it's always...something.	Here.	What is it?	You have something on your cheek.
Oh. Did you get it?	Yeah, I get it.	Workin' in a hospital...it's always...something.	Here.
Not that I need any help.	I'll go.I totally need to blow off some steam. Plus, the best way to meet skanky hos is to already have a girl with you.	Oh, come on, player, just a few beers! And if we accidentally run into some skanky hos, then so be it!	Sorry, buddy, can't swing it tonight.
Heh.	Pff! Hell no!	Not that I need any help.	I'll go.I totally need to blow off some steam. Plus, the best way to meet skanky hos is to already have a girl with you.
Oh?	You got something right....	Heh.	Pff! Hell no!
O...kay, I'm I'm sorry about the "nice day" thing. How can I make this right?	You always gotta have something to say, don't ya? Old nosy nelly, always gotta throw his two cents in.	Nice day, huh?	I'm still not sure how I feel about Paul and Elliot.Uh-oh....
Yeah.	What's it, uh, biscuit and gravy day?	O...kay, I'm I'm sorry about the "nice day" thing. How can I make this right?	You always gotta have something to say, don't ya? Old nosy nelly, always gotta throw his two cents in.
I thought you were ready.	Just give me one of them biscuits.	Yeah.	What's it, uh, biscuit and gravy day?
No, no, no.... Her ass was way too perfect.	Did you like her?	a little aggressive! Sorry.	Yeah?
I'm glad!	I can't believe I'm actually having fun!	No, no, no.... Her ass was way too perfect.	Did you like her?
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry; I've heard some idiots call you that.	So, "Tasty Coma Wife," huh?	I'm glad!	I can't believe I'm actually having fun!
I thought it up.	I kinda like it.	Oh, yeah, I'm sorry; I've heard some idiots call you that.	So, "Tasty Coma Wife," huh?
...or just desperately trying to get some attention.	Ahhhhhhhh!	Whether they're considering breaking up over a Slim Jim......or having their stomach pumped...	See ya, Elliot.
So, I'm not gonna sweat it just because I made a new friend, you know? I mean, what's the big deal?	Oh.	...or just desperately trying to get some attention.	Ahhhhhhhh!
Hey.	Hey!	So, I'm not gonna sweat it just because I made a new friend, you know? I mean, what's the big deal?	Oh.
Jack?	Jack wouldn't want my life to be over.	Holy crap!	It's time for me to start my life over. And I would love to take you out to dinner, if you would be interested.
Mr. Moyer!	My husband.	Jack?	Jack wouldn't want my life to be over.
I'd rather not.	Call him Jack.	Mr. Moyer!	My husband.
Of course.	I know it's weird. But give it some thought, okay?	I'd rather not.	Call him Jack.
Yeah.	All right, I'll see ya.	Hey.	Hey!
Yeah....	Dude! Was thatWas that Tasty Coma Wife?	Yeah.	All right, I'll see ya.
"Chink."	Five letters. "Showing vulnerability. 'A blank in one's armor'"...?	Good cover!	Cold chart. Brrrrr! Heh.
"Chink!"Oh, no, no. No, Franklyn, we were we were, um, we were doing a crossword puzzle, and....	What?	"Chink."	Five letters. "Showing vulnerability. 'A blank in one's armor'"...?

But I tell you one thing and you damn sure take it to the bank my mother never paid that much attention to me.
Ow.It's just been sorta hard for me lately, you know? I don't really have anyone special in my life, and...I'm pretty much either here or at home doing nothing, and....	Oh.

No, this is just a...pen. "Pink scrubs"....	Is that a straw in your pocket?	I don't know what I was thinking.	Elliot! We're talking about dried meat, here! Why would you get in the middle of this?
We should probably look into that.... You know, right after you blow chunks in the elevator.	Hell, yeah!	What? It's not my fault! Ralphie! Let's ride.Good work, buddy. Here's your twenty bucks. So you can really throw up whenever you want to?	Well, maybe what you should do instead is saddle up your mop and head upstairs someone has vomited in the second, third, and fifth floor hallways.
Thank you, Rowdy!	Mm! You went left! Very cool.	I could do that.	...Kiss me.
Uhh.... Honestly, I think you you might be moving a little fast for yourself. And there's a part of me that's very angry I just said that.	So, it's cold outside you wanna come back to my place?	Thank you, Rowdy!	Mm! You went left! Very cool.
I'll tell you what, if you look me in the eyes and you tell me that you're really ready to start something right now....we won't even need a cab I will, like, I will throw you over my shoulder and just sprint the twelve miles to your house!...But....	I'm so sick of being alone, you know?	Uhh.... Honestly, I think you you might be moving a little fast for yourself. And there's a part of me that's very angry I just said that.	So, it's cold outside you wanna come back to my place?
I hope you do.	I'll call you sometime.	I'll tell you what, if you look me in the eyes and you tell me that you're really ready to start something right now....we won't even need a cab I will, like, I will throw you over my shoulder and just sprint the twelve miles to your house!...But....	I'm so sick of being alone, you know?
I don't think people are meant to be by themselves.That's why, if you actually find someone you care about......it's important to let go of the little things....Even if you can't let go all the way.Because nothing sucks more than feeling all alone...no matter how many people are around.	Bye.	I hope you do.	I'll call you sometime.
Ohh, is that tomorrow?	Hey, J.D., are you starting your surgical elective tomorrow?	Well, that's a risk you take with that particular piece of fruit.You guys, come on! What do you say we dial down the whole power-nerd thing a little bit, okay?	But it squirts in my eyes.
Whatever. I don't really give a crap.Take a picture! Take a picture!! And you better smile this time.	Yeah!	Ohh, is that tomorrow?	Hey, J.D., are you starting your surgical elective tomorrow?

How amazing was that morning....	Dude. You okay? You're acting weirder than the time we saw Pat Benetar at StarBucks.	Entering the hospital as a surgeon has a whole different feel to it.	Janeane's built like a bear. She curled me once.

You wouldn't! That'd be crazy.	Why would I buy a saw if I didn't have stuff to cut?	Why _does_ an old hen need a banjo?	Why would an old hen need a banjo?
No thank you, I'm fine.	Exactly!Need some help with that?	You wouldn't! That'd be crazy.	Why would I buy a saw if I didn't have stuff to cut?

Ted!	You deserve Ted's Band today / So get up and get away....	What? Why?	Well, J-Dog, I don't know who you're slicing and dicing I assigned you to another surgeon.
You guys suck.	To	Ted!	You deserve Ted's Band today / So get up and get away....
Come on! Slappy-bag!	You've lost it.	Oh, yeah, we all went out last night, and I sorta made up some new nicknames for all the fellas. By the way, you're "Slappy-bag."	Dude, who the hell are you talking about?
Told ya you had nothing to saw.	Don't call me "Slappy-bag"!	Come on! Slappy-bag!	You've lost it.
Oww, man! Give it back!	Oh, really?	Told ya you had nothing to saw.	Don't call me "Slappy-bag"!

Smitty?	Mm-mm.	Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah? Not all surgeons are stupid, okay! Think-sack, here, went to Dartmouth!Oh, wait, you're Aardvark.	You were so desperate for the approval of all these stupid surgeons that you sold me down the river, huh?
Not all the time!	J.D., look at me. You are a dork.	Man! Ever since college, you always make everything seem so easy. No matter where you are, you always fit in. I dunno, I guess I thought with this surgery elective, it might be nice not to feel like a total dork for once.	No problem, lady.
Hey, I'm J.D.! I'm so stoked to be your roommate! Right on!	Every second, since the moment I met you.	Not all the time!	J.D., look at me. You are a dork.
What are you talking about? I thought you said hoops were cool? Hey, baby! Cham-pahg-nee?Med school chicks love ventriloquists!	To go along with his cap and gown, J.D. has gotten his ear pierced with a huge gold ring.	Hey, I'm J.D.! I'm so stoked to be your roommate! Right on!	Every second, since the moment I met you.
Apple-tini, please. Easy on the -tini.	A few minutes ago.	Tannest intern, baby! And it comes in a bottle!	J.D. is orange.
And that's why you hung out with me?	See, J.D., the thing that I always liked about you was that you were just yourself you never cared about what people thought.	Apple-tini, please. Easy on the -tini.	A few minutes ago.
Come on, player! You know I'm way more stud than dud!Wow, you can really taste the apples!	No, you had a car. Still do.	And that's why you hung out with me?	See, J.D., the thing that I always liked about you was that you were just yourself you never cared about what people thought.
And other times, just makes you miss what you had....a little.As for me, I'm happy just knowing who I am.	By golly, you're so pretty, I may not even use you!	But sometimes change doesn't last for long.	Well, what'd he do with the new one?
No problem, Dougster.	Hey, J.D.? Do you have any nasal spray?	And other times, just makes you miss what you had....a little.As for me, I'm happy just knowing who I am.	By golly, you're so pretty, I may not even use you!
For I am John Dorian King of the Nerds!	Yeah!	No problem, Dougster.	Hey, J.D.? Do you have any nasal spray?
It's not my place to tell!	Whatta you say, there, Stephanie; how about _you_ step up to the plate and tell the guy. My God! I'm only three weeks old, and already I've got more stones than you do and one of mine hasn't even dropped yet.	I think Dr. Cox would be more willing to help if he knew it was his baby.	So not Gustav! Busy doctor!
...or trying to live out your deepest fantasies.	Should I take a dookie before or after I lift weights? Mmmm....after!	Luckily, no one else'll bust my chops about the funeral. Because around here, you tend to get wrapped up in your own world.Whether you're trying to plan your day...	Well...I'm gonna get going.
...Maybe you're trying to break in the soles of your new Italian shoes...	Dammit! Don't you die on me! Clear! Kgh-bgghhhh!	...or trying to live out your deepest fantasies.	Should I take a dookie before or after I lift weights? Mmmm....after!
...or break down the spirit of your old whipping boy.	Sir, those shoes look a little small for you.	...Maybe you're trying to break in the soles of your new Italian shoes...	Dammit! Don't you die on me! Clear! Kgh-bgghhhh!
Isn't he fixing the heat down in Pediatrics?	I gotta fix my own damn copy machine 'cause the maintenance man claims he's got more important things to do!	One way or another, everyone finds a way to make it all about themselves.	Not lately. But when I do, it's reflection perfection!
As for me, no matter what Dr. Cox thinks, I wasn't going to that funeral to hit on Jamie.......I was going to pay my respects.	Whatever!	Isn't he fixing the heat down in Pediatrics?	I gotta fix my own damn copy machine 'cause the maintenance man claims he's got more important things to do!
Well, you look fantastic! And, you know, I don't mean "Hey, dude, check out that hot bitty at the bar!" 'fantastic' I'm talking about "I'm sorry for your loss" 'fantastic'.	J.D.! I'm so happy you came!	As for me, no matter what Dr. Cox thinks, I wasn't going to that funeral to hit on Jamie.......I was going to pay my respects.	Whatever!
Yeah, let's get the hell out of here.	Do you wanna grab a drink?	Well, you look fantastic! And, you know, I don't mean "Hey, dude, check out that hot bitty at the bar!" 'fantastic' I'm talking about "I'm sorry for your loss" 'fantastic'.	J.D.! I'm so happy you came!
Oh, yeah, I know! So so was I.	Oh, I was actually talking about him.	Yeah, let's get the hell out of here.	Do you wanna grab a drink?
Somebody's a smoker!	Oh, no! You have to order he's bussing those.	Oh, yeah, I know! So so was I.	Oh, I was actually talking about him.
I'll see ya.	Well...goodbye....	Nice job!	I had a blast.
Oh! Oh! Heh. I'm sorry, everyone. I...I dropped something on my toe. "Ahhhhhh!...AHHAAAAHHHH!" ...You know.... Carry on.	Whoops!	I'll see ya.	Well...goodbye....
You're sad.	I'm happy!	You've never been more confused.	I am okay, J.D. I'm really seeing things clearly.
You're at war!	I'm at peace.	You're sad.	I'm happy!
Last night, when you were showering.	When did you see my penis?	Look, uh..........JanitorI'm gonna be straight with you: I saw your penis, and I noticed a possible melanoma that you should really have checked out.	'Cause I'm not peeing! This is where I come to take my breaks. If I stand around out there, everyone tells me to do stuff.
Oh, I was outside, in the bushes.	Where were you?	Last night, when you were showering.	When did you see my penis?
Look, it was just a coincidence, man I mean, i-i-if you had looked out the window, you'd have seen my penis, you know!	Uhhh....	Oh, I was outside, in the bushes.	Where were you?
Because I had it out while I was looking at yours!	What!?! Why?	Look, it was just a coincidence, man I mean, i-i-if you had looked out the window, you'd have seen my penis, you know!	Uhhh....
Hermann the German! You must get that all the time!	Hey, you must be Dr. Dorian. I am, uh, Rolf's brother, Hermann.	Okay, regroup.	Because I had it out while I was looking at yours!
Oh.	No, first time....	Hermann the German! You must get that all the time!	Hey, you must be Dr. Dorian. I am, uh, Rolf's brother, Hermann.
Uh, well, uh, I could really use your help translating.	Let's hope it catches on!	Oh.	No, first time....
Uh, I got the, uh, results back from your biopsy...	Oh, sure.	Uh, well, uh, I could really use your help translating.	Let's hope it catches on!
...the lesions in your liver...	Wir werden dich zu einem...	Uh, I got the, uh, results back from your biopsy...	Oh, sure.
...are... consistent with metastatic pancreatic cancer.	Es sieht so aus, als ob du...	...the lesions in your liver...	Wir werden dich zu einem...
If you're not honest, you'll end up getting busted.	This is so weird I could swear that while I was in surgery, I heard you describing these sexy dreams about someone named Elliot!	If you're not open with someone, it's gonna catch up with you.	Hey!
You speak German?	Hey! I just met your patient, Mr. Mueller; we had such a nice chat.	Eh, but what do I know about good relationships? Two days ago, I had funeral sex.	No. Can I see that?
Germans!	Yeah! I can do a sweet little milkmaid: Guten Morgen, möchten Sie die Kühe melken?I can do an evil old hausfrau : ESS DEIN SCHNITZEL, SONST KRIEGST DU KEIN NACHTISCH! J.D.: German's such a beautiful language.... Anyhoo, I think Mr. Mueller's so amazing. I mean, yesterday, I pretty much told him he was gonna die; and his brother turned to him and he said, "Es wird alles wieder gut." And Mr. Mueller just accepted it!Well, why wouldn't he? "Es wird alles wieder gut" means "You're going to be fine."	You speak German?	Hey! I just met your patient, Mr. Mueller; we had such a nice chat.
His Biliary obstruction's relieved, and he's taking P.O.	We got Mr. Mueller's ultrasound back.	Fine, just tell him that lying to his brother isn't gonna make him any better!	He said,He didn't want to upset his brother, jackass!
Da!	That's good, yes?	His Biliary obstruction's relieved, and he's taking P.O.	We got Mr. Mueller's ultrasound back.
I'm a doctor. I had to tell you what was going on.	...But, I know this was uncomfortable, and, uh, I appreciate your concern.	Not that I totally expected that.	I don't like you.
I treated a patient today who was mad at his brother for presuming to know what's best for him. And that got me thinking. Because I was freaking out that we hooked up in the closet at the funeral, I did the same thing to you! So...if you're really ready, let's go for it! 'Cause, I'm crazy about you, and you're right your husband's gone, and he's never coming back!	J.D.? Wha ?	Excuse me, Jamie?	It's funny how one person can lead you to another. I mean, I knew Mr. Mueller's brother shouldn't have tried to protect him, and yet I was doing the same thing to someone else.
Who are these lovely people?	Uhh.	I treated a patient today who was mad at his brother for presuming to know what's best for him. And that got me thinking. Because I was freaking out that we hooked up in the closet at the funeral, I did the same thing to you! So...if you're really ready, let's go for it! 'Cause, I'm crazy about you, and you're right your husband's gone, and he's never coming back!	J.D.? Wha ?
Oh, God. How can I make this right?If only....	These are my late husband's parents.	Who are these lovely people?	Uhh.
Sweetie, it is!Now, exactly how much feeling am I supposed to lose in my extremities?	J.D., I really wanted tonight to be romantic.	What?	You know what? Forget I asked.
Still, things are going pretty well with me and Jamie.	Just enough so it still hurts.	Sweetie, it is!Now, exactly how much feeling am I supposed to lose in my extremities?	J.D., I really wanted tonight to be romantic.
Oh, no, this a a rash from my new watch. They didn't tell me the band was made out of....cat.	Looks like rope-burn to me.	Still, things are going pretty well with me and Jamie.	Just enough so it still hurts.
I didn't say "lowly."	Yeah. What, I don't get to wear shorts, 'cause I'm just a lowly janitor?	Shorts, huh?	What? I think Vera Wang makes very beautiful gowns. Plus, her last name is a very funny word for "penis." Who's with me? Air-five! Stsh! Stsh! Stsh!
Yes! Have you been drinking?	Oh, so now I'm a janitor?	I didn't say "lowly."	Yeah. What, I don't get to wear shorts, 'cause I'm just a lowly janitor?
I love your shorts, okay? I wish I had a pair just like 'em.	I'm not _drunk_.	Yes! Have you been drinking?	Oh, so now I'm a janitor?
Is that a gay joke?	Oh, gosh, Shannon, thank you _so much_ for clarifying my point by repeating it word for word. And now, in a reciprocal gesture, can I be included in the planning of your coming out party?	It's on you, pardner!	Okay, Mr. Westfeld, now the angioplasty went well, but here's the thing: It is on you, pardner. You gotta start watching what you eat so that we can kick this thing in the ass. Okay?
Man, once Dr. Cox gets on a roll, there's nothing that can derail him.	No, it's a cotillion joke. My God, Newbie, it's been two furiously frustrating years how is it possible that you still don't get me? I would never compare you to the gays! I like the gays I like their music, I like their sense of style, I especially like what they've done with Halloween but _our thing_ is that you are a _little girl_. That's who you are! But that's really not fair....	Is that a gay joke?	Oh, gosh, Shannon, thank you _so much_ for clarifying my point by repeating it word for word. And now, in a reciprocal gesture, can I be included in the planning of your coming out party?
Uh, ew.	Scoot.Can you hand my mouth guard to me?	A lot can change in a week.	Oh, I'm ready.
Mm!What are you two talking 'bout?	Come on, ladies! It's right hand, left hand, shoulder-pop, jump! Right hand, left hand, shoulder-pop, jump!	Whenever I see two beautiful women that I've been intimate with talking to each other, I always have the same fantasy....	Wow.... The past and the present.
I tell her way too much.	_Not_ the Rerun Dance.	Mm!What are you two talking 'bout?	Come on, ladies! It's right hand, left hand, shoulder-pop, jump! Right hand, left hand, shoulder-pop, jump!
Oh, thanks!	You left some stuff in my apartment.	I tell her way too much.	_Not_ the Rerun Dance.
Mmm....	See ya.	Oh, thanks!	You left some stuff in my apartment.
We're doing fine!	You wanna know why things with Jamie are so 'lamey'?	Mmm....	See ya.
Wrong! She just came by because she knows today at work, I need my......squash goggles.	Oh, please! She's clearing you out of her apartment!	We're doing fine!	You wanna know why things with Jamie are so 'lamey'?
I have to saw something later.	Mm.	Wrong! She just came by because she knows today at work, I need my......squash goggles.	Oh, please! She's clearing you out of her apartment!
Well, Jamie is not like you, okay!?	She's a drama queen, J.D.! When her husband was in a coma, it was all, like, taboo and exciting; but now that it's okay for the two of you to be together, the relationship's got no snap...it's got no crackle. J.D.... It's got no pop. I know! Because I'm a drama queen, too!	I have to saw something later.	Mm.
Ditditditdit!	No Pop!	Well, Jamie is not like you, okay!?	She's a drama queen, J.D.! When her husband was in a coma, it was all, like, taboo and exciting; but now that it's okay for the two of you to be together, the relationship's got no snap...it's got no crackle. J.D.... It's got no pop. I know! Because I'm a drama queen, too!
Yeah, I know. I was gonna wear 'em, but you know someone went and stole them out of my locker!	Anyway, what's the deal? We're supposed to be shorts buddies today. You saw the schedule: Monday-Tuesday, shorts; Wednesday, we wash 'em; Thursday-Friday, shorts; weekend, optional I'll be wearing shorts.	I think I would.	I wanted to see if you would whisper because I whispered.
Yes!	What?	Yeah, I know. I was gonna wear 'em, but you know someone went and stole them out of my locker!	Anyway, what's the deal? We're supposed to be shorts buddies today. You saw the schedule: Monday-Tuesday, shorts; Wednesday, we wash 'em; Thursday-Friday, shorts; weekend, optional I'll be wearing shorts.
As a doctor, you get good at thinking on your feet. I was able to protect the Janitor's feelings, plus, he totally bought it!	Let me see!	Yes!	What?
Oh, my God! She does want drama!	Don't lie to me! I asked you to go, so you punched in my coffee table, didn't you.	I'm so sorry! It was a total accident, I just...I just	Look, she probably does have to get up early, so just be cool.
This is totally normal. I mean, in relationships, you have to roll with the punches! Even the ones you don't see coming....	Come here. I'll take care of you.	Sometimes you make me so crazy!	Oh, my God! She does want drama!
Nice!	The drunkest one.	Really? Which one?	She's not pregnant!Man, I was getting really psyched for this whole wedding, man the dancing, the band, you woulda hooked up with one of Carla's sisters!
Because I don't want salad, that's why!Look, Jamie and I are gonna be together, and I don't care what you think, Dad!	On a date with Jamie, J.D. talks forcefully to the waiter.	Look, Jamie and I are gonna be together, and I don't care what you think, Mom!	As for my relationship, I was doing anything I could to keep the drama alive.
I'm warning you! Stop eyeballing my woman!	Jamie is cuddled up to J.D. as he forcefully addresses a midget.	Because I don't want salad, that's why!Look, Jamie and I are gonna be together, and I don't care what you think, Dad!	On a date with Jamie, J.D. talks forcefully to the waiter.
No, it was definitely that guy!	Actually, J.D., I think it was that guy!	I'm warning you! Stop eyeballing my woman!	Jamie is cuddled up to J.D. as he forcefully addresses a midget.
I don't know. How are you? Zinnnnng!	So, how's the drama queen doing?	Unfortunately, I was running out of ideas.	No, it was definitely that guy!
Because you're not right!	Why can't you just admit that I'm right?	I don't know. How are you? Zinnnnng!	So, how's the drama queen doing?
Fine, I'd stoop!	Well, we used to be a couple, and now that you're in the picture? Guess who wants me back!	I wouldn't stoop this low for drama.	What the hell was that all about?
Yeah.	I think you just have to gamble that once all the drama's gone, there's still gonna be something there. If not, it's her loss.	Asking you not to show up at my apartment drunk, naked, and crying. You know what's weird? I really like this girl, but I'm not sure I can keep it going with all the drama.	Uh-huh. And what does Jamie think you're doing over here?
Thanks.	Still, if it helps:	Yeah.	I think you just have to gamble that once all the drama's gone, there's still gonna be something there. If not, it's her loss.
Look, I'm sorry, okay? For...so many things. But, I'm a doctor I can't really wear shorts to work.	What's the big deal? Well, the Good Lord didn't bless my wife with all ten fingers. She's only got pointer...and...thumb-pinkie.	She just cut off a pair of scrubs and hemmed the bottom. What's the big deal?	My poor wife _slaved_ over these!
Nope.	Can't wear shorts to work?	Look, I'm sorry, okay? For...so many things. But, I'm a doctor I can't really wear shorts to work.	What's the big deal? Well, the Good Lord didn't bless my wife with all ten fingers. She's only got pointer...and...thumb-pinkie.
Not allowed!	Can't wear shorts to _work_?	Nope.	Can't wear shorts to work?
Oh, nothing. I'm just trying to mend some fences.	Thanks. What's up with the man-____?	Not allowed!	Can't wear shorts to _work_?
Oh, without a doubt.... But not about me. No, I...I kinda made all that stuff up. It just seems like you and I only really click when something crazy is going on.	So, do you think Elliot's somewhere right now, crying her eyes out?	Oh, nothing. I'm just trying to mend some fences.	Thanks. What's up with the man-____?
I dunno, I guess I realized I don't really want to be in a relationship like that.	Mm.	Oh, without a doubt.... But not about me. No, I...I kinda made all that stuff up. It just seems like you and I only really click when something crazy is going on.	So, do you think Elliot's somewhere right now, crying her eyes out?
No, Jamie, no! It's not an ultimatum, it's just something to think about.Oh, shoot, I gotta go!	Is that an ultimatum?	I dunno, I guess I realized I don't really want to be in a relationship like that.	Mm.
Paperwork...Mind-numbing monotony...And, of course, paperwork.As for the patients...	Give Miss Allan Acetaminophen for her headache, Restoril so she'll sleep, and Colace so she'll poop.	As for us, it's the end of our second year, and somehow each day had begun to feel the same.You see, after a while, your residency boils down to just a few things...Paperwork...The three prescriptions every patient gets...	I love you.
I guess that's why I'm so psyched our college buddy, Spence, is coming to town.	Oh, good. 'Cause I have an audition for "Stomp!" tomorrow. Look, just cut the damn thing off, will ya?	Uh, look, Mr. Graff, because it's diabetes-related, the pain in your foot isn't responding to pain-killers. But, I'd like to try an anti-seizure medication before we even consider amputation.	Paperwork...Mind-numbing monotony...And, of course, paperwork.As for the patients...
YES! On a pile of coats with hundreds of people around! What a whore!	Leslie Stevens!	You know, guys, I don't think it's really appropriate for us to be rehashing our college sexual conquests with Carla in the other room	Yes.
Carla...college wasn't all sex and coats. Spence, here, got me through a lot of hard times.	Who else! Who else did you bang??	YES! On a pile of coats with hundreds of people around! What a whore!	Leslie Stevens!
Yes!My life changed that day.	Why don't you just mousse the crap out of it straight up!	Carla...college wasn't all sex and coats. Spence, here, got me through a lot of hard times.	Who else! Who else did you bang??
What I've got you on is D5 half normal saline with 20 KCL at a hundred CCs an hour.	Check it out free pitcher.	That's good good sauce.	Aw.
Yeah. You know what? Maybe it would just be easier if I told you whose butt I _haven't_ had my fingers in?	That guy?	Yeah.	How about that guy?
Dream job....	Now that's one of the perks you never hear about. So, you guys pretty much landed your dream jobs, huh?	Yeah. You know what? Maybe it would just be easier if I told you whose butt I _haven't_ had my fingers in?	That guy?
Mm-mm-mm.	Hey, man? How am I supposed to finish this memo?	Dream job....	Now that's one of the perks you never hear about. So, you guys pretty much landed your dream jobs, huh?
Yes!	All right. Shall we get started?	Every year at this time, Kelso picks a resident to ride mercilessly until they crumble. The key is to jump on any easy question and impress him early.	This is not a good day to be late.
"Should we get started?" Answer: yes.	Excuse me?	Yes!	All right. Shall we get started?
E-eschemia.	What are the four differential diagnoses of the persistent ST elevation on any EKG? Dorian!	This is it. Last man standing.	Dr., uh, uh...Young Asian Fellow, bed seven needs a central line.And Dr. Murphy and Dr. Eager Beaver, step forward.
That's my social security number!	Right. 'Cause there's no way I could access the personnel files. Just impossible!By the way, uh: 987-65-4320	You couldn't have seen my paycheck.	I saw your paycheck, and I've been dying to tell you I make more than you do. Quite a bit more.
No, my PIN number is 3674.	No...that's your PIN number.	That's my social security number!	Right. 'Cause there's no way I could access the personnel files. Just impossible!By the way, uh: 987-65-4320
Do you have any idea what it feels like to have a janitor make more money than you?	Bingo!	No, my PIN number is 3674.	No...that's your PIN number.
Uh, we...we, uh, we had a few.	Hey, Betty. Hey, Wilma. Oh, what the hell, you're only forty minutes late. Do I...do I smell beer?	Of course, sometimes it's just having to work in wet grundies.	Gaaagh!
Look, Dr. Cox....	Newsflash: you can't drink and then come to work you're not airline pilots!	Uh, we...we, uh, we had a few.	Hey, Betty. Hey, Wilma. Oh, what the hell, you're only forty minutes late. Do I...do I smell beer?
...The reason we're doctors is because we have an innate desire to help people.	Aaaaah.	As I bent down to eat that peppered floor turkey, unaware that the cleanser the Janitor uses is an extremely potent diuretic, I realized something.	Would you eat off the floor?
And you have to have that desire, because at the end of your second year it's impossible to see the light at the end of the tunnel.So it becomes about perseverance......and fortitude......and sacrifice.	That was disgusting.	...The reason we're doctors is because we have an innate desire to help people.	Aaaaah.
Really, all you can hope for is just an occasional thank-you.	Later, dude.	Later.	I'm gonna miss you guys.... I'll see you later.
You're welcome.	So I'm supposed to be happy because someone finally did something right?	I'm so glad the medication worked on your foot.	Really, all you can hope for is just an occasional thank-you.
Ohhh! How cool was that!	Nice call on the anti-seizure medication, there, Newbie. You know I'm actually starting to think you may not be the worst resident that ever lived.	You're welcome.	So I'm supposed to be happy because someone finally did something right?
You shut up. You're an angry man!I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the whole "it's your baby" thing.We'll probably talk about that later.	Shut up.	Ohhh! How cool was that!	Nice call on the anti-seizure medication, there, Newbie. You know I'm actually starting to think you may not be the worst resident that ever lived.
No?	You know I'm I wasn't even mad at Jordan.	You shut up. You're an angry man!I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the whole "it's your baby" thing.We'll probably talk about that later.	Shut up.
You? Come on! You're gonna be a very scary fath I mean a great...you're gonna be a great father. Like last night, when you totally kicked our asses 'cause we deserved it? And do you remember that time you told me I wasn't the worst resident that ever lived?	No, I was scared. In fact, I was freaking out all day, because I'm quite confident that I'm gonna be an absolutely horrible father.	No?	You know I'm I wasn't even mad at Jordan.
You have no idea how much that meant to me.	You mean like eight seconds ago?	You? Come on! You're gonna be a very scary fath I mean a great...you're gonna be a great father. Like last night, when you totally kicked our asses 'cause we deserved it? And do you remember that time you told me I wasn't the worst resident that ever lived?	No, I was scared. In fact, I was freaking out all day, because I'm quite confident that I'm gonna be an absolutely horrible father.
But, Dr. Cox, you're always there when we need you! I think you have this fathering thing down!	I said I _think_ you may not be the worst resident ever, but I can't be sure of stuff like that. Come on, I haven't done the appropriate leg work!	You have no idea how much that meant to me.	You mean like eight seconds ago?
As a third-year resident, you know everyone so well you can practically speak for them. For instance....	Fine. Then I'll just put on something that rocks!	Morning, Steven.	Not allowed unless you're gay.
Remember: No more dancing.Pow!Good morning, Bambi. Sign this, please?Who you eyeballing, tough guy?	As a third-year resident, you know everyone so well you can practically speak for them. For instance....	Fine. Then I'll just put on something that rocks!	Morning, Steven.

Well, Zsa Zsa. Now you've put me in quite the pickle. You see, with those earphones on, you can't hear me; but! the odds are highly against you cracking open that yapper and annoying me today. So, what to do? What to do? What to do? Ahh, hell	And of course....	Remember: No more dancing.Pow!Good morning, Bambi. Sign this, please?Who you eyeballing, tough guy?	As a third-year resident, you know everyone so well you can practically speak for them. For instance....
See, things never really change around here....Surgical and Medical still play each other in basketball.	Stop addressing me as "Dr. Cox" in front of your patients. When they find out my actual name, they tend to page me with questions when they realize just exactly how inept you really are. Oh, and as an added safety measure, from now on, I'll only be responding to "Doc," "Doctor," "Ceasar," or "The Big Cheese;" and noooo, I'm _not_ joking. Not _now_ not ever.	Well, Zsa Zsa. Now you've put me in quite the pickle. You see, with those earphones on, you can't hear me; but! the odds are highly against you cracking open that yapper and annoying me today. So, what to do? What to do? What to do? Ahh, hell	And of course....
Yeah? Well I heard that your sister started drinking again!	I'm gonna toast you so bad, your momma ain't even gonna recognize you!

So, it's not supposed to be true?	I'm still not great at smack-talk.	Yeah? Well I heard that your sister started drinking again!	I'm gonna toast you so bad, your momma ain't even gonna recognize you!
And Elliot was still searching for something to turn things around for her.	No. Ohhh, let it pour, big guy.	So, it's not supposed to be true?	I'm still not great at smack-talk.
Uhhh, Code 3? Not as bad as a Code 4, but a hell of a lot worse than a Code 2.	What's that?	Uh-oh. Got a Code 3 down the hall.	Oh, good Lord, I have no idea. Okay, don't panic, just do what all doctors do in this situation and fake a page.
If you're wondering why Dr. Kelso's nose is squeaking......about a week ago, he was torturing Elliot......and Dr. Cox, well....Needless to say, there were consequences.	Yes?	Dr. Cox! Dr. Cox.Big Cheese.	Oh, yeah.
In a hospital, you can never try to get anything done Friday after 5 P.M. Because anyone who can actually help you is out of here like a gunshot.	Good luck, Bambi. Look at the time.	Mrs. Farr. You know what? The only way I'm gonna figure out what's wrong with this woman is start running tests for everything.	Got it.
Ow.	Watch out.	Whoooa! Agh!	There he is.
Look, Dr. Moyer	I'm head of the radiology department. You call me in from home to do an abdominal CAT-scan that could wait until Monday morning? Well, guess what? It's not happening.	Unfortunately, that's when we ran into a brick wall.	Ow.
Dammit, why can't we figure out what's wrong with this lady?	It feels good to work as a team and gather all the pieces of the puzzle together so we can finally look Mrs. Farr in the face and tell her...we still don't know what the hell she has.	Wow.	Hell, zhyeah!
I'm actually grateful most things don't change.	Atta boy.	Familial Mediterranean fever.	Aw, come on, you guys, gimme a break you know this.
And if something does change, more often than not it just reminds you of feelings you've had all along.	Now, I would've never figured it out unless you guys had done the leg work. You four deserve all the credit, really.Mrs. Farr, Dr. Cox has saved the day! Don't ya just love it? Come here!	Not only is the status quo good for work, it's also somewhat comforting.	My paddle's stuck in me!
Like I said, once you hit the third year, there aren't a lot of surprises.	You look beautiful.	And if something does change, more often than not it just reminds you of feelings you've had all along.	Now, I would've never figured it out unless you guys had done the leg work. You four deserve all the credit, really.Mrs. Farr, Dr. Cox has saved the day! Don't ya just love it? Come here!
I don't _love_ Journey.	Bambi, not everyone loves Journey as much as you.	Marcia, please!No, I have not!	My name is Maureen McCormick.
"...Livin' in a lonely world! She took a midnight train goin' aaaanywheeeere!" Fine, I love 'em. If you wanna book the band, they're called The Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin's and they rock! Book 'em now, thank me later.	"She's just a small town girl..."	I don't _love_ Journey.	Bambi, not everyone loves Journey as much as you.
Lame!	There he is!	Probably cleans up the seal poop!	I've never been to Sea World. What exactly does Sean do here, anyway?
You should...talk to Carla....	You mean Tamika and Fuquan?	Anyway, about this whole setting the date thing: I mean, I'm really psyched for you guys, it's just gonna be harder and harder for us to hang out, you know? I mean, you're gonna be married, man! You're gonna have, like, a house! You know? You're gonna be spending your weekends chasing around little Arturo and Rosaria!	Wedding talk! Ohh, how lovely!
Turk, why are you so afraid of loving me?	Sounds like you're asking me out on a man-date.	You should...talk to Carla....	You mean Tamika and Fuquan?
See! This is the kind of stuff I'm gonna miss! The...the reminiscing...the way your breath always smelled of curry....	It was a very good day for me!	The point is, we were together so much, this one Indian girl only slept with him 'cause she thought his last name was "Anjadi".	We didn't have a car.
I was a cougar! Arrgh-arrgh-aaarrgh! See ya later.	Dude, you got your face painted at the hospital picnic.	I had a tattoo once.	Right. Listen, when you slice me up, make sure you don't mess up my tatt. my fiancé, Tracy, would kill me.
Sometimes you fight them not because you want to, but because you have to....	Can I have everyone's attention please? I officially don't care anymore who peed in this jar!	In a hospital, every day is made up of little battles.	No, ma'am.
Other times you fight for what you want...	Shut up.	Sometimes you fight them not because you want to, but because you have to....	Can I have everyone's attention please? I officially don't care anymore who peed in this jar!
...but what you want isn't willing to wait.	Sean, I can't make it to dinner.	Other times you fight for what you want...	Shut up.
If you're lucky, there's no battle at all everything works out perfectly.	Sure, Elliot...yeah....	...but what you want isn't willing to wait.	Sean, I can't make it to dinner.
Yeah, I'm so psyched we're doing this, man.	Hey! Turk-&-J.D.! And J.D.!	Yo, there he is! For a second I thought you weren't coming, dude.	If you're lucky, there's no battle at all everything works out perfectly.
But I thought we were gonna, like, reminisce tonight, you know? Get a little deep?	Dude, we left at the same time. I didn't know what to say to him.	You invited The Todd?	'Scuse me for a second, fellas. I'm gonna go over there and tell that girl my name's "Beer," then I'm gonna offer her some "beer nuts"! What's up!Mental five.
I'm not talking to you!	Aw, dammit all! I never tell you how _I_ feel.	You never tell me how you feel!	Why you making a big deal about this?
I don't understand. Ever since I met you it's been like this one-way street. I mean, I-I-I-I tell you everything, and you tell me nothing. I don't get it what are you afraid of?	Finally! Thank you.	I'm not talking to you!	Aw, dammit all! I never tell you how _I_ feel.
Well you're gonna be very pleased with the next twenty-three songs.	You know, I'm actually starting to like Journey.	I'm always happy when someone wins a battle. Because around here, you get your fair share of disappointment.I guess in the end you have to fight for things that really matter. Like pride in your work......or your friendship.	I gotta go.
You know, the fact that you're even here for an end-of-an-era celebration is enough we don't have to, like, get all deep or anything.	Heh.	Well you're gonna be very pleased with the next twenty-three songs.	You know, I'm actually starting to like Journey.
Uh-huh?	No, I wanna try this, man. Okay, Um.... Ever since Carla and I set the date for the wedding, I started thinking. You know those lame-ass couples that get engaged but they never actually get married they just cruise along, year after year, without making any real kind of commitment?	You know, the fact that you're even here for an end-of-an-era celebration is enough we don't have to, like, get all deep or anything.	Heh.
Hey, Puki, can we get two appletinis, please?	Dude, I wanted to be one of those couples, man!	Uh-huh?	No, I wanna try this, man. Okay, Um.... Ever since Carla and I set the date for the wedding, I started thinking. You know those lame-ass couples that get engaged but they never actually get married they just cruise along, year after year, without making any real kind of commitment?
You pulled the paper away!	Heh-hah-hah. You drew on the wall. You drew on the wall!	Like I said: Same ol', same ol'.	Charmed.
Dan, don't! That's dad's indelible space pen! And prom is in like two weeks!Good evening Mr. and Mrs. Shefford. I'm...here to pick up Amy for...prom.Yeah, that that'll come off you won't have to get laser surgery or skin from your ass or anything.	Stop lyin'. It's gonna come off, right?	You pulled the paper away!	Heh-hah-hah. You drew on the wall. You drew on the wall!
This guy needs courage.	These! Right here! You see these names!? They are called patients! This one needs brain work! This one needs a heart!	As third-year residents, you really have to stay on top of your interns.	Where the hell are my interns!?
...What?	No sweat. You should hear what they call Dr. Michead.	The girl one just called you "Dr. Jerk"!	Dr. Jerk!
Look, guys, I'm not here to overwork ya, okay? I'm not I'm not just your resident I'm your buddy, I'm your go-to guy.... I'm J.D.	I decided to take a different tack with my interns.	...What?	No sweat. You should hear what they call Dr. Michead.
Of course, my tack had its own drawbacks.	Look, guys, I'm not here to overwork ya, okay? I'm not I'm not just your resident I'm your buddy, I'm your go-to guy.... I'm J.D.	I decided to take a different tack with my interns.	...What?
But it is crucial I have everyone here at 9 a.m. sharp tomorrow, okay?	Of course, my tack had its own drawbacks.	Look, guys, I'm not here to overwork ya, okay? I'm not I'm not just your resident I'm your buddy, I'm your go-to guy.... I'm J.D.	I decided to take a different tack with my interns.
Absolutely. Anyone else need to be late?	Oh, uh...is it cool if I come at 9:30?	But it is crucial I have everyone here at 9 a.m. sharp tomorrow, okay?	Of course, my tack had its own drawbacks.
But I said 10!	I can be here at 9.	Okay, well, why don't we why don't we just make it 10, then? Okay?	Bad for me.
Do not miss that! It's awesome! Seth?	No, you let me go home 'cause I forgot to set my TiVo for the Styx 'Behind the Music'?	Jimmy, didn't you do one yesterday?	You did it for me both times.
Anyway, do you think we could, like, meet up after work or something?	....aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagggggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh-hagh-haaaaaaaaaaaaggggggggghhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!....	Elliot, uh, I need some pointers on how to deal with my interns.	Even though my interns sucked, I decided to turn it into a positive.
Okay, stay calm at least she's here, too.	You know, since he's a trainer, Sean is really good with behavior and communication. I mean, he helped me so much with my interns that I thought maybe he could help you with yours.	Hey, Sean's here, everybody.... Hey, Sean! Heeeyyy!	Oh, hey, J.D.
Oh, well, Sean! Unfortunately for me, my interns aren't mammals!	They're mammals, actually.	Okay, that's it. I-I-I'm sorry, Sean, I'm a doctor, okay? I-I'm teaching humans, not dolphins, okay? So it isn't really helpful for me to know what works on fish.	You know, I had the same problem when I started working with the dolphins
S-sh I don't care, Sean!Come on, Turk!	J.D., they are.	Oh, well, Sean! Unfortunately for me, my interns aren't mammals!	They're mammals, actually.
Love to!	J.D., could you walk my dog tonight while I have casual sex with your friend, Miguel?	Me!	Hey, who wants to help me move?
I know where it all goes...!	Hey. Who wants to help me move back?	Love to!	J.D., could you walk my dog tonight while I have casual sex with your friend, Miguel?
I'd like to think so.	Think about it, man. Cox has taught you the most since you've been here, right? Do you really think he gives a damn whether you like him or not?	I know where it all goes...!	Hey. Who wants to help me move back?
You're not pissed off? I'd be pissed off. Why aren't you pissed off?	Don't sweat it.	Sorry.	J.D., it's no big deal. We both know that it wasn't about that. Well, you...you like Elliot.
Ohh.... Cool.	I dunno. I guess I just...I don't see you as that much of a threat.	You're not pissed off? I'd be pissed off. Why aren't you pissed off?	Don't sweat it.
...I take care of those official things that just have to get done.	You got it, Bambi.	Carla, can you check room air pulse ox on Mrs. Shipp?	I've learned to make Dr. Cox's rants work for me.I catch up on paperwork; I look after patients...
_You're_ a jerk!	You're a jerk.	...I take care of those official things that just have to get done.	You got it, Bambi.
Crystal!	...Long story short, there, Molly, I will always whistle at you like you're a blonde with big bombs and I'm a construction worker just released from prison. That clear?	_You're_ a jerk!	You're a jerk.
Uh, listen, while I have you here I'm applying for a fellowship, and I could really use a letter of recommendation. I was thinking that, when you wrote it, instead of using a girl's name you could refer to me as "Dr. Dorian." I think it sounds a little more professional and, frankly, each time you call me a girl's name, I die a little inside.	Super!	Crystal!	...Long story short, there, Molly, I will always whistle at you like you're a blonde with big bombs and I'm a construction worker just released from prison. That clear?
I should get that tattooed on my neck.	Look, Janice, Denise, Tiffany Amber Thiiiieeeessen! Lemme go ahead and share a little something special with you that I like to call Perry's Perspective. One: If someone's standing in front of me in line at the coffee shop and they can't decide what they want in the half an hour it took to get to the register, I should be allowed to kill them. Two: I'm fairly sure if they took porn off the internet, there'd only be one website left, and it'd be called "Bring back the porn!" Three and most importantly of all: The only way to be respected as a doctor nay, respected as a man is to be an island; you are born alone, you damn sure die alone. Isn't that right, spike?The point is, and you just might want to jot this down: only the weak need help.	Uh, listen, while I have you here I'm applying for a fellowship, and I could really use a letter of recommendation. I was thinking that, when you wrote it, instead of using a girl's name you could refer to me as "Dr. Dorian." I think it sounds a little more professional and, frankly, each time you call me a girl's name, I die a little inside.	Super!
It's never fun being the fifth wheel, especially when one of those wheels is Elliot's boyfriend. Still, I had decided to take the high road.	Hey, you're not doing it right.	What the hell, that's not funny! All he did was this	All right.
That is diet....	Hey, J.D., is this regular? I asked you to bring me a diet.	It's never fun being the fifth wheel, especially when one of those wheels is Elliot's boyfriend. Still, I had decided to take the high road.	Hey, you're not doing it right.
It's a _riddle_. You figure it out.	So what are they?	Two coins add up to thirty cents and one of them is not a nickel.	Troy! We're listening.
Okay, fine. Lemme just fix my hair. Oh, wait!I don't have to!	Oh, gimme a break! I'll write whatever you want! Just...we gotta go.	Goodbye.	Oh, hell no!
Still, I don't even believe that you think asking for help makes you look weak; I think you don't do it because you're afraid of putting yourself out there. And that's why you're never gonna get anywhere.Thank you for this!	Look! He didn't apologize! So just back the hell off, okay!He messes up and I'm the one who gets...	You can't make me feel guilty for asking for help. That's just the way the world works, okay? A-and you know what? Most people actually like helping out the people around them.Take Carla, for instance! Don't you think she'd do anything in the world to help out Turk, no matter what the situation?	Tell you what, Newbie: This must be a very...very proud day for ya.
No. It's a riddle.	You lied to me.	Right. The _other one_ is.	Uh, no. Because you said one of 'em _isn't_ a nickel.
Pride's a funny thing....	Ooh! Your face is red! Like a strawbrerry!	No. It's a riddle.	You lied to me.
I still don't think I should go see her.	Say, Newbie, seeing as you are partially responsible for me being the new residency director, I'm gonna go ahead and give you the rest of the night off. I I I I don't know, it's just kind of my own personal way of saying...I can't actually stand the sight of you. Ha!	As for me, even if I wanted to put my pride on the line and go tell Elliot how I feel, I can't I have to work tonight.	Scalpel _what_?
And now, for a thousand dollars and this bag of I.V. fluid, which is guaranteed to make you feel like you're a hundred and ninety again, What did Peter Piper pick a peck of?	Pickles!	And to drink?	...Of course, it's harder if your patient suffers from dementia and can only say one word....
Oooooooh! I'm sorry, Mr. Bober! The correct answer is _peppers_. "Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled _peppers_."	Pickles.	And now, for a thousand dollars and this bag of I.V. fluid, which is guaranteed to make you feel like you're a hundred and ninety again, What did Peter Piper pick a peck of?	Pickles!
Huh?	NEWBIE!	Oooooooh! I'm sorry, Mr. Bober! The correct answer is _peppers_. "Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled _peppers_."	Pickles.
Yes....	Did I just walk in on you mocking an innocent patient!?	Huh?	NEWBIE!
And that's when I made one of the biggest mistakes I've made in some time....	My boyfriend Sean.	What?	J.D.... You know what I love?
I called my brother.	I'm really bummed out about Elliot. I just needed someone to talk to.	And that's when I made one of the biggest mistakes I've made in some time....	My boyfriend Sean.
And with that, I had reopened the door that I had successfully closed years ago.	Yeah, boo-frickin'-hoo. Listen, I'm so glad you called. You know how Mom's getting remarried again for the seventh time? Well, this is turning into such a hassle for me....	I called my brother.	I'm really bummed out about Elliot. I just needed someone to talk to.
Yes, it's killing me. So much so that I have to go, okay?	This whole Mom thing doesn't bother you?	Yes, Dan, I got your eleven messages. Now, because you're my brother, I'm gonna put this nicely: Leave me alone.	And with that, I had reopened the door that I had successfully closed years ago.
Wait! Dan! Hoog!	All right, buddy. I'll see you soon.Real soon.	Yes, it's killing me. So much so that I have to go, okay?	This whole Mom thing doesn't bother you?
Amy.	I know. But you know what? This is gonna be great. You know, this reminds me of the time I came down to see you guys when you were in med school.... Oh! And I hooked up with that slutty chick! Remember, the one with the huge cans? What was her name?	Oh, the audacity.	Ugh, yeah!To a loser! Total loser. This guy's making me move out of Mom's attic.
She was my girlfriend.	Yeah! How do you remember stuff like that?	Amy.	I know. But you know what? This is gonna be great. You know, this reminds me of the time I came down to see you guys when you were in med school.... Oh! And I hooked up with that slutty chick! Remember, the one with the huge cans? What was her name?
No.	Right.	She was my girlfriend.	Yeah! How do you remember stuff like that?
Turk! Can you please not put your skivvies in the freezer!? I'm sick of my popsicles tasting like fabric softener!	Ah! Come to papa!	I love the theatre....	You've always had the talent, little brother. You get in on this, and we could take this on the road!
They did?	Me neither! And you know what, J.D.? I'm worried, 'cause I think this marriage might actually stick.	This is a stimulating conversation. I can't imagine why Mom's new husband doesn't want you in the house.	Ahhhhhh!
Oh, that's great! I I guess you're only here because Mom wrecked the car?	Oh, yeah, yeah. Matter of fact, the only reason you were born is 'cause Mom bounced a check at the market.	They did?	Me neither! And you know what, J.D.? I'm worried, 'cause I think this marriage might actually stick.
Nah, usually I'm in there by myself.	Now, I heard there's a bed in the on-call room. You ever get, uh, hot & heavy in there?	Dan wanted to come with me to work today, but I told him it would make me a little uncomfortable. He was okay with it.	Mammogram-mobile. Well, not officially I just got the offer today but I'd make more money than I do now, riding around in an ambulance, and even though I'll be handling breasts all day, my beautiful fiancee, who is very secure with the will let meI ride around in an ambulance.
Oh, thank God.Dr. Cox! You remember my brother Dan?	So, yes.	Nah, usually I'm in there by myself.	Now, I heard there's a bed in the on-call room. You ever get, uh, hot & heavy in there?
Uh, Dr. Cox, Dan was wondering if he could trail with us today....	Snack cake.	Uh, Dan, why don't you go get a snack cake?	Oh, my ribs!
Look, Dr. Cox...	Good God in heaven, Newbie, there are just so very many ways for me to say this to you: Never; not in a million years; absolutely not; no way, Jose; no chance, Lance; niet; negatory; mm-mm; nuh-uh; oh-oh; and of course my own personal favorite of all time, man falling off of a cliff "Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!..."	Uh, Dr. Cox, Dan was wondering if he could trail with us today....	Snack cake.
I just want to say, thank you.	..."Pff."	Look, Dr. Cox...	Good God in heaven, Newbie, there are just so very many ways for me to say this to you: Never; not in a million years; absolutely not; no way, Jose; no chance, Lance; niet; negatory; mm-mm; nuh-uh; oh-oh; and of course my own personal favorite of all time, man falling off of a cliff "Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!..."
"Nooooooooo..." Heh. "Poof." Heh.	Hold the phone. You don't want him to come with us?	I just want to say, thank you.	..."Pff."
Well, I'm sorry, dude, I don't I don't have time for pickles right now. I got three vegetables and a drug addict who's gonna tell me this time things'll be different, then try to take my watch again.Dammit!	See, now that's just rude is what that is.	A gomer's an old person that takes up room in the hospital and doesn't have the common decency to die.	What's a gomer?
You know what, Dan, once Dad left and Mom started marrying everyone that rang the doorbell, I remember someone saying how lucky I was to have an older brother. But you never came through for me once, did you. I mean, I called you for help because I'm in love with a girl who's in love with someone else, and you responded by showing up here, drinking all my Bailey's Irish Cream, and whining about Mom's new boyfriend. You are a self-involved user, Dan. And you wanna tell _me_ what kind of person to be? I tell you what, instead, why don't you just get the hell out of my life?	Well, 'cause I'm worried about you. I mean, hanging with you today and watching you work, with the gomer talk and all the attitude now, I'm not so sure I like the guy you're turning into. It's definitely not my little brother.	Why!?	Yeah, actually, J.D., I don't think I'm leaving.
Not to me.	But we're brothers. That counts for something, right?	You know what, Dan, once Dad left and Mom started marrying everyone that rang the doorbell, I remember someone saying how lucky I was to have an older brother.

That way.So, you...taking off?	Well, isn't that perfect. You send your brother in to do the dirty work, huh? And with an open fly, no less!Made you look. A two-fer! Emergency Room?	Hey, Dan.	Waiting for my brother.
Look, um, Dan...I wanna apologize for everything I said. For what it's worth, I really like having you around.	Yeah.	That way.So, you...taking off?	Well, isn't that perfect. You send your brother in to do the dirty work, huh? And with an open fly, no less!Made you look. A two-fer! Emergency Room?
I know. I have dreams where I staple your fingers to your face.	No you don't.	Look, um, Dan...I wanna apologize for everything I said. For what it's worth, I really like having you around.	Yeah.
Here we go with this guy again.	Well, Mr. Pickles, welcome back.	As for me, it's enough just to love my brother, even though I know he'll never come up big for me.	I think he's got something stuck behind his big, sharp tooth.
No....	Yep. Still, it sure is nice to be doing something you love. I wouldn't trade it. How 'bout you?	Here we go with this guy again.	Well, Mr. Pickles, welcome back.
What are you doing?	Hey.	Still, I had my own problems.Even though she had a boyfriend, I was still crazy about Elliot. And, God bless her, she wasn't making it any easier.	Dude, you were wearin' a vest! Vesto!
Bunk with The Todd!	All the beds are taken. Scoot.	What are you doing?	Hey.
Oh! You wanted to keep talking?	Uh!?	Oh, hey Sean.	Hello? ... Sean!? Where are you? ... The west coast of New Zealand? I'm in the on-call room! ... Hey, J.D.'s here!J.D., say hi!
Todd! You're having a dream! Wake up!	How are you supposed to get over someone when you have to be around them all the time?This night could not get any worse.	Oh! You wanted to keep talking?	Uh!?
We'd still what?	We'd still die.	I guess people can surprise you.	No problem.
Me too.	If the elevator cable snapped, even if we timed it out perfectly and jumped up right before impact, we'd still be crushed to death. I wish I'd taken the stairs.	We'd still what?	We'd still die.
Inner monologue? Weirdo!	Sorry, sometimes I just have this inner monologue running through my head.	Me too.	If the elevator cable snapped, even if we timed it out perfectly and jumped up right before impact, we'd still be crushed to death. I wish I'd taken the stairs.
...God help him!	Oh, God help me.	You heard him, people! We're moving on!	Here that's a shame, because the whole dolphin thing used to make you so interesting. Too bad.
So, is there any chance of you guys getting back together?	Nooo. My sister just had a baby, so I'm doing the whole aunt thing.	Are you stalking me?	I don't mind it at the movies, sitting alone. But eating alone is sad and pathetic.
Yeah, it does. You know what we need to do? Uhh...?	Well, he's engaged, and he's getting married in two weeks...but, yeah, I think so.Unrequited love sucks, you know.	So, is there any chance of you guys getting back together?	Nooo. My sister just had a baby, so I'm doing the whole aunt thing.
J.D.	Danni.	Yeah, it does. You know what we need to do? Uhh...?	Well, he's engaged, and he's getting married in two weeks...but, yeah, I think so.Unrequited love sucks, you know.
Hi. Danni, we need to move on, okay? No more thinking about our exes; no more waiting for the phone to ring; no more stealing her purse just so you can return it later in the hopes that she'll be so grateful, she'll use the money recovered to buy you a drink and _maybe_ have sex with you after.	Hi!	J.D.	Danni.
I stole the wrong purse. ...And, yes!	Did that work?	Hi. Danni, we need to move on, okay? No more thinking about our exes; no more waiting for the phone to ring; no more stealing her purse just so you can return it later in the hopes that she'll be so grateful, she'll use the money recovered to buy you a drink and _maybe_ have sex with you after.	Hi!
She's dead.	Grandma Dorian.	Grandma Dorian or Nana Hobbs? Because Nana Hobbs can be an eensy bit racist.	I know you all think of me as some heartless monster; still, if your grandmother were here, wouldn't you want her doctor to spend as much time with her as he does with anyone else?
Sir, I don't think that's true.	The point is, sometimes what's best for this hospital _is_ what's best for the patients! I know it, you know it, and guess what, Dr. Cox knows it, too. Although damned if he doesn't disagree with me just because I said it.	She's dead.	Grandma Dorian.
Ooh, I can't. I got something really important to do.	Hey, you wanna go grab a cup of coffee?	See! That's what happens when you finally have the courage to cut the cord! Before you know it, you'll be ready for someone new to come along.	And I said, "Congratulations on the wedding, and I hope you two stay happy, and, by the way, size does matter."
It'll turn up....	Thanks, J.D. I am so tense. Someone stole my purse!	Ooh, I can't. I got something really important to do.	Hey, you wanna go grab a cup of coffee?
...Especially when it involves someone who's used to you following their lead.	Hey, Newbie, listen, I got dinner plans with Jordan, and seeing as you're on-call, whatta you say you pull up a chair, here, in front of Miss Bartow?	Of course, if the dynamic does change, it's never as simple as you'd hope.	Don't get me started.
I don't think so.	Maybe you didn't understand me, there, Violet. I don't want you leaving her side, even if someone thinks they saw Justin Timberlake downstairs. Now, dammit all, are you falling in line with me or not?	Look, Dr. Cox, I'll take care of her, and I'll have my interns help, but you gotta know I have other patients, too, so....	...Especially when it involves someone who's used to you following their lead.
No problem!	Well, I was hoping you wouldn't mind if I cut you out of it, and used it in a collage that I'm making for Sean?	Yeah.	Well, you know the picture of us at the beach, where I actually look good and you think that you look like Bjork?
Whoa.	Thanks!	No problem!	Well, I was hoping you wouldn't mind if I cut you out of it, and used it in a collage that I'm making for Sean?
It's going great, Danni! In opposite world!	How's the whole moving on thing going?	Whoa.	Thanks!
Probably not.	Well, I just wanted to say goodbye. I was gonna stick around for a few more days, but I don't really feel like that there's a reason to. ...Is there?	It's going great, Danni! In opposite world!	How's the whole moving on thing going?
I'm gonna miss you, too.	I'm gonna miss you.	Probably not.	Well, I just wanted to say goodbye. I was gonna stick around for a few more days, but I don't really feel like that there's a reason to. ...Is there?
Oh! That was good! No! No, I was doing the same thing!	Dude, we just met I was kidding.	I'm gonna miss you, too.	I'm gonna miss you.
Drive safe.	Adios.	Oh! That was good! No! No, I was doing the same thing!	Dude, we just met I was kidding.
She thought you were robbing the house.	I haven't had one this bad since your Nana Hobbs threw that rock at me.	So black people can get black eyes, too, huh? Who knew?	I told ya!
I think I do.	No. Well...yes, but I am honestly trying to tell you that I don't think I was being clear with you before. In fact, I think I was being a pretty lousy teacher. Look, I think putting one in the "win" column every now and then is what gives us the juice to keep plugging along in games that we know deep down we're not gonna win. And that's why I locked in so intensely to that patient. Because opportunities, they...God, they come along so rarely in this place. And when they do, you just can't let them slip through your fingers. You cannot. You know?	Here it comes. I'm incompetent. I'm a girl. I'm a little girl. I'm a little girl with pigtails that rides a tricycle.	I don't wanna see you around here anymore, okay?All right, come on you guys, you all got work to do!
DANNI!?	I wasn't sure what I was hoping for. ...That somehow Danni had decided not to leave...that she'd snapped her leg in the parking lot....	I think I do.	No. Well...yes, but I am honestly trying to tell you that I don't think I was being clear with you before. In fact, I think I was being a pretty lousy teacher. Look, I think putting one in the "win" column every now and then is what gives us the juice to keep plugging along in games that we know deep down we're not gonna win. And that's why I locked in so intensely to that patient. Because opportunities, they...God, they come along so rarely in this place. And when they do, you just can't let them slip through your fingers. You cannot. You know?
...All I knew was I'd missed an opportunity.	Yo.	DANNI!?	I wasn't sure what I was hoping for. ...That somehow Danni had decided not to leave...that she'd snapped her leg in the parking lot....
Excuse me!	Hey, J.D.	No one knew her last name, no one even remembered seeing her. I started to wonder if Danni was even real. I guess that's the thing about life. You don't really	Jackass!
Oh! Danni! Hi! I'm sorry, sometimes I have this inner monologue running through my head.	You don't really get many second chances.	Excuse me!	Hey, J.D.
Okay, two cups...and some pie.	I'm not gonna stick around for one cup of coffee.	Don't. Stay here with me, we'll get that cup of coffee.	I'm having dinner with my sister tonight, but I swear I'm leaving after that.
Oh, come on.	Oh, I see you've met my sister!	Finally, I found a girl with no complications.	Okay, two cups...and some pie.
Intense.	And...how was that?	He noticed her right away.And she noticed him noticing her.Their first date was amazing.They had so much fun together, they felt like kids again.Then it was time for their first kiss.	Okay. Once there was a beautiful girl who met a stunningly handsome young doctor....
The next date didn't start that well, either......but it got better from there.And that night, well...	Whoa! Woo! Agh!	Intense.	And...how was that?
...it was the most amazing night the young doctor ever had.	The next date didn't start that well, either......but it got better from there.And that night, well...	Whoa! Woo! Agh!	Intense.
And then the young doctor realized he hadn't seen the beautiful girl naked in the light yet.Damn!	And then what happened?	...it was the most amazing night the young doctor ever had.	The next date didn't start that well, either......but it got better from there.And that night, well...
If I wasn't crazy about ya, would I be willing to do this?Doom-doom, bah, do-doom-doom, dop-bop...	Are you as into this as I am?	And then the young doctor realized he hadn't seen the beautiful girl naked in the light yet.Damn!	And then what happened?
...doom-doom, dop-dop, doom	As I was doing the Naked Chicken Dance that my uncle Bart had taught me, I realized that life couldn't get much better than this.	If I wasn't crazy about ya, would I be willing to do this?Doom-doom, bah, do-doom-doom, dop-bop...	Are you as into this as I am?
My bad.It's a beautiful shot of you.	Okay! Now, just because Jordan thinks it's cute that you're violating her little sister doesn't mean that you can use my guest-room for your nerdy, G-rated sexcapades.	...doom-doom, dop-dop, doom	As I was doing the Naked Chicken Dance that my uncle Bart had taught me, I realized that life couldn't get much better than this.
"...waffles of mine..."	Stunning. Look, Tammy, as far as your love life goes, normally I couldn't care less who's laying your quivering body down by the fire while your lips whisper "No, no...no" but your eyes scream, "Yes. Yes. Oh, big daddy, yes!" But when you're dating Jordan's sissy-poo, it forces me to spend time with you outside of the hospital, and I just won't have that. So, hhhere's the deal: Don't want to have dinner with you. Don't want to go bowling with you. And I never, ever again want to walk into my kitchen and hear you say, "Ohh, it's waffle time! It's waffle time! Won't you have some waffles of mine?"	I always am.Ah! Ow!You know, I hit my head so hard I actually saw cartoon birds. Then I realized I was in Pediatrics and it was just the wallpaper! Ha!	Be brilliant today!
She's my patient!	Bottom line: We'll be bestest friends foreverest if you just keep your face out of my face. Uh-huh.Awwww.	"...waffles of mine..."	Stunning.

You know, if you leave it on the counter for an hour, you can just drink it like a milkshake. Except, watch out if that block's not totally melted, hits you in the face!	Hey guys, how are you? I'm great! You know me, I'm up, up, up, up, up, and then some fashion nazi on the E! Network says that pear-shaped people shouldn't wear stripes, and whoosh, guess who's ear-deep in mint-chocolate chip ice cream. Meheehee.	She's my patient!	Bottom line: We'll be bestest friends foreverest if you just keep your face out of my face. Uh-huh.Awwww.
Yeah, one time I got Chunky Monkey in my eye.	Oh, that'd go everywhere.	You know, if you leave it on the counter for an hour, you can just drink it like a milkshake.

Oh, uh, her landlord found her passed out on her floor.	What brings Ms. Tracy to us?	Yeah, one time I got Chunky Monkey in my eye.	Oh, that'd go everywhere.
A recent study found that doctors spend an average of fifteen seconds listening to a patient.It sounds insensitive, but the truth is it's all the time you need.	Yeah, lucky me, I couldn't pay my rent this month.	Oh, uh, her landlord found her passed out on her floor.	What brings Ms. Tracy to us?
I do. But I still love 'em!	You don't really puke at carnivals, do you.	The carnival!?Oh, I can't go to the carnival, Danni. I puke at carnivals...a lot.	Jordan just said we should all go to the carnival tonight.
That __is__ weird....	Well, you have done it. It's Friday night, and instead of being at home, drinking whiskey through my son's sippy cup, I'm actually at a carnival with you, surrounded by piles of manure even though I've yet to see a single animal!	Oh, yeah, it's only the back-and-forthy rides that get me.	So, we'll meet you guys on the Ferris wheel.Only if your stomach's okay.
First of all, I already raised the hammer; and the only reason I didn't ring the bell is that the game is obviously rigged.	Uh-huh. I'll tell you what, how 'bout we head right on over there, and if you can raise that hammer above your head with those chicken bones you call arms, I'll let you take a free whack at my dome.	That __is__ weird....	Well, you have done it. It's Friday night, and instead of being at home, drinking whiskey through my son's sippy cup, I'm actually at a carnival with you, surrounded by piles of manure even though I've yet to see a single animal!
Oh, come on!	Way to go, Gina!	Look, the only positive thing about this whole situation is that it's driving you crazy and there's nothing you can do about it.	Uh-huh.
...it can happen because of a mistake...	COULD YOU TAKE A LOOK AT MY EARS?	It can happen with a simple request...	Corn-dog!
Oh, thank God! Do you wanna get some pineapple pizza?	Look, you shoulda told me. But I'm not gonna let things like this mess it up with the guy I'm falling in love with.	Gotta stop showing that to new girlfriends!	J.D., you keep a sex journal of all your experiences under your bed.
That's robot for "Goodnight.""Peace!" Heh.	I think I'll probably just go inside and wash my feet.	Oh, thank God! Do you wanna get some pineapple pizza?	Look, you shoulda told me. But I'm not gonna let things like this mess it up with the guy I'm falling in love with.
I'm a girl, that's original.	Lovely. Here.Uh, actually there's great news, uh, Ms. Tracy: We're sending you home. Although, I sure wish we could have figured out how that stuff got introduced into your system to begin with. But sometimes in medicine you have to just chalk it up to life's great mysteries, like crop circles or this gal's Adam's apple.	You start and stop a lot.	Always fun to be in the bathroom listening to people talk so clearly, you're sure they just heard you pee. You did, didn't you.
Then what is it?	J.D., if I didn't go out with the guys my sister slept with, I wouldn't have even had a date to the prom.	Look, Danni, I know you're upset about your sister and I	I...I don't like her to be right.
"Thank you"?	Last night I told you I was falling in love with you. And you know what you said?	Then what is it?	J.D., if I didn't go out with the guys my sister slept with, I wouldn't have even had a date to the prom.
No.... _Pineapple_ pizza.	You asked me if I wanted to go get pizza.	"Thank you"?	Last night I told you I was falling in love with you. And you know what you said?
I guess the problem with only listening to a patient for fifteen seconds is, sometimes you don't hear everything...and when you finally realize what they were trying to say, you might've lost them forever.	We gotta go.	She did it to herself.	Oh, me? No, no, never my fiancé dumped me.I honestly can't remember the last time anyone was this nice to me.Hey, you guys, I just want to say, if I don't see you again, thanks and take care.
We need to talk.	Hey, guys!	Ms. Tracy.	I guess the problem with only listening to a patient for fifteen seconds is, sometimes you don't hear everything...and when you finally realize what they were trying to say, you might've lost them forever.
I'll try.	No, you have to earn it.	So say it again.	Ultimately, it keeps you in the moment...so you don't miss the things that really matter.
Yes, it was your bad, Carla.	My bad.	Carla! You can't ask a guy that while he's driving!	See ya!
I guess around here, you have to be prepared for anything.	Mind your own beeswax.	No it doesn't!	That means "nice haircut."
...Especially if you're dealing with a patient who needs emergency surgery.	Mmm, Britishy!	I guess around here, you have to be prepared for anything.	Mind your own beeswax.
Wow. You must be dancing on the wind right now.	What?	Turk!	Right on.
That is so fabulous!	Dude, today I had to sink or swim all on my own; and guess what? A brother swam.	Wow. You must be dancing on the wind right now.	What?
Yeah, but I didn't, like, make a big deal out of it.	I don't know.... I guess I just still don't feel like a doctor, you know? I mean, that whole thing with Turk today really got me thinking. Like, I've ran codes before, but there's always been someone right there ready to bail me out. Like, I've never had that one defining, sink-or-swim moment.	Why didn't you just tell him you were a doctor?	Thanks, man.
I won't, sweetie, trust me.	Danni, we should watch the movie in Turk's room, because he's gonna keep talking about the janitor, even though we begged him not to.	Yeah! It's just this whole janitor thing has thrown me for a loop.	"Day"?
I just wanna know what kind of freak needs to spend all day pretending to be somebody else!	Let's go.	I won't, sweetie, trust me.	Danni, we should watch the movie in Turk's room, because he's gonna keep talking about the janitor, even though we begged him not to.
Janitor!	Uh, listen, this is ____unit number 23. I got a possible sighting of Richard Kimball on northbound ______.Kimball!	I just wanna know what kind of freak needs to spend all day pretending to be somebody else!	Let's go.
Hey, everybody! She's cool with "Smelliot"!	J.D., I don't care if you call me that.	What is wrong with you? Is this because I called you "Smelliot"? Because I can't believe you haven't heard that before.	I guess I just love you so...much...?
Whatevah!	Dude, you can't _not_ think about her that way.	Can you believe her? She says I beat her to that code because I still have feelings for her. I don't even think about her that way anymore.	Him.
That's what's up.	Okay, think about her right now.Now think about her and Sean together.Now think about her and me together.	Whatevah!	Dude, you can't _not_ think about her that way.
Yeah....	Kissing her all three times, except the third time you were a black guy?	That's what's up.	Okay, think about her right now.Now think about her and Sean together.Now think about her and me together.
She was amazing.	Hurry! Faster!	Watching Elliot in there, I couldn't help but be impressed.	We're gonna need to do an emergency trach. Get the scalpel and the trach. kit. Go on.
Unfortunately, in medicine, even if you do everything perfectly......there are still no guarantees.	Let's go, you guys! Come on!	She was amazing.	Hurry! Faster!
Yeah.	Did you look then?	I looked because you did the "hey idiot" thing to me, like, six months ago.	Hey, idiot.I said "idiot" and you looked.
You know what? I think you're out of ways to bother me.	Heh.	Yeah.	Did you look then?
Think of a way to annoy me right now.That's what I thought.	No, you're wrong.	You know what? I think you're out of ways to bother me.	Heh.
Oh really, that's great, I hope they don't maul you.	J.D., Sean's gonna let me swim with the dolphins this weekend.	Elliot and her marine biologist boyfriend, at it again.So Elliot's marine biologist boyfriend comes back for the weekend just as my girlfriend leaves town for the holidays.But you know what? It doesn't bother me!	Come here, Aquaman. One more patient and then we're gettin' out of here.
Shouldn't you at least buy her breakfast?	Mrs. Cantwell, just have to give you a quick pelvic exam, so throw your feet up in these stirrups here and, uh, scoot your tushie down.Come on, Sean, let's go!	Yes! I knew you'd end up liking it!	You rang?
Elliot come on, I have never heard a woman make sounds like that!	That's great.	Oh, I'm sorry. What what's up? What's happening with the other thing?	Dude!
See, now you're just embarrassing yourself. Pick someone else to annoy!	You're stupid!	Thanks.	This guy's sick.
Yes, and there's an opening in surgery tonight, I managed to jam you in. Look, I know this is happening awfully fast, you must have a lot of emotions swirling around, but I want you to know if you have any questions at all, I'm here.	is _trying_ to say is that it hasn't spread to the lymph nodes yet, so it's still quite easily operable.	Ow!	No you're not. I think what Captain Bedside here
How's it going?	Oh, lookathat, message from Jordan.	Bravo, Tuesdays at 10, 9 central, 8 Mountain.	It's okay, tell him.
-Help me, help you-	Stop it.	Dr. Cox, we've known each other for over two years.... Let me in, okay? Help me help you. Help me help you, help me help you	Hey, watch it!
Well, that's easy! Just tell her about it. Tell her everything you feel.	Fine, Newbie! Let me let me tell you a little story. It starts every day at 5 in the morning which is just about the time that you're setting your hair for work when I am awakened by a sound: Is that a cat being gutted by a fishing knife? Nooo! That's my son. He's hungry and he's got a load in his pants so big that I'm actually considering hiring a stable boy. But, I go ahead and dig in; because I do love the lad and, well gosh, you know me, I'm a giver. And I'm off to the hospital, where my cup runneth over with both quality colleagues, such as yourself, and a proverbial clown-car full of sick people. But, what the hey, my pay is about the same as guys who break rocks with other rocks and I only have to work three or four hundred hours a week, so, so far I'm a pretty happy camper! And then I head back home where I'm greeted by the faint musk of baby vomit in a house that used to smell like, well...nothing! Nothing! Nothing! I-i-in fact it used to smell like nothing at all. And all I want to do before I restart this whole glorious cycle is, you know, maybe lay on the couch and have a beer and watch some SportsCenter and, if I'm not too sweaty from the day's labors, stick my hand right down my pants, buuut apparently that's not in Jordan's definition of "pulling your weight".	-Help me, help you-	Stop it.
First of all, no one understands relationships like Billy Joel, okay? "Uptown Girl" got me through high school long story for another day. Secondly, you don't want to end up like the Randolphs back there, just not saying a word to each other, do you?You wish _we_ were more like the Randolphs, don't you?	Should I give her every reason to accept that I'm for real?	Well, that's easy! Just tell her about it. Tell her everything you feel.	Fine, Newbie! Let me let me tell you a little story. It starts every day at 5 in the morning which is just about the time that you're setting your hair for work when I am awakened by a sound: Is that a cat being gutted by a fishing knife? Nooo! That's my son. He's hungry and he's got a load in his pants so big that I'm actually considering hiring a stable boy. But, I go ahead and dig in; because I do love the lad and, well gosh, you know me, I'm a giver. And I'm off to the hospital, where my cup runneth over with both quality colleagues, such as yourself, and a proverbial clown-car full of sick people. But, what the hey, my pay is about the same as guys who break rocks with other rocks and I only have to work three or four hundred hours a week, so, so far I'm a pretty happy camper! And then I head back home where I'm greeted by the faint musk of baby vomit in a house that used to smell like, well...nothing! Nothing! Nothing! I-i-in fact it used to smell like nothing at all. And all I want to do before I restart this whole glorious cycle is, you know, maybe lay on the couch and have a beer and watch some SportsCenter and, if I'm not too sweaty from the day's labors, stick my hand right down my pants, buuut apparently that's not in Jordan's definition of "pulling your weight".
So why don't you just, like, "take care of yo'self"?	I'm saying, this is torture!	Turk, it's been like eighteen hours since you had sex.	Dude, I'm dying here.
You don't?	Man, you know I don't do that.	So why don't you just, like, "take care of yo'self"?	I'm saying, this is torture!
Same here.	Nah, I only did that like twice in my life.	You don't?	Man, you know I don't do that.
I gotta go to sleep, I'm tired.	If by "in my life" you mean "since I got home".If by "in my life" you mean "since dinner".	Same here.	Nah, I only did that like twice in my life.
We gotta get that lock fixed.	Ohhhhh, my little newbie-doobie-doo! Say, that whole "telling Jordan how I feel" thing just went terrific, thank you for that. Now I need a place to crash. Where's Naomi's bedroom? Good night, roomies.	I gotta go to sleep, I'm tired.	If by "in my life" you mean "since I got home".If by "in my life" you mean "since dinner".
You know, Dr. Cox, I I know this is tough on you what with you being psychotic and all, but, I'm out, okay? It's 3 a.m. and there's nothing in the world that's gonna keep me from going to sleep right now.	Newbie, you told me to tell her exactly how I feel, I did just that. Now you'll remain on the floor until you come up with a new plan for me.	You told her that spending the day with the baby isn't really a job and that it's turned her into an inflexible shrew!	No you may not, on account of this whole Jordan situation being your fault.
I know there are possible side-effects, but the incontinence goes away with most patients, and sexual dysfunction can be treated with anything from Viagra to a penis pump.	Go.	Look, I	Whoa! Quick pause on the guttertalk! Catherine, hallway.
Doesn't have to be.	Penis pump? That sounds awkward.	I know there are possible side-effects, but the incontinence goes away with most patients, and sexual dysfunction can be treated with anything from Viagra to a penis pump.	Go.
"Doug, you better be careful, 'cause I'm Carla."Mr. Randolph.	That's what's up. Mm-mm. Mmm.	"Careful, Doug."	Careful Doug, we are not that close yet.
Then what is it?	I'm not scared.	Listen sir, I brought Dr. Turk here to help you get over your fear of surgery.	I was right, Catherine!
Maybe the dirty little secret about sex is that it isn't so dirty after all.	the walls come tumbling down. It's the one place that I can tell her how wonderful and beautiful she is, and how I would be lost without her. Now I know I will probably have to have this surgery eventually, but until then I am not going to risk losing the one thing that keeps me close to her. Not until I absolutely have to.Yes dear, you can come in.	Oh, God.	Wow.
Okay, so there's that.... Uh, look, I realize I let you down before, and I was thinking I could make it up to you by, you know, maybe baby-sitting sometime.	Whaaat?!	Uh, excuse me.	Oh, this is me mature. La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!
Sure. Just bring your own toilet paper. It's...kind of a little rule we have with our guests.Preferably something two-ply!	I gotta get out of there. You think maybe I could crash at your house?	Who?Owwwwwwwwwwww! ...Why?Powerful tiny fists....	Be careful, though, Randall got loose.
Dr. Cox said he liked me!?	How'd you get Dr. Cox to like you?	I already told her.	Oh, cool.... Bring toilet paper.
I need to know three things immediately: Where was he when he said it, what inflection did he use, and had he been drinking? You know what, I don't care about the third one; sometimes when you've been drinking you're the most truthful.	No, you're missing the point	Dr. Cox said he liked me!?	How'd you get Dr. Cox to like you?
You know what? I'm glad he was drunk.	Okay, look, I know Carla's gonna have her little pre-wedding panic attack, and what if she has her good ol' buddy Dr. Cox there to tell her what a jackass I am, huh? Then what?	I need to know three things immediately: Where was he when he said it, what inflection did he use, and had he been drinking? You know what, I don't care about the third one; sometimes when you've been drinking you're the most truthful.	No, you're missing the point
There'll be toilet paper everywhere!	For a while.Mmmmm, downy soft.	How long will you be staying?	Lookit, here's the rule, there, porn-star: The moment her toothbrush hits your sink, you've got yourself a permanent roomie.
There'll be banana hammocks everywhere!	Stop being such a fuddy-duddy! Now, who haven't I slept with yet?	Danni! Can you have the guys practice in the other room, please?	What the hell!? What's it gonna be like when she's at my place!?
Me too!	I feel really good about this!	And once in a while, you have to throw all the rules out the window and know that everything's gonna be okay.	That was worth the wait! You are a stallion!
With the long hours at a hospital, you don't have time to worry about your appearance.It may sound sexist, but with the female doctors, it's slightly more noticeable.	Easy, Moose , that stuff is forty bucks a tin.	Hold up!Chapped!	Uh-huh....
Because I'm I'm captain of m-m-my kite-flying team? The M-m-mighty Kites?	No. Why do you always ask me that!?	Hey, Janice. Is it windy out?	With the long hours at a hospital, you don't have time to worry about your appearance.It may sound sexist, but with the female doctors, it's slightly more noticeable.
Good morning, gentlemen.	Agh! Okay, just say something innocuous.	Because I'm I'm captain of m-m-my kite-flying team? The M-m-mighty Kites?	No. Why do you always ask me that!?
The truth is most of them don't even bother trying. Except of course...	Good morning, gentlemen.	Agh! Okay, just say something innocuous.	Because I'm I'm captain of m-m-my kite-flying team? The M-m-mighty Kites?
How do you have the time to look so good every morning?	Hey, girlfriends!	The truth is most of them don't even bother trying. Except of course...	Good morning, gentlemen.
Ooh!	Dude, relax. Enjoy the show. Have a Bugle.	Yeah. She wants to move in together. I have to break up with her!	Out of body experience?
Nothing.	What?!	I wanted to put them on my fingers and pretend I had witch nails.	J.D.!?
I was going to last night, but then I looked in her eyes, and I realized how rare it is to meet someone who's actually willing to have sex with me.	So, did you break up with her?	Hey!	To the morgue! Watch it!
Okay, you know how the, uh, couch in the living room has those high arms...?	How did you have sex with the woman you're about to break up with?	I was going to last night, but then I looked in her eyes, and I realized how rare it is to meet someone who's actually willing to have sex with me.	So, did you break up with her?
Mm, and I would love her, too.	It'd be awkward at first, but I'd make it work.... 'Cause I love my mom.	His mom doesn't die. Tyra uses her connections in the supermodel world to get government scientists to put Turk's mom's brain into Heidi Klum's body. She falls in love with me, we all move in together.	Tell her.
I thought you meant teammates!	At soccer camp, I told you I wanted to be more than friends.	Listen, Danni.......Lisa.... Drunk girl who was friends with the girl I really wanted to hook up with.... It's not all of you. It's me.Scott Gerber?!	Bambi, you owe her closure. Hell, you owe it to every woman you've ever dated.
He used to...borrow my jersey and wear it as jammies....	Well, I didn't!	I thought you meant teammates!	At soccer camp, I told you I wanted to be more than friends.
Actually, I'm kinda swamped right now, uh, let me get back to you, okay?Elliot, what's wrong?	I'm feeling really bummed. Do you have a second to talk?	I am trying to break someone's heart here, okay!?	The boy's got no biscuits.
Come on! I always have time for you!	Eh, forget it, you're busy.	Actually, I'm kinda swamped right now, uh, let me get back to you, okay?Elliot, what's wrong?	I'm feeling really bummed. Do you have a second to talk?
Turk, we tried playing Giant Black Guy. Remember what happened? People ran.	All right! My turn to get on top!	Hello, citizens! Welcome to Sacred Heart! Home of the world's most giant doctor! Be not afraid! I'm just like you! Except I'm giant!My tush is chafing.	They all had really important things to do?
Besides, I gotta go deal with this whole Danni thing.	Damn!	Turk, we tried playing Giant Black Guy. Remember what happened? People ran.	All right! My turn to get on top!
Nah, that's weak. I mean, if someone doesn't care about you enough to break up with you themselves, it's like they didn't ever care about you at all.	You want me to just talk to her for you? I'll do it.	Besides, I gotta go deal with this whole Danni thing.	Damn!
What?	Hey, guys. Ohh! J.D., Danni's breaking up with you. Mm, darn. See ya!	Nah, that's weak. I mean, if someone doesn't care about you enough to break up with you themselves, it's like they didn't ever care about you at all.	You want me to just talk to her for you? I'll do it.
Oooog! Oh, God....	Gotcha!	Look, do you know how hard it was for me to come here?	Danni's not here.
I just wanna know why she broke up with me.	What?	Say what you want, those big round cheeks are warm in the morning....	Get your coffee on, dawg.
Not cool.	Well, why don't you just...hey! Ask her yourself!	I just wanna know why she broke up with me.	What?
Listen....	You're dating a guy named Danny? Is he hot?	Maybe that's why Danni wants to break up with me, she thinks I'm too smart!	"What's up, doc?" I just got it!
Uh-oh.	I know it's a cliché, but ______ say that it is indeed the calm before the storm that lets you know that danger's coming.	Listen....	You're dating a guy named Danny? Is he hot?
Hey.After you dressed up Rowdy, did you trim the clumpy areas around his butt?	Hey.	After Dr. Cox exploded at us, so many thoughts were racing through my head: We have been slacking off lately. How did Doug get such incredible abs? And what the hell is the deal with Danni?	Clear!
Oh.... Thanks. He was due for a good grooming.	Yeah...?	Hey.After you dressed up Rowdy, did you trim the clumpy areas around his butt?	Hey.
Just tell me why.	Look....	Oh.... Thanks. He was due for a good grooming.	Yeah...?
What?	Your cell phone wasn't turned off.	Just tell me why.	Look....
Actually I'm swamped, Danni. Sorry, I gotta go.	When you called me.	What?	Your cell phone wasn't turned off.
Hey! I finally broke up with someone!	you're still not over Elliot. And until you are, no one's ever gonna have a chance to get close to you. Right?That silence? That's you breaking up with me.	Sorry.	J.D.
As for me, if I'm not over Elliot, I might as well wait it out for the long haul. After all, it doesn't mean I'm gonna ignore opportunity if it falls in my lap.	I I know what you're thinking, believe me, I...I do: Why in the world would a civilized, up-town man of the millennium such as myself even go ahead and give a good rat's ass about whether a bunch of snot-nosed baby docs were afraid of him. Right? Well, unfortunately the only way I know how to teach is through fear.And again, sorry about the gay sailor's outfit. Your mother _loves_ it. She couldn't be more pleasant when you have it on. Take it off nut bag. Have it on pleasant, approachable....	Everybody has their own way of getting through the day.For some, it's as simple as standing up for a friend......and getting away with it.	I look hot!
Piss off, Mickhead.	Free help, here.	They won't leave me alone.	No thanks, Dr...whatever your name is.
Dr. Cox? I could use a little help.	You'd think by now they'd know where I'm gonna end up.	Piss off, Mickhead.	Free help, here.
Yeah, if you wanna use the appearance angle to knock down my self-esteem, best to do it on a day when my hair doesn't look awesome! I know it's new wax.	Beyoncé, you could use a lot of help. But, hey, we all have to play the hand the Big Guy dealt us. You know, unless you're lucky enough to have those insanely over-hyped 'Queer Eye' guys show up at your door, but I doubt even they have the brass ones necessary to fix whatever the hell this is.	Dr. Cox? I could use a little help.	You'd think by now they'd know where I'm gonna end up.
It's okay to want a piece!I just want you to check out Mrs. Barlow's chart; I'm always second-guessing myself when it comes to interstitial lung diseases.	What is?

Got it.	Oh, then you should definitely handle this yourself, there, Britney.	It's okay to want a piece!I just want you to check out Mrs. Barlow's chart; I'm always second-guessing myself when it comes to interstitial lung diseases.	What is?
Oh.	Noo.... I'm a good doctor.	Got it.	Oh, then you should definitely handle this yourself, there, Britney.
Solo-Flex...	Really big trucks...	Oh, that's fine. We were talking man talk...you know....	Oh.Ye oh, sorry about the girl talk.
Sweat.	Have you seen these lately?	Solo-Flex...	Really big trucks...
Well, your breath smells like chimichangas!	Your hair smells like Elliot's.	Sweat.	Have you seen these lately?
...Fine. A super-doc with obsessive-compulsive disorder.	Dammit!	I think what Carla really smelled was all the excitement in the air. See, there's a visiting professor coming today who's both a medical attending and a surgeon. _Two_ specialties, and to us that kinda makes him......Super-Doc!...Super-Doc...	Maybe....
The jar said unisex.	That's very pretty. And deeply disturbing.	Huh?	Hers.And his.
_Unisex_.	I know.	The jar said unisex.	That's very pretty. And deeply disturbing.
Dammit!	I know.	_Unisex_.	I know.
I know. I always talk like this.	It's not a secret.	It's just that you're...you're a doctor with pretty severe OCD.	Dr. Kevin Casey.... Dr. Kevin Casey.It's okay, you can say it.
I can do it!	You're gonna have a hard time keeping that up the whole month I'm here.	I know. I always talk like this.	It's not a secret.
Loved pirates! Just like me!	What?	Was the blond hair and the earring 'cause you were in a rock band or 'cause you loved pirates?	Shut up, jackass! I rock!
Well you're the only one. Okay?	I _don't_ want a piece.	Loved pirates! Just like me!	What?
Dr. Cox, you are not now, nor will you ever be, my mentor.	Look, Pink, for the billionth time, no, I will not go out for a beer with you. Now repeat after me: Dr. Cox, you are not now, nor will you ever be, my mentor.	Well you're the only one. Okay?	I _don't_ want a piece.
You are unflappable!	Okie-dokie, artichokie.	It's a great sign.	Suicidal scavenger birds also an excellent sign, right Doctor?
I'm more skittish.	It's true I can't be flapped.	You are unflappable!	Okie-dokie, artichokie.
I wish a was a swashbuckling doctor. You know...like a pirate.	Yeah, you know, you're like a big squirrel.	I'm more skittish.	It's true I can't be flapped.
You going to the, uh... O.Arrr? Heh.	Ahoy, there.	Enough about pirates! Wait until you know him better.	I wish a was a swashbuckling doctor. You know...like a pirate.
Dr. Casey.	You know, I couldn't have survived in medicine if I didn't embrace my OCD. And since I was compulsive anyway, you know, I I read the same text books over and over, I, uh, I went through the procedures over and over, I imagined every worst-case scenario over and over and over and over and over and over and over	I said enough!	You going to the, uh... O.Arrr? Heh.
Dr. Casey!	and over and over and over	Dr. Casey.	You know, I couldn't have survived in medicine if I didn't embrace my OCD.

Oh.	Dr. Kevin Casey.	Dr. Casey!	and over and over and over
Yeah.	Thank you.	Oh.	Dr. Kevin Casey.
It's weird, after one day it already felt like he was the type of mentor I always wished Dr. Cox would be. Still, I've gotta stay cool; I know I'm prone to hero worship.	Even though my crazy brain made me do those things, it's still the best advice I can give to any young doctor: Expect the unexpected and you will never be surprised.	Yeah.	Thank you.
Really? 'Cause I don't feel the daaaaaaaiiiiiioooooooowwww...heh-heh-how cool is thaaaat!	Man, the surgeon in me is antsy. I need to cut somebody up.Thanks for volunteering. I'm not really that strong on the brain. I think this is the language center.	It's weird, after one day it already felt like he was the type of mentor I always wished Dr. Cox would be.

BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!	The sheep says...	MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!	The cow says...
The French would help with the ladies....	Ladies and gentlemen, Macaulay Culkin...	BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!	The sheep says...
Eye contact! He respects me!	Thank. You.	Here's that CT scan you ordered!	I know. But soon enough I established myself as the best damn doctor that ever roamed around these filthy halls; which is a curse, actually, because now I'm expected to make eye contact with every insult to medicine that comes into this dump.
...but I knew I had him.	Noo.... I'm a good doctor.	You really had trouble with metabolic diseases?	I don't know why it popped into my head...
Yeah.... Reminds me of my first girlfriend. She was a carnie.You know, I'm always trying to get Cox to come out and get a beer with me he never does.	Nice place. It's got that that great...vomit and peanut smell.	Funnier still how the same guy could be the mentor I've always been looking for.	Yep. He's out of our league.
Ahhhh, perfect!Well, I don't carry anything around....	Hey, you're not one of those guys who carries around pictures of him and his attending, are you?	Yeah.... Reminds me of my first girlfriend. She was a carnie.You know, I'm always trying to get Cox to come out and get a beer with me he never does.	Nice place. It's got that that great...vomit and peanut smell.
Totally.	Good. 'Cause you know, those those losers who've been practicing medicine for three years but are still looking for some kind of mentor to pat 'em on the back are just...pathetic, you know what I mean?	Ahhhh, perfect!Well, I don't carry anything around....	Hey, you're not one of those guys who carries around pictures of him and his attending, are you?
I think when rational men are forced to face their shortcomings they all do the same thing: Blame Kevin Casey! Who gave him the right to judge me? 'Cause I sure didn't! I'll give him a piece of my mind! See how he likes it! Unfortunately no one knew where the son of a bitch was!	Okay.	Doug, get the hell outta here!	I've always felt like Doug understood me. It's weird; after knowing him for three years, I suddenly realized he was the type of mentor I always wished Dr. Cox would be.Wait!
Sorry, sir.	Dr. Dorian! I'm far too irritable right now to pretend I don't hate you, so let's cut to the chase.If you know where all the garbage in this hospital is going, I'll give you......eight dollars.

I'm sorry....	I'm sorry. I just, I... Look, I spent the last few days meeting new people and...trying to get used to this place, and I'm stressed and I'm fried......and I just want to go home.... But here's the punchline: even though my last surgery was two hours ago, I can't stop washing my damn hands.AAAAAAAAGGGGGGGHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!	Later's cool too.	DAMMIT!
Nothing.	No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look...this is a weak moment. Nobody's supposed to see this. And, uh, mark my words, I'll clean up the soap. ...Probably several thousand times.Everyone's got their own burdens, J.D., and I'm not gonna be one of those people that dumps mine on somebody else. Now whatta you need?	I'm sorry....	I'm sorry. I just, I... Look, I spent the last few days meeting new people and...trying to get used to this place, and I'm stressed and I'm fried......and I just want to go home.... But here's the punchline: even though my last surgery was two hours ago, I can't stop washing my damn hands.AAAAAAAAGGGGGGGHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
Who'm I gonna tell?	Listen, pal. I don't want you telling anybody about my epiphany toilet.	Damn him. He's right.	You kiddin'? Oh, man! Just picture yourself, you're standing out here, in the open air, then you sit down and you take stock of your life.
And get this: He calls it his "epiphany toilet"!	Ehp! Don't even think about it!	Who'm I gonna tell?	Listen, pal. I don't want you telling anybody about my epiphany toilet.
Yep, that's what he said.	Using that toilet would be my Everest.	You're like Dr. Casey. I think he said using that toilet would be like his Everest.	No one's offering.
Oh.	Will you be my best man?	Oh, my God! _Would_ I have a threesome with Turk and Carla? Well, it's certainly flattering, and I don't think they'd tell anyone....	Turk wants to ask you something, and it would mean a lot to the both of us if you said yes.
I mean, YEAH! Of course!	Huh?	Oh.	Will you be my best man?
Thank you so much!	Hell yeah, you will!	I mean, YEAH! Of course!	Huh?
It finally happened!	What?	A decoder ring! Heh.TURK!	So is this, like, the best moment you guys have ever had?
Thanks. Thanks for coming back.	Newbie! It turns out I, uh, I do have some best man advice. Go easy on the mascara in case you cry during your toast. And if you're gonna chase after the bouquet with all of the other girls, make sure you kick off your pumps so you don't snap one of those chicken ankles of yours.	Probably.	Why can't I sit on you!? Why?
Even if you've done a procedure five thousand times, there's no guarantee you won't screw up number five thousand, one.	Barbie. Are you sure you went into his lungs? 'Cause it looks like you're blowing up his stomach.Aw, dammit, his O2 sat's dropping. Get out of the way, honey; come on.	Thanks. Thanks for coming back.	Newbie!

Can I practice my toast on you?	A few more seconds, we would have been coding this guy.Barbie, as hard as it is to remember, but _air_ goes in _the lungs_.

I can't reach!	Put one hand on the floor!	It _is_ hot!	Okay, ready? Five, six, seven, eight.And one, two, three, four, five six, seven, eight.
I can feel it burning!	You better feel the burn!	I can't reach!	Put one hand on the floor!
Well, we grew up in ...	Where I grew up, they didn't allow two men to marry.	I can feel it burning!	You better feel the burn!
...There you gotta do things like test suits out...	Well, shoot, I grew up in the 'hood ...	Well, we grew up in ...	Where I grew up, they didn't allow two men to marry.
Uh.... I'm the best man. Do you have any advice for me to give my friend?	...That's right.I'ma go change.	...There you gotta do things like test suits out...	Well, shoot, I grew up in the 'hood ...
Yeah, I'll make sure and do that.	Just remind him over and over that the wedding is all about what the woman wants.	Uh.... I'm the best man. Do you have any advice for me to give my friend?	...That's right.I'ma go change.
No, why?	Did you tell anybody about my epiphany toilet?	What now?	Cool.
AGH!	'Cause I need to, uh, talk to you in private? Sort of man to man?	Phew! False alarm.	Have you seen Carla around?
So I can get to my patients faster.	You're drawing lightning bolts on your Nikes.	I can't right now, Turk. I am completely swamped.	AGH!
Later's no good, dude. I gotta stop by the tux shop, then I gotta finish telling my whole family that you picked me as your best man!	How 'bout later?	So I can get to my patients faster.	You're drawing lightning bolts on your Nikes.
Cool. I'll see you tomorrow.	Yeah-heh. I have to go.	You should see us gettin' down when we try pants on together.	Oh, yeah, nice guy...good surgeon...great dancer.
Why? Why do you have to do that?	Uh, actually, no. I got a call I have to go back to my hospital.	Cool. I'll see you tomorrow.	Yeah-heh. I have to go.
I know.	Well, look at it this way: Uh, I may be leaving here, but I will always be there.	Why? Why do you have to do that?	Uh, actually, no. I got a call I have to go back to my hospital.
Ha, I know.... Okay. Well, sir, it was amazing to work with you.	I am so messing with you.	I know.	Well, look at it this way: Uh, I may be leaving here, but I will always be there.
Okay, sorry.	Thank you.And that's three seconds!	Ha, I know.... Okay. Well, sir, it was amazing to work with you.	I am so messing with you.
Watching Kevin go, I wondered how gay I looked giving that two-handed handshake. And also how weird it was that someone could just walk into your life, have such a big impact, and then vanish just like that, never to be seen again.But mostly I thought about how, in some small way, Kevin had helped every single person he met here.	Okay.	Okay, sorry.	Thank you.And that's three seconds!
He didn't help a lot of people, Elliot. It was just me, and Turk, and Carla, and Dr. Cox, and Doug, and Dr. Mickhead	Look, I don't wanna sound pathetic, but, he didn't even help me.	I haven't seen them.	Where my hos at?
_Was_ in rehab, Elliot. Was. He'll never huff paint again.	Mickhead? No, Mickhead's in rehab.	He didn't help a lot of people, Elliot. It was just me, and Turk, and Carla, and Dr. Cox, and Doug, and Dr. Mickhead	Look, I don't wanna sound pathetic, but, he didn't even help me.
There's Turk. I gotta go.	All right, see, with intubating....I can't seem to intubate patien	_Was_ in rehab, Elliot. Was. He'll never huff paint again.	Mickhead? No, Mickhead's in rehab.
I wanna say tennis....	Which sport are we talking about?	Yeah, me too.	With Marbury, I really believe New York has a shot at the title, man.
It's always uncomfortable when two guys wanna say something each other.	The only reason I asked my brother to be best man was because I knew he couldn't come to the wedding. But now his plans have changed and he's all excited. Dude, it has to be you, you know that.	I wanna say tennis....	Which sport are we talking about?
Solid.You know, if it makes it easier, I guess we could be co-best men.	Dude, look, man, you're my friend and I frickin' love you; and no one's looked out for me like you have.Cool.	Look, you've been my best friend for ten years, man; I've loved you since college, and you know I'd do anything for you.	It's always uncomfortable when two guys wanna say something each other.
...Even though...God said it's supposed to be one....	You have no idea how much stress that would relieve.	Solid.You know, if it makes it easier, I guess we could be co-best men.	Dude, look, man, you're my friend and I frickin' love you; and no one's looked out for me like you have.Cool.
No reason.	Dude. Why is your tux gonna cost four thousand dollars?	I think it's human nature to search for answers.	I can't believe it's gone.
I guess the important thing is to never stop searching.	Well done, there, Barbie. You're now exactly where you were three years ago.	But more often than not, the answers we've been looking for have been inside us all along.	Dairy Queen!
I'll help you. Nah. Okay.	Occupied!	I guess the important thing is to never stop searching.	Well done, there, Barbie. You're now exactly where you were three years ago.
It was a gift.	Hup-pah-bah! Would you zip it, nerd? The only reason I invited you is	Will there be a piñata? Because I need to know if I should bring my piñata helmet.	How about a Russian Roulette booth? And here's the kicker. We put bullets in ALL the
Why not?	Anyhoo. I'm thinking that you probably shouldn't come.	From me to me.	It was a gift.
I can't!	Oh. Bloody. That's good. Now this time, try and do it with your	Thorns! Ah! Augh! Ow! Ouch! Ah!	No.:
Can I see that for one second?DRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!	That's perfect.	I can't!	Oh. Bloody. That's good. Now this time, try and do it with your
I need to get it started first.	Not a strong moment for you, Polly.	Can I see that for one second?DRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!	That's perfect.
I have to get going.	You know something? You have slept with both of my sisters. That means you	Is this thing made of Teflon?	Uh-huh.
For the life of me, I can't figure out his irregular heartbeat.	Hiiiiii.	Dr. Cox, I can't. I'm already covering for Doug. He's on a His-and-Her Spa Day withDon't ask. The point is, I'm swamped. And I'm a little worried about Mr. Taylor here.Mr. Taylor.	Only me. Long story short, your new job is to take young Ben here by the hand and
Twenty minutes after you left, he went into cardiac arrest.	What's the matter with you there,	Dr. Cox.	That hurt here,
So wait. You think this was my fault?	Not anymore. I'm taking all your patients.	I'm on call tonight.	What are you still doing here?
Thanks. I really needed to hear that.	Look, I just want to say. That what happened. Wasn't your fault. And I'm	You know, you're right. I was an idiot to buy these shower shorts. I mean, it's not like	Those are the most ridiculous things I have ever seen.
Where do you think we are?	You know. Crying babies. Covered in chocolate. People singing	Pictures of what?	Now, where is your camera? Aren't, aren't you going to take some pictures?
The...reason Turk's in such a rush is because he's starting a rotation with the hospital's new attending surgeon.	Booga! Booga! Booga! Booga!Wooo! Ack!	Every time Turk's in a hurry, I'm always tempted to jump out and scare him. Well, today's the day!	I'll handle this. I think what Garfunkle here is trying to say is that you should all take a second, think seriously about what's really bothering you, and then have a big group unbunching of your panties.
I could tell what the guys were thinking.	So.... You guys my new residents?	The...reason Turk's in such a rush is because he's starting a rotation with the hospital's new attending surgeon.	Booga! Booga! Booga! Booga!Wooo! Ack!
So, uh, Jordan seems to be doing pretty well.	Right! Let's go and get drunk before pilates!	You know, down the street on the right, they'll make an appletini that'll knock your socks off.	Where can one get a nice gin and tonic?
How 'bout you? How you holding up?I...I know it's been kind of tough with Ben dying.Are you gonna talk ever?	You know Jordan, she is a rock.	So, uh, Jordan seems to be doing pretty well.	Right! Let's go and get drunk before pilates!
That's a beautiful sentiment.	Let me go ahead and tee this up for you, there, Annika: We are all going to die someday. For the lucky few of us it'll be nice and fast. But for most of us it'll be just as long and slow and painful as a conversation with you.	How 'bout you? How you holding up?I...I know it's been kind of tough with Ben dying.Are you gonna talk ever?	You know Jordan, she is a rock.
No, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no switchies. I think we should all be happy with the bras God gave us! I really should go.	Damn. Let's switch.	Ohh, yes.	Does this bra make my boobs look real?
Well, you wouldn't see my face because it would be buried in your chest, giving you the hug you've been afraid to ask for your whole life!	Then for the last time, don't stick any part of your hairless body into my business. Trust me, there is nothing for you to gain from it. Because even if you went on a cruise to the most remote regions of the ocean and rescued my drowning, salt-soaked body in time to pump the sea water out of my lungs and bring me back from the brink of death, I would STILL be upset that the first face I saw was yours!	Actually, yes. I caught the matinee of that show; definitely not for the whole family.	May I ask you something, there, Judy? Do you have any idea what it's like to have three angry, under-fed women tear you several new ones for a full hour?
Now, if you don't want my help, then fine, I'll back off.... But only because I feel a little bit guilty.	Huh!	Well, you wouldn't see my face because it would be buried in your chest, giving you the hug you've been afraid to ask for your whole life!	Then for the last time, don't stick any part of your hairless body into my business. Trust me, there is nothing for you to gain from it.

Yes! He fell! I'm gonna get away!	Move, Barbie! Move! Barbie!	Aaaaaaaaagggggggghhhhhhh!	Dr. Reid! I've seen you strutting around this place with your can-do attitude, and I know that you think because you're a female doctor, you're part of the solution. But you're not. Everything about you screams, "What does the cutie in Radiology think about me?" And yes, your friend Dr. Turk, he may ask you relationship advice or where to get his unfortunate girlfriend some naughty lingerie because we both know that when it comes to gifts, women all crave a nice leather push-up bra with tassels that go around and around and around like this but still, I ask you, is that _respect_?Uh, don't answer. I don't care!
Well, uh....	Come on!	Ack!	Like you read about.Come here, you.
Dr. Cox had nothing to do with me going to see your scary friends. I did it all on my own.	Spill.	Well, uh....	Come on!
Oh, oka that's going in the box. Girl's names are out. That's why we have a box.	Why don't you grow a pair, Sally!	You okay?	Fine. You want some straight shootin'? I'm glad that you're dealing with Ben's death so well. The fact is I'm strugglin'. And having those two harpies nesting in our home is not helping. For the life of me, Jordan, I cannot figure out why they're still here. It is beyond me!
Why don't you just use Power Rangers?	Ohhh, where's my lucky Tabasco 'do-rag!?	...and then their own personal good luck rituals.	Dude! Too deep!
You remember when communications with Zordon went down and the Megazord was destroyed?	How are Power Rangers as lucky as Tabasco?	Why don't you just use Power Rangers?	Ohhh, where's my lucky Tabasco 'do-rag!?
Power Rangers, hoooaaa!	How did I miss that episode? Ohh, that's right I was making love to a woman.	You remember when communications with Zordon went down and the Megazord was destroyed?	How are Power Rangers as lucky as Tabasco?
So why don't you just take off your underwear?	Question: Did he die? Answer: No, he did not. The point is, I gotta stick with whatever's hot. Like last month, it was not wearing any underwear.	Are you counting the boil you lanced yesterday?	Since I been wearing that Tabasco 'do-rag, my surgery record's like 23 and 0.
Todd knows about the underwear thing?	That's what I keep telling him!	So why don't you just take off your underwear?	Question: Did he die? Answer: No, he did not. The point is, I gotta stick with whatever's hot. Like last month, it was not wearing any underwear.
He's back.	Hm!	Powerful, tiny fists....	I felt it!
She did it!	Okay, who do I kill?	Uncomfortable!	...It sets everything else in motion.
Uh-oh. You've gotta cover for him.	Where the hell is Dr. Cox? His shift started four minutes ago!	And insignificant events can lead to significant events.Like me being on time and Dr. Cox being late for a change.	I would love to, Darlin', but I'm a little bit busy right now.
Yes, sir!	Dammit, son, are you listening to me?	Have to learn to play the banjo.	Uh-oh. You've gotta cover for him.
And here he is!	Hey, fellas. What'd I miss?	And _buy_ a banjo.	Yes, sir!
Well, I'm a lefty.	Nice grab.	Uh, Dr. Kelso? That's my pen.	You know, Perry, since Dr. Dorian was on time and you were busy in the break room coming up with that hilarious "better-worse" bit, maybe you should answer to him all day.
It's your show, Debbie. Is this moment just like you always pictured?Stupid homemade dolls....It's a little bigger...?	You know, my head's probably going to melt when I say this but Kelso's idea wasn't half bad. Letting you run this place for a day would be a great educational experience. And, come on, let's face facts the training bra's got to come off eventually. So, it's your show, Debbie. Is this moment just the way you always pictured it?	Well, I'm a lefty.	Nice grab.
Come on...you can do this. Navy scrubs! Navy scrubs! Navy scrubs!	Sounds to me like angina.	Sounds to me like a G.I. bleed.	Yes. Yes, you are. Fortunately, though, your vitals are normal, so we'll check back with you in a little while.
I don't like candy bracelets.	Oh, I-I-I'm sorry. Here I was in my own little world, talking to myself and dreaming about candy bracelets.	Hhhheeeere's the deal, Eleanor: We're gonna go ahead and get a full work-up on this guy. So, while I drop an NG tube and do a gastric lavage, why don't you go ahead and get an order on EKG with cardio biomarkers. If you need to know where those are, they're on page 37 of the Ann Taylor catalog right next to that salmon cable-knit sweater you've wanted for so long but haven't had the courage to order...'cause you're worried the weave's so thin, your nipples might just go ahead and peek their little pink selves through. Isn't that right, Dr. Cox....Dr. Cox...	Come on...you can do this. Navy scrubs! Navy scrubs! Navy scrubs!
Good day.OW!How you like me now?	I love them!Now you gotta grab that elevator. But not without giving him his patented shoulder bump!	I don't like candy bracelets.	Oh, I-I-I'm sorry. Here I was in my own little world, talking to myself and dreaming about candy bracelets.
No hair!	Y-nuh-uh.	Brown hair?	No.
Yeah, that's from the dryers.Hey! You know, the janitor's still downstairs. Why don't we just check his custodial closet?	That's the one.	No hair!	Y-nuh-uh.
So that's why he's been back in my dreams....	Just got the job, brah.	Randall?!	'Sup.
Gotta go.	Beat it.	So that's why he's been back in my dreams....	Just got the job, brah.
Uh...let's get him a CT angiogram stat.	Come on, come on, come on! We gotta make a decision here.	I don't get it, he wasn't showing any signs of distress!	No pulse in lower extremities.
Call surgery. Tell 'em we're on our way.	Good.It's an aortic dissection. It's bad.	Uh...let's get him a CT angiogram stat.	Come on, come on, come on! We gotta make a decision here.
Me, I don't believe in fate. I believe we have more control than we think, and that every action has a reaction. After all....The most minor event even a butterfly flapping its wings can change everything. Sometimes for the better. Even if it doesn't seem like it at first.	Lookit, it's just that aortic dissections are a doctor's worst nightmare. If you don't catch 'em early, there's about a ninety percent mortality rate. I mean, honestly, unless your patient was lucky enough to trip and fall into a CAT-scan machine, he wasn't gonna have a happy ending. Newbie, we didn't have a chance on this one.	...or even letting down someone you barely knew at all.In the end, it's the "what ifs" that hurt the most. Like, what if things had gone a little differently?	Turk, I'm sorry!
I can't.	Look away.	Me, I don't believe in fate. I believe we have more control than we think, and that every action has a reaction. After all....The most minor event even a butterfly flapping its wings can change everything. Sometimes for the better. Even if it doesn't seem like it at first.	Lookit, it's just that aortic dissections are a doctor's worst nightmare. If you don't catch 'em early, there's about a ninety percent mortality rate. I mean, honestly, unless your patient was lucky enough to trip and fall into a CAT-scan machine, he wasn't gonna have a happy ending. Newbie, we didn't have a chance on this one.
Fresh start.	You are right. We need a fresh start. Come on.	Heh. So charming. Could you be half as nice to me as you are to her?	I'm blushing.
How long do ya...suppose this'll be?	Mm-hmm.I think we need a longer fresh start.	Fresh start.	You are right. We need a fresh start. Come on.
And insignificant events can lead to significant events.Like me being late because I was in the world's longest handshake.	Probably ten minutes.Ease into it. Let's mix it up let's saw some wood. There we go. Nice. Very good.	How long do ya...suppose this'll be?	Mm-hmm.I think we need a longer fresh start.
I should get Turk a washboard!	Take a wild guess.	Sorry I'm late. What'd I miss?	And insignificant events can lead to significant events.Like me being late because I was in the world's longest handshake.
I'm a righty.	Nice grab.	Uh, Dr. Kelso? That's my pen.	Maybe so, but I started those things promptly at 8.
Whatever. Just avoid the shoulder bump, catch the elevator, and make a great wise-ass remark before the doors close!	Look, Newbie, if you go ahead and leave this hospital knowing only one thing and God save me, it looks like there's a real chance that might happen please let this be that one thing: I'm in charge, and I don't care about your opinion. Now go get me a cup of coffee.	Sounds to me like a G.I. bleed.	Yes. Yes, you are. Fortunately, though, your vitals are normal, so we'll check back with you in a little while.
Stop.	You're right, J.D. You are funny.	Have you ever noticed that words that rhyme with "bowel" are always bad? Like "scowl", "growl"..."movies with Andie MacDowell"....	Mm.
All right.It doesn't look like he's ischemic.	You know what, what the hell. It can't hurt. Let's get on it.	Look, Dr. Cox, I know my opinion doesn't mean anything and I'm always wrong and apparently useless which deep down you know isn't true because... ...shoot, I forgot your coffee. Anyway, I was thinking we should get a CT scan on Mr. Strauss, because he might have bowel ischemia.	You'd be surprised how when one thing goes right around here, everything seems to go right.
In the end, you learn to treasure the times when things go your way.	Rachel, clean up.	Of course, it still doesn't always work out the way you'd hope.	Clamp.
And be there for the ones you love when they don't.And most importantly, you learn to accept that some things are out of your hands.	So glad you're okay!	In the end, you learn to treasure the times when things go your way.	Rachel, clean up.
Yeah....	Didn't matter when we caught it, Newbie. It was just his time.	And be there for the ones you love when they don't.And most importantly, you learn to accept that some things are out of your hands.	So glad you're okay!
Fine.	More beads, dammit! Come on!	Enough beads! No more flashing.	Oooh.Come on!!!!
How else am I supposed to know?	You want my fiancée? Just go ahead and take her, 'cause she's been nagging the crap outta me. "Pick up your socks. Wash your dishes. Stop whispering 'booya' to J.D. in the morning after we have sex."	Latah!That means "I'll be seeing you later."	I gotta give Mr. Ingram his meds so, latah!
Ooooooh! That ass warrants the Batman sound effects loop!	I'm sayin'!	How else am I supposed to know?	You want my fiancée? Just go ahead and take her, 'cause she's been nagging the crap outta me. "Pick up your socks. Wash your dishes. Stop whispering 'booya' to J.D. in the morning after we have sex."
ZAP!	POW!	Ooooooh! That ass warrants the Batman sound effects loop!	I'm sayin'!
That means "now she all maaad."	Thanks for having my back.Babe.	Tushie parts?	Turk, how come every time I turn around you're checking out some woman's you-know-what?
Mine's firm, like mutton.	...Thank you...	Kudos on the nice pooper.	Hi!
Nooooo!	Steve took a year off to take care of his parents, and while he was gone, Sherry starting seeing Dr. Harding.	Damn you, Ron!	No, I didn't!
Oh, thank God!You know, 'cause they...they both died doing what they loved.... Rafting.	Yes!	Nooooo!	Sherry and Gary?
I'm sorry, what?	Sure! That sounds great!	And you just hate to see anyone get crushed. ...Even Dr. Hot Butt.	So what do you say?
Now I want you to go.	"Ron." Ron he's not just some guy, J.D. He's my "what if?" guy. The one I always wondered about, the one I idealized, you know?	"Ronnie"?	Look! Everyone thinks it's just guys who get all freaked out before the wedding, but it happens to women too!
Then you won't mind if I tell Turk!	Look, I would never do anything inappropriate.	That she's a sorceress!	Now I want you to go.
Damn beads....	If you have to, go ahead. But! Then I'll know that we're not as close as I thought!	Then you won't mind if I tell Turk!	Look, I would never do anything inappropriate.
...What you'd look like if you were Chinese...?	What were you thinking about?	Uncool!	Ooh! Lemon zinger!
Hoo! That was lucky!	Me too!	...What you'd look like if you were Chinese...?	What were you thinking about?
Turk, don't you have any work to do?	Nah, it's on hold. The director dropped out.	I hear they're coming out with a 'Stuart Little 3'.	Nag! Nag! Nag! Nag! You see how Carla is lately. I mean, is that all I have to look forward to?
Beads, keep me strong!	Dude. Surgeon.	Turk, don't you have any work to do?	Nah, it's on hold. The director dropped out.
Nothing.	What?	Beads, keep me strong!	Dude. Surgeon.
I don't know. People always said that in the movies.	Why would I scream?	Whatever you do, don't scream.	Whoooa!
Mm.	Really?	You know, for a minute there I actually thought you had a twin brother.	I guess you can never underestimate how the smallest gesture can make everything better.
Stop it.	Was it when my twin brother was here?	Mm.	Really?
Clever.	Things you say when you talk to your patients.	Noooo. They're the charts you wanted, plus! patient history charts from the last ten years, which yours truly stayed up all night organizing not only chronologically but by severity of condition.There's a good chance I'm gonna kill someone.	Are those the charts I wanted?
No, but wait!I already got my shifts covered for the next two days! Besides, where're you gonna find somebody else? You think Lonnie, my intern, gives a rat's ass about acute thomrobotic thrombocytopenic purpura?	Ah, don't bother with that, Trish. You know, I've been getting my hair cut by my barber, Big Frank, for seventeen years now. Is it because his prices remained the same? No. Is it because I like the way his man-breasts feel gently resting on my shoulders when he does my sideburns? A little, yes. But, mainly, it's because, unlike you, he does just exactly what I tell him to do. You see, it's my way or the highway, and since you've already broken that dictum you're out!	Clever.	Things you say when you talk to your patients.
Hey, Laverne. What'd you give me if I get this jelly bean into your cleavage?	I guess I could go home.... But there's plenty of important stuff I need to do around here.	Kiss ass.	It is gonna be so amazing working on the disease that tore my family apart.
Owwww.	Ah, ba da ba.	Ow!	I don't know, sir.
Well, Brad, I'm the type of clown that likes to wear tight pants.	Why're your pants so tight? Clowns have baggy pants!	Dr. Reid couldn't be here today, children, so I'm here in her place.	Kurt was the one that was always there for me. And at the end of the day, that's who you want the guy who shows up when you need him, without having to ask.
What other clown?	But the other clown has baggy pants!	Well, Brad, I'm the type of clown that likes to wear tight pants.	Why're your pants so tight? Clowns have baggy pants!
Janitor!	Hello, old friend.	What other clown?	But the other clown has baggy pants!
So you steal my research project and now you want me to do your dirty work?	Mr. Millican just died, and his family needs to be notified. Since I'm still kind of new at this, I was hoping you could do it.	Okay, let's take a little break, kids. Duck, Duck, Eel.	Dr. Dorian?
Oh, just breaking some bad news...circus style.	J.D., what are you doing?	Unfortunately your grandfather's bowel burst, causing a severe sepsis. We were unable to save him. I'm so sorry.Again, I'm...I'm very sorry.	You're just upset because it's never easy to give someone bad news.
The clasp! The clasp!	What?	I can't find the clasp.	What the hell is she doing? It's The Judge!Oh.
Naughty!	I switched to frontsies!	The clasp! The clasp!	What?
We only had two.	Position One, Two, or Three?	Naughty!	I switched to frontsies!
It's a mystery how one woman can drive you crazy over and over again.While another can bring you right back down to earth.In the end, you have to trust that the perfect woman will always lead you in the right direction.	Oh, yeah. Well, I have something to show you later.	We only had two.	Position One, Two, or Three?
Look, Elliot, I don't want to jinx this, but, how did that just happen?	So did you ever get the guts to mail the invitations?	It's a mystery how one woman can drive you crazy over and over again.While another can bring you right back down to earth.In the end, you have to trust that the perfect woman will always lead you in the right direction.	Oh, yeah. Well, I have something to show you later.
Sean?	You were a clown for me. You were there when I needed you without me even having to ask.	Look, Elliot, I don't want to jinx this, but, how did that just happen?	So did you ever get the guts to mail the invitations?
About ninety seconds.	How soon after you guys hooked up?	You be.She's already back with Sean.	Dude, ignore her. That's three years in a row who's feeling you?
What should I do?	Oooooh.	About ninety seconds.	How soon after you guys hooked up?
Danni!?	Irv didn't look great, but I didn't have time to talk.	Ehp-ehp-ehp! You look great, Irv!	I've been trying like the dickens to cut down on my snacking, but it's just so
When you run into someone you used to date, either you find them totally annoying or enough time has passed that you've idealized everything about them.	Danni!?	Irv didn't look great, but I didn't have time to talk.	Ehp-ehp-ehp! You look great, Irv!
"Hey, Jay-Dee!"	Hey, J.D.	When you run into someone you used to date, either you find them totally annoying or enough time has passed that you've idealized everything about them.	Danni!?
Oh, be nice.	Oh, okay. I'll see you later.	I'm actually on my way to see somebody, so, you know....	"Hey, Jay-Dee!"
Ooh! Gotta go!	Well, actually, I	Danni, wait!How've you been?	Oh, be nice.
Hey, Elliot.	And there she was my lady.	Ooh! Gotta go!	Well, actually, I
Should we just hold each other?	J.D., I can't talk right now.	Hey, Elliot.	And there she was my lady.
What's up....Attention, Sacred Heart! Everyone please gather 'round. Doctors, nurses, patients, hear ye, hear ye.Everyone should know that last night, Elliot Reid and I made passionate love for a good hour and a half. Check that! A _great_ hour and a half.When I hit it, I hit it good! That is all!	Sorry! Sorry! I couldn't find a parking spot! Heh.Hey, J.D. What's up?	Should we just hold each other?	J.D., I can't talk right now.
I know. I mean, you don't want to be rusty at sex before you throw down with your real boyfriend, do ya?	Listen, J.D.... Last night was really important to me.	Peace out, Sean.	Bye, J.D.
I totally understand. You know, Danni and I are getting back together, too.	Look, you and I have been down this road before and we both know where it ends.	I know. I mean, you don't want to be rusty at sex before you throw down with your real boyfriend, do ya?	Listen, J.D.... Last night was really important to me.
Damn! I should know this!	Danni? Danni, Danni, Danni.... What was her last name?	We are?	I totally understand. You know, Danni and I are getting back together, too.
Yes! Raspy voice!	Blonde hair!	Damn! I should know this!	Danni? Danni, Danni, Danni.... What was her last name?
Oh, my God, Danni, I am so sorry. I thought that's what you wanted.	GIVE IT TO ME!	Oh, I don't know, Danni. The real me's not really into that.	Yeah, but back then I was pretending to be someone I thought you wanted me to be, and that didn't work. So now.......I'm gonna let the real me come out. And the real me wants to do it again...and she wants to do it rough!
YAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!	It was.	Oh, my God, Danni, I am so sorry. I thought that's what you wanted.	GIVE IT TO ME!
I hate my girlfriend.	In life, there are personal realizations....	Barbara's my mom.	Man, I get so gassy after having sex.Oh, by the way, some skank named Barbara called, and I told her to back off.
....and professional ones.	I hate my girlfriend.	In life, there are personal realizations....	Barbara's my mom.
But the worst are the realizations that sneak up on you.	Listen, Serpico, I go four steps out that door to my car every day. And that's important, because if I don't beat Enid home from her thighs & buns class, I have to help her peel off her leotard. So remember this: I hired you, and I can fire you.	....and professional ones.	I hate my girlfriend.
Last night in bed, I knocked you unconscious!	Not really. I'm more into tough guys, you know?	"Enjoy" is such a strong word.... I...I'm used to it. You know, like cafeteria food, or the constant threat of terrorism.	Do you even enjoy spending time with me?
So I guess...this is over.	For like _five seconds_!	Last night in bed, I knocked you unconscious!	Not really. I'm more into tough guys, you know?
So, you'd rather hang out with someone you don't even like than be alone?	Why?	So I guess...this is over.	For like _five seconds_!
Yeah, me too. I mean, come on, how many couples out there actually have fun together?	Yeah, pretty much.	So, you'd rather hang out with someone you don't even like than be alone?	Why?
Ohh, I don't know! Come over my house, sleep with me, and then dump me the minute Sean shows up so I feel like a complete loser!	Do...what?	Okay, sort away, Seany-Sean-Sean!Oh, my God!How could you do this to me?	We're both good-looking guys, am I right? We'll sort this out when I get back!
You know I only have one set.	Oh, you seem real crushed! I mean, you jumped into bed with Danni so quick you didn't have time to change the sheets!	Ohh, I don't know! Come over my house, sleep with me, and then dump me the minute Sean shows up so I feel like a complete loser!	Do...what?
Could I ask you one?	Look, J.D., can I ask you a favor?	You know I only have one set.	Oh, you seem real crushed! I mean, you jumped into bed with Danni so quick you didn't have time to change the sheets!
Damn, I don't have one.	Sure, anything. What is it?	Could I ask you one?	Look, J.D., can I ask you a favor?
Look, Elliot! What do you want!?	Didn't have one, did ya?	Damn, I don't have one.	Sure, anything. What is it?
Good.	Hey, J.D. Can I talk to you for a sec?Look, things have been a little weird between Elliot and I since I got back.	I was so mad at Elliot I couldn't sleep last night. Also, Danni snores like a gutted wild boar. But mostly it was the Elliot thing.	Oh. Here's your chance!
Sorry, everybody. False alarm.	J.D., listen. Did anything happen between you and Elliot while I was gone?	Good.	Hey, J.D. Can I talk to you for a sec?Look, things have been a little weird between Elliot and I since I got back.
Or whether it's a personal choice.	Come on! What are you gonna do about it?	There comes a time when every man has to make a choice. Whether it's a professional choice...	Well?
In the end, it's about integrity.	Hey. Wanna go for a beer after the show?	Or whether it's a personal choice.	Come on! What are you gonna do about it?
Even if that means showing you both care a little.	Here's your beer.	And it's about chasing after what you really want.	No!
When it comes down to it, you just have to be proud of the decision you make.	Giddyup, Dr. Dorkian!	Even if it means sacrificing your own happiness.	Hey.
Nobody cares, Danni.	You know what I was thinking?	Me, I was stuck at a couples-only dinner party. There were the soon-to-be newlyweds....There were the girl that I loved and the guy trying to eat her face....And then there's Danni....	Did that just happen? Anybody?
I guess.	You wanna have sex?	Guess it's just the two of us.	Baby, not now. Don't know yet!
Please don't.	Do I have to look at you?	I guess.	You wanna have sex?
Danni!	Kelso!	Turk!	Oh, Danni!
Because she hears like a bat.	That is weird. Why are we whispering?	Keep it.Dude, Danni did the weirdest thing last night she called out her own name during sex.	I'm gonna go put some clothes on. After all, I am a lady.Oh, by the way, I used your razor to shave my pits.
Yeah, 'cause they can't see.	Bats hear really well?	Because she hears like a bat.	That is weird. Why are we whispering?
No, no, no, no, no. Bats and whales, bats and whales!	Oh, yeah, that's right, sonar. Wait a second, that's whales!	Yeah, 'cause they can't see.	Bats hear really well?
Anyway, I have to break up with her.	Okay, okay, okay.	No, no, no, no, no. Bats and whales, bats and whales!	Oh, yeah, that's right, sonar. Wait a second, that's whales!
Danni, I'm not sure how to do this but, uh...I just don't think we should see each other anymore.	Okay, just let her down easy.	Anyway, I have to break up with her.	Okay, okay, okay.
See, like a bat, dude! Like a bat!	No, I don't!	You know what! I don't even care, you know why? Because I bet she's calling out my name while she's sleeping with him!	Whoa! I guess she wasn't calling out her own name after all!
Aaaaaaaaagh!	Check.	See, like a bat, dude! Like a bat!	No, I don't!
That's not true, is it?	Hey, J.D., don't come chasing after me like you do with Elliot. Because if there's one thing everyone knows about John Dorian, it's that he always wants what he can't have.	Mmm.	Crunchberry, wrong pipe.
I don't know. Remember back in college, when we had tickets to see Michael Jordan in the playoffs?	That's not true. Okay, you really need to stop saying that. The point is, I don't lose my cool.	His dad loved doughnuts.	Duncan?
Hey, was I supposed to bring the tickets or the sandwiches?Oh, God.	We're goin' to see Michael Jordan! We're goin' to see Michael Jordan! We're goin' to see Michael Jordan! 'Cause we got good tickets! We went five hundred miles	I don't know. Remember back in college, when we had tickets to see Michael Jordan in the playoffs?	That's not true. Okay, you really need to stop saying that. The point is, I don't lose my cool.
You shaved your head for the first time after that.	OH! NO! Leave it on the floor! You leave it on the floor!	Hey, was I supposed to bring the tickets or the sandwiches?Oh, God.	We're goin' to see Michael Jordan! We're goin' to see Michael Jordan! We're goin' to see Michael Jordan! 'Cause we got good tickets! We went five hundred miles
Why are you here? Hospitals don't sell cigarettes!	Wanting what you can't have.	You shaved your head for the first time after that.	OH! NO! Leave it on the floor! You leave it on the floor!
Quiet time, Todd.	Man, I'd smoke her.	Why are you here? Hospitals don't sell cigarettes!	Wanting what you can't have.
You know, I I don't even care what you think.	Why don't you just let her be happy with...stunningly handsome, full-lipped guy.	Mmm.	Dr. Ross, and Rachel from Bookkeeping.
And just like that I saw my window.	Yeah.... It's a little scary.	So, moving in together, huh?	My mommy said you had lollipops. Gimme a red one!
Oh, no, he killed her.	They broke up?	It _is_ scary! You know, I knew this girl in college who moved in with her boyfriend? Everything changed stopped talking to each other, started fighting all the time and...you know the rest.	And just like that I saw my window.
Could be you!	Dr. Reid? They need you to check on that stabbing victim in Room 301?	Oh, no, he killed her.	They broke up?
Nothing.	What?	Could be you!	Dr. Reid? They need you to check on that stabbing victim in Room 301?
Why are you here, Sean?	Don't do that.	Nothing.	What?
'Little House on the Prairie.'	What are we watching?	Elliot? What are you doing?	I guess the funny thing about love is you never know how things are gonna work out.Like me. I lost Elliot. But at least I went down swinging.
Well, I think you made the right choice.	J.D., it's just so weird. I mean, my whole future was right there in front of me, and I just walked away. All because of you.	As for me, all I needed was Elliot.	I love _you_!
Oh, my God! I DON'T WANT HER!	Well, Dr. Dorian, you have me. You finally have me.	I think that the problem with most people who want what they can't have is that, when they actually get the thing they covet, they don't want it anymore. But not this guy.	Well, I think you made the right choice.
Okay, not him.	Yeah?	I knew I needed to talk this over with someone who understood me. Someone I had recently been intimate with.	Wow.
He's not a celebrity!	I don't know. I thought it'd be cool to date a celebrity.	Please, Larry!What the hell you doing with that guy?	I think I'll go put on some underwear.
Are you the Soup Nazi from 'Seinfeld'?	Wait a second!	He's not a celebrity!	I don't know. I thought it'd be cool to date a celebrity.
Say the soup thing.	No.	Are you the Soup Nazi from 'Seinfeld'?	Wait a second!
Dammit!	No!	Say the soup thing.	No.
Why would I idealize women?	Well maybe it's 'cause you idealize women and no one can live up to your standards.	Look, Danni, the reason I'm here is well, first of all I wanted to give you back your skull lighter.Secondly, you always seem to have some insight in to why I'm so messed up. I mean here I-I chase after Elliot for three years, now I don't want her!	Hey, Marco! The invites said no dates!No da ....
I love you, honey. You're the smartest, handsomest, sweetest boy in the whole world. And no matter how hard you look, you will never find a woman who'll love you as much as I do.	What's your mom like?	Why would I idealize women?	Well maybe it's 'cause you idealize women and no one can live up to your standards.
My mom is perfect.	I know, Mommy.	I love you, honey. You're the smartest, handsomest, sweetest boy in the whole world. And no matter how hard you look, you will never find a woman who'll love you as much as I do.	What's your mom like?
Hm?	Look, kid, you're just confused. All you need to do is focus on the little things you love about her. Like...the way she puts out a cigarette...or how when she finishes a beer, she looks inside the can just to check if there's any left.	My mom is perfect.	I know, Mommy.
It's 5 to 9?! I gotta go!	Sweetie, it's 5 to 9, and my Denver omelet's not gonna make itself.	Hm?	Look, kid, you're just confused. All you need to do is focus on the little things you love about her. Like...the way she puts out a cigarette...or how when she finishes a beer, she looks inside the can just to check if there's any left.
What is it again? It's like, you're out of luck in the soup department?	Oh, he is so the Soup Nazi! Trick him!	It's 5 to 9?! I gotta go!	Sweetie, it's 5 to 9, and my Denver omelet's not gonna make itself.
Ha! Rad.Oooog! Ow!	NO SOUP FOR YOU!	What is it again? It's like, you're out of luck in the soup department?	Oh, he is so the Soup Nazi! Trick him!
Just lying here, watching you sleep.	What are you doing?	Ha! Rad.Oooog! Ow!	NO SOUP FOR YOU!
Morning!	The arrival of the janitors!	Then Elliot and I got to witness an event that many had spoken of, but none had ever seen.	Fine, so it's not the self-esteem thing.
No, I was I was kidding.	Is it? Is it really?	Morning!	The arrival of the janitors!
Who won?	I'd stay out of his way today. He just lost the election for union president.	No, I was I was kidding.	Is it? Is it really?
And I have uncontrollable hostility towards small rodents.	Hey, let's rent 'Kangaroo Jack' tonight!	Maybe Elliot's just not the right fit for me. I mean, I'm the kinda guy who likes stupid movies.	Oh! Cool!
Dammit, she's perfect on paper! What the hell's wrong with me?	Or we could just go shoot rats at the dump!	And I have uncontrollable hostility towards small rodents.	Hey, let's rent 'Kangaroo Jack' tonight!
I guess the Soup Nazi was right, it is the little things that are important.Or how she's the only person I know who sneezes with her eyes open.	Nothing. I just love the way you drift off in your head sometimes.	What?	Dammit, she's perfect on paper! What the hell's wrong with me?
And that's when I realized that I really liked all those things about Elliot, but I didn't love them...and I didn't love her.	Atchoo. Ahem. 'Scuse me.	I guess the Soup Nazi was right, it is the little things that are important.Or how she's the only person I know who sneezes with her eyes open.	Nothing. I just love the way you drift off in your head sometimes.
Oh, boy.	You're the best.See you later.	And that's when I realized that I really liked all those things about Elliot, but I didn't love them...and I didn't love her.	Atchoo. Ahem. 'Scuse me.
So now that you're gettin' married, it's all about you.	Dude, I would love to help right now, but I'm in the middle of writing my vows. And all I've got so far is, "Let's give it up for the caterers! WOO! Good chicken!"	How does everybody know about this?You're a very loud chewer.	Why, did you sleep with her again?
And now we live together.	Oh, it's not problem. See ya, roomie.	Hey, Elliot. Thanks for letting me crash at your place while Carla's family's in town for the wedding.	Oh. All right.
Aaagh!	Sheila!	What the?	And now we live together.

Boyfriend?	God, we have so much history together. So great to finally be able to call you my boyfriend.	Yeah.	Oh, yeah....He could run like the wind, but his tail couldn't put out that fire.
No it's just...it's nice to hear it out loud.	Oh, should I not have said that?	Boyfriend?	God, we have so much history together. So great to finally be able to call you my boyfriend.
Yeah, it is.	There. It's perfect.	And it was nice. I mean, here I was having my tie tied by this beautiful woman who happened to be one of my closest friends, and I realized that this is what a relationship is supposed to feel like.	No it's just...it's nice to hear it out loud.
Turk!	Carla, I love that you get cold when it's seventy-one degrees out. I love that it takes you an hour and a half to order a sandwich.I love that you get a little crinkle above your nose when you're looking at me like I'm nuts. Yeah, like you got right now! Just like that one! I love that you're the last person I want to talk to before I go to sleep at night.	Wow. That's a hard act to follow.	I've made a lot of mistakes in my life, but you've managed to erase them all, because each and every one of them has led me to you.
Gimme some champagne! I need a victory sip!	Ohhhh-ho!	Oh, you know what? If it's okay with you, I'm gonna go ahead and take relationship advice from someone whose fiancee is currently speaking to him. Ohhhh!	That's great, dude. I know you think you're being nice, but I'm pretty sure Elliot doesn't want to spend her life with someone who doesn't love her.
Come on, man. Elliot and I are like best friends. We love hanging out with each other. Maybe that's love. I mean, who who knows what love really is?	Cheers.You're making a big mistake.	Gimme some champagne! I need a victory sip!	Ohhhh-ho!
I hope so.	I do. J.D., when I look at Carla, I see the future. I see kids, I see minivans, I see a beer gut on me, of course, not her.	Come on, man. Elliot and I are like best friends. We love hanging out with each other. Maybe that's love. I mean, who who knows what love really is?	Cheers.You're making a big mistake.
Turk.	But you know what's really weird? None of that stuff scares me. Not even when	I hope so.	I do. J.D., when I look at Carla, I see the future. I see kids, I see minivans, I see a beer gut on me, of course, not her.
I know. Maybe you should stand up and say that.	Dude, I'm trying to make a point here.	Turk.	But you know what's really weird? None of that stuff scares me. Not even when
Listening to Turk made me think a lot about love.Like how sometimes it can be hard to understand.	Carla.When I look into your eyes, I see the future. I see kids, I see minivans...you name it, I see it. The weird thing is, though, as long as I see your smile, none of that stuff scares me.	I know. Maybe you should stand up and say that.	Dude, I'm trying to make a point here.
Please don't cry.	What?	I don't love you.	Aren't they amazing?
Elliot, maybe you should pay attention to what you're doing.	Uh, help this.	That looks like fun. Can I help?	"I do." And then it's classy kiss....Or sexy kiss....Or slutty kiss....
Turk and I have to go.	Oh, really?Uhmm.... How how thin did you want those?	Elliot, maybe you should pay attention to what you're doing.	Uh, help this.
Look out, Tiger!	See, Turk and I had made a pact.The day that one of us got married, we'd play a last round of tennis-ball golf in the parking lot as single best friends.	Turk and I have to go.	Oh, really?Uhmm.... How how thin did you want those?
Hell yeah.	That'll play.	Look out, Tiger!	See, Turk and I had made a pact.The day that one of us got married, we'd play a last round of tennis-ball golf in the parking lot as single best friends.
He'll be fine.I can't believe you're actually gettin' married.	Huh?	Oh, yeah, and the guy getting married has to caddie for the other guy naked.	Hell yeah.
Hey, where's the fuzzy cover for my one-wood?	Me neither, buddy.	He'll be fine.I can't believe you're actually gettin' married.	Huh?
Aw, dude! My mom made that!Still, I'm happy for you, man.	It's on my nine-wood.	Hey, where's the fuzzy cover for my one-wood?	Me neither, buddy.
Mmm.	Oh, thanks.	Ooh, nice use of "finagle."	If I work this shift, I can finagle two extra days on the honeymoon.
Danni, what are you doing here?	For some reason, this woman wants you to usher her.	Holla.	Hey, J.Z.
You can't just crash my best friend's wedding!	We RSVP'd when we were still dating.	Danni, what are you doing here?	For some reason, this woman wants you to usher her.

Well, that's gonna be tough on a Saturday, with Eyebrows Eyebrows Eyebrows being closed. They're gonna have to go all the way across town to the Eyebrow Hut.Look, Elliot, just tell me what you want me to do and I'll do it.	They're out buying an eyebrow.	Where're the other bridesmaids?	Hello?
I didn't steal Elliot from you, man! She just panicked 'cause you guys were moving in together!	What do you want, J.D.?	Ah.	I'm a quarter Hungarian.
Sean, if you have any guts at all, you will show up at this wedding, take her into your...hairy arms, and tell her you want her back!You should...probably shower first.	I don't know, J.D....	I didn't steal Elliot from you, man! She just panicked 'cause you guys were moving in together!	What do you want, J.D.?
I would, too.	A little.	Do you ever miss the ladies?	Miss Espinosa, if your fiancé is not here in the next thirty seconds, I'm gonna have to pull the plug.
I'm I'm just trying to think of ways to make things right!	Ow! What are you doing?!	Elliot, check it out. Kelso gave me his car keys.	There she is! Do something charming.
You wore your janitor uniform to a wedding?	How's it goin'?	Keep walking, dragon.Yagh!	Happy wedding, nerd.
Who's that?	No, I wasn't invited to the wedding. I just work here on weekends.	You wore your janitor uniform to a wedding?	How's it goin'?
Are forks where the big money is?	My date.Forks! Frannie! Forks! Forks!	Who's that?	No, I wasn't invited to the wedding. I just work here on weekends.
Remember that after-party we had in college, when the stereo went out and I ended up hooking up with that grad student from Brazil?	Okay, Carla's dying, it's rally time. We have no band, we have no DJ. You're my best man brainstorm.	I know. I know.	I shouldn't be drinking.
That was awesome.	Yeah?	Remember that after-party we had in college, when the stereo went out and I ended up hooking up with that grad student from Brazil?	Okay, Carla's dying, it's rally time. We have no band, we have no DJ. You're my best man brainstorm.
I thought she was kneeling.Ted! Can you play a little music for us, buddy?	Woo hoo, you made out with a little person.	That was awesome.	Yeah?
You and I are gonna be okay, right?	J.D.! It's not happening. Besides, if Sean and I are meant to be together, I never would have gone home with you that night and sabotaged everything that I had with him.	You can't let him drive her home! She says "thank you" the naughty way!	Uh, well...sure.Oh! Okay!
Probably not.Elliot!You let me know when we are.	What do you think?	You and I are gonna be okay, right?	J.D.! It's not happening. Besides, if Sean and I are meant to be together, I never would have gone home with you that night and sabotaged everything that I had with him.
Thanks for helping out.	One, two, three.	Other times, well, you've kind of sealed your own fate.Either way, you have to trust that whatever's supposed to happen, will happen.Besides, somehow you always seem to end up with the person you're meant to be with.	Mm-hmm.
We still had some work to do.Where was I? Oh, yeah. The hospital also had a new attending psychologist.Dr...Molly...Clock.	Hey, buddy. What's with the giant needle?	A lot's been going on around here the last two weeks. Turk and Carla got married, that short guy hurt his hand....And since I totally broke Elliot's heart, I was still trying to smooth things over.	All right, thank you.Aaaahhhh.
But I also heard she was a little spacy.	Mr. Witcomb is in the middle of a psychotic break from self-discontinuation of his meds, so we need to get him on Haloperidol IV stat.	Not only was Dr. Clock easy on the eyes, but apparently she was an excellent shrink.	I'm I'm kind of a favorite around here!
Um...we weren't talking.	So where were we?	But I also heard she was a little spacy.	Mr. Witcomb is in the middle of a psychotic break from self-discontinuation of his meds, so we need to get him on Haloperidol IV stat.
No, I mean like we've never talked...ever.	Was it 'cause of something you did, 'cause I am totally over it. I don't even remember what it was.	Um...we weren't talking.	So where were we?
You don't.	Well how do I know your name, then?	No, I mean like we've never talked...ever.	Was it 'cause of something you did, 'cause I am totally over it. I don't even remember what it was.
It's Johnny.	You're freakin' me out, Jimmy!	You don't.	Well how do I know your name, then?
Dammit! Dammit! Dammit!	Now I'm gonna commit it to my memory forever.Johnny.... Johnny.... Johnny....	Why would you say "Johnny"? You hate "Johnny"!	It's Johnny.
Dammit!	Okay, Johnny	Dammit! Dammit! Dammit!	Now I'm gonna commit it to my memory forever.Johnny.... Johnny.... Johnny....
So let's talk! It's not like I'm going anywhere, right?	I'm sorry, I'm just meeting so many people, and everyone's kind of cliquish and I haven't really gotten to know anybody.	Dammit!	Okay, Johnny
'Scuse me.Turk's back from his honeymoon!	Great! Oh, thanks. Okay	So let's talk! It's not like I'm going anywhere, right?	I'm sorry, I'm just meeting so many people, and everyone's kind of cliquish and I haven't really gotten to know anybody.

Now what you hear is not a dream, so listen up, you nappy head! Yo, hear my rhyme, it's wake-up time, so get your white ass outta bed!

Come on, man, it's our last week together! The J.D. and Cox train is pulling into the station. You must have a metaphor you want to use; hit me with it!	That depends, does "blalalala" mean confused and incredibly annoyed?	Sooo, ya felling all, like, blalala!	Yes, milady?

Driving, mostly.	Of what?	Ah, Malik. Lots of memories in that old car.	Hey, Triple A? Look, I need a pick-up on the corner of Fourth andYou know what? You'll see it.
Carla let Turk make a decision!	I'll tell you what, Turk. Why don't you go pick out our car.	And then the most amazing thing happened.	Baby, a Mini Cooper?

Mmm.	Drink your juice, Mr. Blass.Mr. Blass has Pick's disease, which is similar to presentation to multi-infarct dementia.	Haunting.	"And I would do anything for love, but I won't do that. No, I won't do that."
Okay, you gotta take a stand on this "Johnny" thing before it becomes permanent.	Anyhoo, he likes to sing when he gets up in the morning, and the weird thing is, Johnny, he actually captures the mood of the room.	Mmm.	Drink your juice, Mr. Blass.Mr. Blass has Pick's disease, which is similar to presentation to multi-infarct dementia.
What's wrong with you?	You know what, it's "J.D." for "John Dorian," so so John...look, you know what, Johnny's fine, it's cool.	Okay, you gotta take a stand on this "Johnny" thing before it becomes permanent.	Anyhoo, he likes to sing when he gets up in the morning, and the weird thing is, Johnny, he actually captures the mood of the room.
What floor?	Anyway, Johnny, I was noticing that you were having some trouble motivating your patient back in there, and I actually published a paper on motivation methodology in post-operative seniors, so, if you want, I could help.	What's wrong with you?	You know what, it's "J.D." for "John Dorian," so so John...look, you know what, Johnny's fine, it's cool.
You know, Molly, I appreciate the offer, but there's a very special doctor I use around here when I need help, and he'd be pretty pissed if I didn't come to him first.	Oh, my god, we're on an elevator.	What floor?	Anyway, Johnny, I was noticing that you were having some trouble motivating your patient back in there, and I actually published a paper on motivation methodology in post-operative seniors, so, if you want, I could help.
Please, you know you love it. Now, come on, one more time for nostalgia's sake: You come see my patient, you teach me a lesson, and then the music plays, right? In my head, it sounds like this: Ba-buh-buh-ba-buh-buh-buh, ba-buh-buh-ba-buh-buh-buh-buhhh.	Why, Mariska? Why do you insist on bothering _me_ with these things?	You know, Molly, I appreciate the offer, but there's a very special doctor I use around here when I need help, and he'd be pretty pissed if I didn't come to him first.	Oh, my god, we're on an elevator.
What the hell was that?	Okay, then. I sure hope you're comfortable in that bed, because you're gonna be in one just like it for the rest of your natural born life.	Here comes the magic. He always gives me goosebumps.	I just don't have it in me.
I agrizzle, my nizzle.	Do you want me to give you my "things I don't care about" speech again? Because, you know, I've updated it to include all white guys who add -izzle to anything.	Dr. Cox.I just want you to know I'm not ready to give up on Mr. Radford.	Goodnight, Giselle.
What can I say, it's been...horrifying.	Sounds like fun, but no. Our game is over, buddy. Your residency's coming to a close and...that's it, nothing left to do but:	Well then I'm sure I can expect an appropriate retaliatory response. Maybe you could shoot me in the neck.	You know, I know you knocked that exit sign down.
Well, this is kinda cool! Hey, you know, maybe we could, like, be friends.	Thank you!	What can I say, it's been...horrifying.	Sounds like fun, but no. Our game is over, buddy. Your residency's coming to a close and...that's it, nothing left to do but:
I'd never tried it.	You like huntin' squirrels?	Well, this is kinda cool! Hey, you know, maybe we could, like, be friends.	Thank you!
And the day just got better from there.Mostly because Mr. Radford had the same "screw you, Dr. Cox" attitude that I had.	Easiest thing in the world all you need are some walnuts...and a boxing glove!	I'd never tried it.	You like huntin' squirrels?
Actually, no, I almost drowned diving for a nickel; but I'm sure you're more interested in conspiracy theories about gangs and friend stealing. Peace out.	So, what, are they shooting some sort of Geeks of Sacred Heart calendar out here?	Okay, but stand back. These things can be pretty dangerous!Whoa. Oh, boy. Whooooaaaa! Agghhh!Aaaaggglghlgggh! Aggghhh!	Excuse me, doctor. I dropped a nickel in that therapy whirlpool. You think you could get it for me?
Hmm, no.	Look, isn't it possible that Dr. Cox tricked you as a motivational ploy?	I must go to one of those.	Johnny, I mean what Dr. Cox did was classic reverse psychology. And so is this: Behavioral modification can sometimes be brought about through classic conditioning.Reverse psychology? Nothing? 'Cause that really kills at the psychiatric conferences.
Nnoo! You're like a crazy person!	After he said there was no hope with Mr. Radford, didn't you both work harder?	Hmm, no.	Look, isn't it possible that Dr. Cox tricked you as a motivational ploy?
Uh, excuse me, I'm not a child. I'm a doctor.	Look, I'll tell you something else. I mean, Dr. Cox is a text-book closed-off alpha male. I mean, you can try forever, but you're never gonna get that hug that you really want.	Nnoo! You're like a crazy person!	After he said there was no hope with Mr. Radford, didn't you both work harder?
Oh, my God, it's finally happening! Don't miss a moment! Take it all in! Ba-buh-ba-buh-buh-buhh, buh-ba-ba-ba-ba-buh-buhhh	Well, nubile one, your last lesson and you didn't even need it.Three years and it's finally over. I know what you want, I do.Come here.	Yes. And I figured it out all by myself, without anyone helping me or explaining it directly in my face or anything.	You do, do you?
Whether or not you survive in a hospital is all about how you handle your relationships.	Good God, Fantasia. You you don't actually think I'm done teaching you, do you? D'you not understand the only difference between today and tomorrow is that you wake up tomorrow and start coming in here and killing people, that no one can say, "It's no big deal, he's just a resident." Instead, what they're damn sure gonna be wondering is who tried to educate your sorry ass. And when that finger of blame starts pointing in my direction, I had damn sure better be in a coma from the anger stroke I suffered from the last time you tried to hug me.Oh, and, uh, don't be late tomorrow...Doctor.	Ow.	Oh, my God, it's finally happening! Don't miss a moment! Take it all in! Ba-buh-ba-buh-buh-buhh, buh-ba-ba-ba-ba-buh-buhhh

Hooogh! Aaaaaaaaaaauuuugggghhh!Oof.	Ba-buh-buh-buh-ba-buh-buh-buhhh. Buh-buh-buh-buh-ba	As for me, it was my relationships that got me through my residency.	Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
We're not done with our thing yet, are we.	Bull's eye!	Hooogh! Aaaaaaaaaaauuuugggghhh!Oof.	Ba-buh-buh-buh-ba-buh-buh-buhhh. Buh-buh-buh-buh-ba
The weird thing is, he was right.	No. For you, it's all just beginning.	We're not done with our thing yet, are we.	Bull's eye!
It wasn't all bad.Bubble wrap! Bubble wrap! Bubble wrap!	Hold up. They made you move furniture?	Well, we didn't come straight here.Come on, Dorian. You gotta want it!	So lemme get this straight: You crashed in to their truck, and they just drive you to work?
Dr. Molly Clock, the new attending psychiatrist. Yes, she was HOHHHT! But I wasn't a fan. For one thing, she's always calling me "Johnny." Also, she wasn't very nice.	Yeah! Bubble wrap!	It wasn't all bad.Bubble wrap! Bubble wrap! Bubble wrap!	Hold up. They made you move furniture?
What. A. Bitch. Plus, she's _always_ with Elliot; and since I dumped her, we weren't getting along all that great.	Hey, sit with us. We'll make room, even if I have to stand.	Dr. Molly Clock, the new attending psychiatrist. Yes, she was HOHHHT! But I wasn't a fan. For one thing, she's always calling me "Johnny." Also, she wasn't very nice.	Yeah! Bubble wrap!
What? How does he know that?	Tough break, J.D. You've dreamed of being chief resident ever since you were a little boy growing up in Trotwood, Ohio.	I just needed to talk to someone.	You okay, buddy?
Please, sir, I totally get that.	Yes, genius, in this metaphor the hospital is a chicken.	Sir?	He donated a wing, a thigh, and a breast.
What a jerk!	Focus on nothing else.	How could a hospital be a chicken?	Please, sir, I totally get that.
Let me know how to get back on top. I'll do anything, even if it means I have to kill somebody!	Well, Jo-Jo, right now she's winning.	I am a medical professional, and you are not gonna get me to compete with Elliot.	Top-notch work, there, Barbie! She's good! She's very, very, _very_ good!
Oh, I'll impress you!Hit the water!	Well, you could start by getting the lightbulb out of this genius's pooper. Impress me.	Let me know how to get back on top. I'll do anything, even if it means I have to kill somebody!	Well, Jo-Jo, right now she's winning.
Doug! Stay positive.	I'll impress him some other way.	Oh, I'll impress you!Hit the water!	Well, you could start by getting the lightbulb out of this genius's pooper. Impress me.
Very funny!	Barbie. You're chief resident.	It's 3 o'clock! 3 o'clock's when you announce new chief resident, so we thought you might want	What?
Uh, what now?	Yeah, Scarlett? You're chief resident too.	No, no. I totally understand. Come on, you did what you had to do. You went with your gut; Elliot's a great doctor. I do have three questions, though: Why do you hate me when I show you nothing but love? Who's gonna tell my mom? And what the hell am I supposed to do with ten thousand "John Dorian, Chief Resident" business cards!?!?!	Keep it together. It's be a man time.
Wait, so, if we're both gonna be chief residents, why didn't you just say that from the beginning?	Well, I figure with her being ridiculously book-smart to the point where she has almost no interpersonal skills, and you being warm and cuddly as an un-potty trained labradoodle and about as useful in high-stress medical situations as an un-potty trained labradoodle _together_ the two of you make one barely passable doctor...slash labradoodle.	Uh, what now?	Yeah, Scarlett? You're chief resident too.
John Dorian, chief resident.It's just that Elliot and I doing this together is gonna be a little tough we're going through a bit of a rough patch.	What, and miss your hall of fame hissy? Not on your life.	Wait, so, if we're both gonna be chief residents, why didn't you just say that from the beginning?

Owwww!	Cleaning time!Don't worry, I'll go fast.	I guess the only thing to do when you're in the middle of it is to hope that nothing makes it worse.	Really.
It burns!	Whoop, that one got away.	Owwww!	Cleaning time!Don't worry, I'll go fast.
Of course not.	Johnny!	Great. Maybe we could make it permanent.	Don't worry, Johnny. Everyone's gonna be anonymous, I'm only using initials. You'll be "J.D."
We decided to go petty.	The way I see it, you guys can either get past it and talk like adults, or you can behave like petty children.	Of course not.	Johnny!
I'll take Doug.	Okay, instead of sharing you all, we're gonna separate you into two resident teams so that J.D. and I never have to see each other.	We decided to go petty.	The way I see it, you guys can either get past it and talk like adults, or you can behave like petty children.
Relax, Doug, you're the only one whose name I know.	YES! Suck on that!Thanks, J.D. First pick.	I'll take Doug.	Okay, instead of sharing you all, we're gonna separate you into two resident teams so that J.D. and I never have to see each other.
John Dorian, chief resident. Website's on the back.	Yeah, uh, name's Amy, actually.	Shut up, Doug!	Pick the hot chick.
Elliot and I weren't the only ones who decided to go petty.	Hey! I got like a two-hour break between patients, do you wanna grab lunch? Or dinner, I'm not really sure what time it is.	John Dorian, chief resident. Website's on the back.	Yeah, uh, name's Amy, actually.
Now, come on, you nerds!	Watch your ass.	Okay, she's gone.Now, I've heard some rumors there's been some fraternizing with some of Dr. Reid's residents. Now, I don't want to mention any names...but, Slobodan, enough of that crap!	Keep up, people! We got pre-rounds to do!
Do whatever you want, just don't come over to my area.	Don't worry, I just came to check on my patients.	Unbelievable, Doug.	Doug wanted me to give this patient five hundred thousand milligrams of Morphine. I thought I'd check with you before I killed a man.
Well, I wouldn't pay you.	You couldn't pay me to come over to your area.	Do whatever you want, just don't come over to my area.	Don't worry, I just came to check on my patients.
It just so happens I have a rich uncle who'd do anything for me, but I'd never call in that favor just to pay you to come over to my area!	Well, you don't have enough money.	Well, I wouldn't pay you.	You couldn't pay me to come over to your area.
Elliot, he's in V-tach.	I hate to interrupt, but I think you need to take a look at this man.	Got her!	It just so happens I have a rich uncle who'd do anything for me, but I'd never call in that favor just to pay you to come over to my area!
We need a one milligram Epi.	Get the crash cart.	Elliot, he's in V-tach.	I hate to interrupt, but I think you need to take a look at this man.
Well, I remember hiding in a supply closet.	I know.	Can you imagine us trying to do that three years ago?	Glad to do it. Oh, and, uh, Bart, I think Lyle might be ready for that rough-sex-play talk you had with your other boys.Too late!
Ultimately, conflict is resolved by remembering why you were friends in the first place.	That's the one.	Well, I remember hiding in a supply closet.	I know.
In the end, though, it doesn't really matter how you get there. As long as you're friends again.	Good Lord!	Or by uniting against a moment-stealing common enemy who took credit for your ingenious method of de-bulbing a patient's keister!	He's coming. He's coming! Get your ass out here!
We should go get coffee.	Me too.	I miss this. This, like, hanging out, you know?	In the end, though, it doesn't really matter how you get there. As long as you're friends again.
No, no, I mean like, like outside coffee real world coffee.The point is, we should...hang out outside the hospital sometime.	We're having coffee.	We should go get coffee.	Me too.
Is it fixed now?	J.D., I still need time. I know that's gonna be hard for you because you like to fix everything right way, but...you just do the best you can, okay?	No, no, I mean like, like outside coffee real world coffee.The point is, we should...hang out outside the hospital sometime.	We're having coffee.
Shoot!	Nope.	Is it fixed now?	J.D., I still need time. I know that's gonna be hard for you because you like to fix everything right way, but...you just do the best you can, okay?
Even though Councilman Donovan was handcuffed to that chair because once again he was flying high on crystal meth, his respect felt good. Honestly, it's the reason I keep voting for him.	HEEEY-AAAY!	Chief resident in the house! Everybody say hey-ay!	Anyway, the best thing about my new job is that I command a lot more respect.
Oh, what, is that supposed to intimidate me or something?	Just so you know, I think this chief resident thing has made you a little too big for your britches? Soo...from now on I'm gonna be your britches shrinker.	I've never seen Dr. Cox and Jordan speechless before. It was neat-o!	Well, mazel tovs all around!
What possible reason could you have for breaking your broom in half?	No. I had to do it anyway.	Oh, what, is that supposed to intimidate me or something?	Just so you know, I think this chief resident thing has made you a little too big for your britches? Soo...from now on I'm gonna be your britches shrinker.
Wise!	Play-Doh Pants became all about the money.	Better than Play-Doh Pants?	I like it.
Hey, you remember how I make more money than you now?	It felt good cheering Turk up. See, now that I'm chief studly, I was making a lot more money than him. Needless to say it was a time to be extra sensitive.	Wise!	Play-Doh Pants became all about the money.
Here's five bucks for remembering. Anyway, I was thinking about spending some of my extra ducats on one of those classy suits we always wanted!	Yeah?	Hey, you remember how I make more money than you now?	It felt good cheering Turk up. See, now that I'm chief studly, I was making a lot more money than him. Needless to say it was a time to be extra sensitive.
You know it, dawg!	You mean the leather purple jumpsuit Eddie Murphy wore in 'Raw'?	Here's five bucks for remembering. Anyway, I was thinking about spending some of my extra ducats on one of those classy suits we always wanted!	Yeah?
What's a question-talker?	That's cold!Look, I gotta go. I've got a new attending and he hates it when we're late. Plus he's a question-talker.	You know it, dawg!	You mean the leather purple jumpsuit Eddie Murphy wore in 'Raw'?
What are you doing?	Just because I lured her away from her perfect boyfriend and then dumped her doesn't mean my scooter, Sasha, needs to suffer.	Mmmm, it sends a message.	J.D., you have a scooter! Why do you even need a parking spot?
You can try as hard as you want, that is never gonna stick.	Just making it official.Chief. Co-Chief.	What are you doing?	Just because I lured her away from her perfect boyfriend and then dumped her doesn't mean my scooter, Sasha, needs to suffer.
Well, Mrs. Covello, your CAT-scan showed a small rectal tumor, so I want to schedule a low anterior resection. But don't worry, we have an amazing surgical team here, okay?	Would Co-Chief Dorian please report to the I.C.U.? Co-Chief Dorian? Co-Chief?	Yep, there was definitely trouble in paradise.	Look, Attilathere's no way in hell that I'm gonna listen to you complain about the rest of your life for the rest of my life, you got that?Jordan: Yeah, not listening. By the way, now that we're married again, we've gotta make out new wills in case one of us dies.Oh, God, I hope it's me.
Heh.	That means a lot coming from the co-chief resident!	Well, Mrs. Covello, your CAT-scan showed a small rectal tumor, so I want to schedule a low anterior resection. But don't worry, we have an amazing surgical team here, okay?	Would Co-Chief Dorian please report to the I.C.U.? Co-Chief Dorian? Co-Chief?
Dammit.	How did she hear? She's been in a coma for two weeks!	Heh.	That means a lot coming from the co-chief resident!
Sure.	Hey, buddy! Can I talk to you for a second?	Dammit.	How did she hear? She's been in a coma for two weeks!
What's the Todd doing?	I know the Todd's doing her resection, but if you send her down right now, he's a little busy so it'd have to be me.	Sure.	Hey, buddy! Can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah?	Yeah, well, you know the city surveyor is outside taking pictures of the hospital for the zoning commission?	What's the Todd doing?	I know the Todd's doing her resection, but if you send her down right now, he's a little busy so it'd have to be me.
Ha!	I told him they were shooting a Sacred Heart calendar.	Yeah?	Yeah, well, you know the city surveyor is outside taking pictures of the hospital for the zoning commission?
I don't know, Turk. It's a little early for me to start pulling strings I just got this co-chief job. Dammit, now I'm saying it!	Gentlemen! Say hello to June!How about a sneak-peek of July!	Ha!	I told him they were shooting a Sacred Heart calendar.
Mmmggghhh! Okay!	Come on, man, get me back in the game!	I don't know, Turk. It's a little early for me to start pulling strings I just got this co-chief job. Dammit, now I'm saying it!	Gentlemen! Say hello to June!How about a sneak-peek of July!
You know what, here's ten bucks for letting me help you out. Spend it wisely!	O-kay!Okay!	Mmmggghhh! Okay!	Come on, man, get me back in the game!
Well, as you may have heard from the loudspeaker, some residents, the janitor, my mother, your mother, and a...a coma patient, um, I'm being referred to as the "co-" chief resident. I think we should either both go with "co-chief" or "chief." Don't you...co-agree?	What about it?	Around here, there's always at least one person that'll come through for you.In Turk's case, that was me.J.D.: Hey, Elliot! Hey, I want to talk to you about this whole chief resident thing.	Tell me more about yourself.
Well, that's easy, Lonnie, what you want to do	Excuse me. We're working up this patient for a hypercoagulable state with a prolonged PTT? What's our next step?	Well, as you may have heard from the loudspeaker, some residents, the janitor, my mother, your mother, and a...a coma patient, um, I'm being referred to as the "co-" chief resident. I think we should either both go with "co-chief" or "chief." Don't you...co-agree?	What about it?
We're both chief residents. Isn't that right, Dr. Reid?	I'd like my answer from the chief resident.	Well, that's easy, Lonnie, what you want to do	Excuse me. We're working up this patient for a hypercoagulable state with a prolonged PTT? What's our next step?
It can be scary to stick your neck out for a friend. That's why it's a huge relief when they come through.	Oh, you know, I was on top of my game.	How'd surgery go?	Okay, that's it, and I'll get you later.
What?	Uh...unfortunately she didn't make it.	How's she doing?	It can be scary to stick your neck out for a friend. That's why it's a huge relief when they come through.
But I'm the chief resident. Look, Dr. Reid's check is made out to the chief resident, and and mine's made out to the co-chief resident. But we both make the same amount.	Well, it sounds like something you should take up with the chief resident.	Dr. Kelso, could you help me out? People have been referring to me as the co-chief resident.	Hey, you fixed him! Come on, buddy!J.D.'s Thoughts: That's it!
What, too hot?	OWWW!	Hey, man. Look what I confiscated from one of the kids in Pediatrics.	I could spend all day worrying about what just happened, but I have more important things to do.
Sorry.	YEAH!	What, too hot?	OWWW!
Okay, well, look, we both might have had bad days, but I got just the thing that's gonna cheer us up.Ahhh? Dream come true, right!	Not in the mood!	Sorry.	YEAH!
Oh, now I get it. You're just mad because I make more money than you.	Do you really think I want this suit?Well, I do. But not from you!	Okay, well, look, we both might have had bad days, but I got just the thing that's gonna cheer us up.Ahhh? Dream come true, right!	Not in the mood!
You are such a wuss!Turk, come on.Ah, these things chafe. Now I know why Eddie called it "Raw."Carla! Do you have any powder?	No, I'm mad because of that surgery today. You doubted me.	Oh, now I get it. You're just mad because I make more money than you.	Do you really think I want this suit?Well, I do. But not from you!
Okay....	Look, J.D., ever since you dumped me, everyone around here's been treating me like some kind of a victim. It's like, "Ohh, look at poor Elliot going home alone." Or, "Ohh, look at poor Elliot riding a tandem bike by herself." That's not something I normally do, I just really wanted ice cream the other night, my car was out of gas, and that's the bike the Gundersons loaned me. They do everything together....	What co-chief stuff? I haven't even been thinking about it.	Listen, I probably shoulda put a stop to all this co-chief stuff.
She's got fingers like biceps!	The point is it was nice being the one chief resident for a while, you know?	Okay....	Look, J.D., ever since you dumped me, everyone around here's been treating me like some kind of a victim. It's like, "Ohh, look at poor Elliot going home alone." Or, "Ohh, look at poor Elliot riding a tandem bike by herself." That's not something I normally do, I just really wanted ice cream the other night, my car was out of gas, and that's the bike the Gundersons loaned me. They do everything together....
Cheers.So! How you guys gonna celebrate your divorce?	Helps the tears taste less bitter.	Mm-mm.Thirsty, huh?	You have no chance of being normal.
Oh my God! Dude! I doubted you for a second, why are you so mad?	By not inviting you!	Cheers.So! How you guys gonna celebrate your divorce?	Helps the tears taste less bitter.
Nice work.Look, man, it was one second of doubt, okay? Since when do you care what anybody else thinks?	Yeah, she's been graveled.	Did you, uh...?	What the? Ow, ow, ow, what?
Aw, you'll kick ass.	I'm a little nervous about surgery tomorrow.	...or just picking up back where you left off.	Well, I'm gonna ignore it, but...yeah, knock yourself out.
Same!	Like a Christmas ham!	Are your giblets warm?	Well, I'll be in the bedroom with all the straight people.
And she's just been graveled!	Wow. Thanks, J.D.Ow!	The bottom line is that if you care about someone, it's pretty easy to make the sacrifice.	Same!
First of all, they were just big socks, okay? And secondly, if you need to do some laundry, here's the washboard, right?	The answer is yes, it was me who saw you doing leg lifts in the gym on that inflatable ball. It was quite the display of girl power. Absolutely loved the leg warmers!	Ooh, Dr. Cox, can I ask you something?	It's not.
As co-chief resident, I've noticed that some of my residents are a little overwhelmed. And I-I-I think it would be nice if you gave 'em one of your patented pep-talks, you know?	What do you want?	First of all, they were just big socks, okay? And secondly, if you need to do some laundry, here's the washboard, right?	The answer is yes, it was me who saw you doing leg lifts in the gym on that inflatable ball. It was quite the display of girl power. Absolutely loved the leg warmers!
Thank you...thank you, Dr. Cox.... Uhh, okay, guys, pizza and punch in the penthouse.Doug!Wrong patient one bed over.	That young man has killed so many patients, I'm starting to think he just might be a government operative.	Doug!!! Stop writing and go!	he just might go ahead and get himself a good clean kill this morning, seeing as his patient, Mrs. Samson, is in DKA and he hasn't been tracking her phosphate level. Her phosphate level. Her phosphate level.
Not just someone Dr. de Man.	Someone's gonna stick a needle in my chest?	Mr. Daniels, some fluid has gathered near your heart, so I'm gonna schedule a periocardiocentesis and drain it with a needle.	Of course not. Those things'll kill ya.
Say it...say it without the "Dr."	Who is Dr. de Man?	Not just someone Dr. de Man.	Someone's gonna stick a needle in my chest?
No, just say the the last name.	Who's Mr. de Man?	Say it...say it without the "Dr."	Who is Dr. de Man?
I'm de Man!	Who's de Man?	No, just say the the last name.	Who's Mr. de Man?
So I'll go ahead and schedule the procedure.	All right, now that you've got his confidence, drive it home.	I'm de Man!	Who's de Man?
I do.Dr. Cox, I want to thank you for that "everyone's a murderer" speech. Nice scare tactic. Unfortunately, my residents have stopped eating.	If you think it's the right thing to do.	So I'll go ahead and schedule the procedure.	All right, now that you've got his confidence, drive it home.
It's strange. Even though a lot of patients have died under my care, I don't think I've killed any of them....	That wasn't a scare tactic, Portia! Eventually everyone commits a sin of omission or doesn't act quickly enough, and somebody kicks the bucket. It's really...it's really not a question of "if" it's a question of "when."	I do.Dr. Cox, I want to thank you for that "everyone's a murderer" speech. Nice scare tactic. Unfortunately, my residents have stopped eating.	If you think it's the right thing to do.
Ooh! Maybe I'll have some flapjacks!	Get anything you want, dear.	Heaven's a diner?	It's strange. Even though a lot of patients have died under my care, I don't think I've killed any of them....
No flapjacks in heaven!?! Are flapjacks evil?	They don't have those.	Ooh! Maybe I'll have some flapjacks!	Get anything you want, dear.
They say what they miss most are those lazy summer afternoons on the Moselle River.	Ah.	Uh, outside Mertert, near the German border.	What are the odds? Just stay vague.
Bullet dodged! He totally bought it! Hey, where's he taking me?	Okay. Okay, then.	You are channeling that seventh grade book report!	They say what they miss most are those lazy summer afternoons on the Moselle River.
Can I talk to you for a second?	Can't talk now, good stuff's happenin'!	Hey, Turk, can I talk to you for a second?	Okay.
I have to go.	Giant Adam's apple!	"Eyebrows." Like that's gonna make youElliot, come on, you can't be that insecure.	Eyebrows.
This needle is too sticky! I'm out! Get it together, Laverne!	Elliot's comment didn't bother me, because I'm proud of the body God gave me.Besides, I had bigger problems. I had to do Mr. Daniels' procedure. Luckily I'm a professional, and professionals finish the job.	I have to go.	Giant Adam's apple!
Who?	Hey, Peggy? Yes, I noticed the turtleneck choice in August, and can only assume it's got something to do with that grapefruit you store in your trachea. Let me put your mind at ease: You've killed before.	This needle is too sticky! I'm out! Get it together, Laverne!

Whoa. Bye-bye.	Do you remember Mrs. Carter?	Who?	Hey, Peggy? Yes, I noticed the turtleneck choice in August, and can only assume it's got something to do with that grapefruit you store in your trachea. Let me put your mind at ease: You've killed before.
She died?	Wahoooo!	Whoa. Bye-bye.	Do you remember Mrs. Carter?
The weird thing was that I was a little happy.	Three days ago of endocarditis. You didn't get blood cultures and you missed it. You happy?	She died?	Wahoooo!
You know what, I don't appreciate lying.	Ooh, did I trick Newbie? I did, didn't I!	Mrs. Carter?	Mmm.
One of the hardest things around here is that sometimes you don't get to know how things end.	Come on. I know you're scared. A lot of times you feel like a little girl in a big gal's body. But here's the dirty little secret: Fear is good. It keeps you from becoming a crappy doctor. Trick is you just can't let it paralyze you. But don't you worry about a thing, there, Newbie. You're a sure thing to get a kill. In fact, should be any day now!	You know what, I don't appreciate lying.	Ooh, did I trick Newbie? I did, didn't I!
Ultimately it'll drive you crazy if you don't have a friend to help you through it.	Okay, everybody, watch closely, because if you're not careful, you can cause a pneumothorax.	...Whether it's wondering if your husband will realize you replaced his dead dog with a shorter replica......Or wondering when and if you're gonna kill that first person.	They look really good.
Sorry, that's all he can say. Anyway, you don't have liver disease you have inoperable lung cancer.	Liver disease! Liver disease!	Come on, Carla, I wanted a hook and I only had one other idea.Mr. Hawkins, the results of your tests are back, and you have	You two are idiots!
If only, Chauncy.Bottom line, that tape recorder won't fly away and break your heart.	Liver disease!	Sorry, that's all he can say. Anyway, you don't have liver disease you have inoperable lung cancer.	Liver disease! Liver disease!
I like toast.	I love my new tape recorder. Not only is it a time-saver, I can record my every thought.	Gesundheit!	Are you crazy? No, Turk. But
They aren't all winners. Still, as long as I have this thing, I don't need to be in my head so much.	I like toast.	I love my new tape recorder. Not only is it a time-saver, I can record my every thought.	Gesundheit!
Sorry I'm late! I was recording some thoughts and I slipped and fell.	Wet floor.	Aaaaaaaaaaaaagh!	He is so sweet! But why doesn't he just put up a sign that says "wet floor"?
Possible nicknames for Dr. Cox when we become best friends: The Coxinator. Cox of Seagulls. Hooooooog!	Gimme this!	Sorry I'm late! I was recording some thoughts and I slipped and fell.	Wet floor.
M'kay, I'll see you guys.AAAAGGGHHH!!!	And finally, a dose of fear.	Now, I just want you to know, you guys all have the potential to be amazing doctors.	Next, inspiration.
AAAGGGHHH!	Agh!	M'kay, I'll see you guys.AAAAGGGHHH!!!	And finally, a dose of fear.
AGH!	Agh!	AAAGGGHHH!	Agh!
I'm sorry I'm late, but I was singing and I fell. And I know I've used the falling excuse before, but it happened again!	GLORIA! You're supposed to start pre-rounds at 7 o'clock. It's now 7:03.	I'm feeling so good today!I still feel good, 'cause nobody saw me fall!That sound you're hearing is my residents' respect. It feels good.	God, that felt great! Huh. Hopefully it won't have ramifications for anyone else.
Oh. That's way cooler.	No! Not every night. On the weekends I didn't have to be in bed by 11, but I had to be in my room.	You had a bedtime when you were seventeen?	Dude, I've got my own problems! I've got a bedtime again! I haven't had a bedtime in like twelve years!
Carla's setting some kind of record on being a major pain the ass, and I can't help you.	The point is Carla's setting some kind of record on being a major pain in the ass, and I can't help you.	Oh. That's way cooler.	No! Not every night. On the weekends I didn't have to be in bed by 11, but I had to be in my room.
So how's about you learn to walk, ditch the tape recorder, and act like you got a pair!	I didn't yell at ya.	You yelled at me in front of my residents!	We didn't order any of the pain in the ass.
Can you pull off contrite?	Fair enough. Later on today when you are with your residents, I'll come up for something, you'll tell me you're too busy in a manly way, and I will contritely turn around and walk out of the room with my tail between my legs. Problem solved.	You ruined my credibility! Now look me in the eyes and tell me that's not messed up!	Here I was thinking the same thing, Bob. Let's do this again.Tell you what, there, Gidget, if you promise to leave right now, I won't yell at you in front of your peons anymore.
Should have seen that coming.	Can you pull off manly way?	Can you pull off contrite?	Fair enough.

Problem solved.
You bet your ass I am.	Are you really doing this?	Oh, and another thing.From now on, I'd prefer it if you'd address me as "Dr. Dorian."	Oh. My fault, I'll come back later.
I simply will not tolerate it, Perry! And neither will my boys!	Wrap it up, there, bingo.	You bet your ass I am.	Are you really doing this?
It was worth it.Lonnie, slap the face!All of you, slap your faces!Awesome.	The next minute you find yourself alone, I'm gonna kill ya.	I simply will not tolerate it, Perry! And neither will my boys!	Wrap it up, there, bingo.
Whoooagh! Ow! Lonnie! Damn you!	As I watched Elliot and Molly walk off, and thought about how Lonnie was a much less stable giant doctor base than Turk, I realized how important it is to have someone close to you that you can count on.	Hello, tiny ladies! I don't believe we've met! I'm the world's most giant doctor! Nice to	Yeah, I've dated some pretty immature guys, too.
Especially if that someone is a resident that can keep Dr. Cox from killing you.	Whoooagh! Ow! Lonnie! Damn you!

Not in front of my boys! This is Lonnie! He's one of my boys!Not sure what that means. See you later.	Especially if that someone is a resident that can keep Dr. Cox from killing you.	Whoooagh! Ow!

In my case, it was best just to keep my distance.	That was too easy. No way I'm doing that seven nights a week.	Sometimes you have to keep people closer than you'd like.	Not in front of my boys! This is Lonnie! He's one of my boys!Not sure what that means. See you later.
I wonder if we're going to a happy place?	Can I have a word with you?Go.	In my case, it was best just to keep my distance.	That was too easy. No way I'm doing that seven nights a week.
Dammit!	I don't know, maybe we should work on that... together.	Dammit! Molly, you're a shrink: why is it my daydreams always end right before the sexy part.	Yeah, me too.
Snap out of it! Abort! ABORT!	Dude! Relax... and enjoy hot chocolate love.	Dammit!	I don't know, maybe we should work on that... together.
There's ice cream in the fridge.	Dad died.	Dan.	What, a guy can't take three days off work, travel eight hundred miles on a bus with a double-layer fudge cake just to say "Hey, how're things?"
Dan, I love you, but being there for people isn't really yo' thang.	Oh, it will eventually. But don't worry when it does, Big Bro' will be there.What? What is it?	I don't know... it hasn't really hit me yet.	How you doing, buddy?
Dan, you've been in here for, like, nine hours: you okay?	No, that was Old Dan. Look at me: this is New Dan! I'm totally here for you.	Dan, I love you, but being there for people isn't really yo' thang.	Oh, it will eventually. But don't worry when it does, Big Bro' will be there.What? What is it?
No, look, I put a six-pack for you in the toilet.	Yeah, today doesn't look good by the way, could you get me another beer?	You think you'll get out of the tub today?	Well, it wasn't exactly easy for me, either. You have Dad's butt.
I gotta go to work!	Ooh.	No, look, I put a six-pack for you in the toilet.	Yeah, today doesn't look good by the way, could you get me another beer?
... although sometimes, it's a little awkward, even with an old friend.	Walk tall, kiddo.	Even though I deal with death every time I walk into this place, I never dealt with it from this side before. It's full of surprises, whether it's a small gesture from a co-worker...... or a big gesture from someone you've never even met before.	Nothing.
Hey.	Hey.	... although sometimes, it's a little awkward, even with an old friend.	Walk tall, kiddo.
Yeah.	I just wanted to...	Hey.	Hey.
Thanks.	Look...	Yeah.	I just wanted to...
'Kay.	'Kay.	Thanks.	Look...
Well, I didn't ask you to do any of that, did I?	In a minute! Hey, Newbie? Just in case you didn't actually notice, I have been covering all your patients, answering all your pages, and doing pretty much everything shy of picking up your sundress from the drycleaners.	You know what sucks? I thought you were actually going to come through for me this time.	Look, Newbie. Oh, for God's sake. I'm a little swamped, here. Thank you.
Oh, really, why not?	Newbie, don't shove me.	You know what, I am sick of getting dumped on, and I am sick of you!	No, I'm I'm really trying.
When someone shoves you like this?	Because whenever anyone shoves me more than twice, my mind goes blank and all I see is this white-hot flash of fury.	Oh, really, why not?	Newbie, don't shove me.
Really?	I... have type II diabetes.	What's the occasion?	Yeah!
That sucks. Carla is aware that if you eat that your foot will fall off, right?	Yeah.	Really?	I... have type II diabetes.
You can tell me anything.	I'm not sure. Can I tell you something weird, though?	Why haven't you told her?	Oh, hell yeah!
Oh my God, just this second I was thinking your diabetes is gonna get in the way of my dad dying. Isn't that funny?	I feel like your dad dying has stolen my diabetes thunder.	You can tell me anything.	I'm not sure. Can I tell you something weird, though?
The trunk was filled with boxes of 'em!	Meanwhile, he gets to work the next morning, and he realises he's got a million of 'em in the trunk of his car.	And it's our dad, aand he's ranting and raving because he's an office supply salesman and he can't find a paper clip in the entire house.	Of course, sometimes it's not about the words...... it's just about having someone there to listen.
Oh, come on, if you do, I promise that every time I hit the buzzer I'll act like I'm getting electrocuted, like this:	No.	Ah-haa! Ha-haaa! Let's play again.	That depends, what are we talking about?
I always thought that was a little bigoted for a cookie.	They're Milanos, you idiot.	Mmmmm, Mulattos.	Turk's blood sugar was low because he has Type II diabetes and hasn't figured out his medication yet.
You bar tend three shifts a week.	Boy, nothing like a little time off to remind you how hard you been working, huh?	Cookie racism aside, I had bigger problems. It had been three weeks since our dad died, and my brother Dan was still staying with me.	I always thought that was a little bigoted for a cookie.
I'm sorry, sugar, this store is closed.	Can I buy you a drink?	Oh, hellooo. Women are checking me out lately. Was it the ten push-ups I've been cranking out every other Sunday? Perhaps. More likely it was the pledge I made not to date anyone until Elliot did. See, since then, the gals have been all over me.	Mm.
Very impressive, but I'm sorry.	They've been all over me.	I'm sorry, sugar, this store is closed.	Can I buy you a drink?
Hey!Woooogh!	...on-call room nookie. Hello, my old friend, how I've missed you.Yes, it does.Time out, male moaning! Party's over!	The key to sleeping in the on-call room is to block out the noises around you like snoring, teeth-grinding, or even....	She doesn't know she's taking them.
I'm okay with it.	J.D., let me explain. I came to the hospital to see you, and then I ran into Elliot and it just happened. It was a one-time thing.	Listen, Dan	I knew it was my turn to let Dan have it, but for some reason I wasn't mad.
Our dad.	Great, 'cause it's been going on for a few weeks. Elliot's amazing! Smart, funny...hhhot. I was in a dark place and she saved me, she really did. Haven't felt this good since my dad died.	I'm okay with it.	J.D., let me explain. I came to the hospital to see you, and then I ran into Elliot and it just happened. It was a one-time thing.
Unless, God forbid, they find a cure.	Exactly. But you gotta use it before that window closes. Lucky for me, my diabetes window stays open 24/7.	Oh my God! This could be my diabetes!	Thanks, sweetness!
I wanna talk to you for a second! Can you turn that thing off?	Thanks for the loaner scooter, Johnny!	Turk was right. Lying to Elliot was the perfect way to get our friendship back to normal.	Bye, folks. You'll notice I knocked a hundred dollars off the bill because of the, uh, you know, baby-stealing thing.
GUYS! THERE ARE SICK PEOPLE TRYING TO SLEEP!	Okie-dokie.	Look, when I caught you two yesterday, I didn't know what to say. But now I do. You really hurt me.	Sorry!
Well how would you feel if I hooked up with one of your siblings?	J.D., are you really this upset?	GUYS! THERE ARE SICK PEOPLE TRYING TO SLEEP!	Okie-dokie.
Barry?	A little confused considering I have four brothers. But not surprised. At you or Barry.	Well how would you feel if I hooked up with one of your siblings?	J.D., are you really this upset?
Well obviously you did, or you woulda told me about it from the beginning.	I guess I just didn't think I was doing anything wrong.	Barry?	A little confused considering I have four brothers. But not surprised. At you or Barry.
Sometimes a plan can crystallize in a moment.	Goodnight, amigos.	There's nothing more satisfying than having a good plan.	No, I think I broke my hand.
AAAAGGGHHH! What are you doing back in the tub!?	Hey, little brother.	Of course, in my plan nobody gets hurt.	I know it's a dream job, but with your diabetes I think you need me more.
...Except my brother.	Elliot dumped me.	AAAAGGGHHH! What are you doing back in the tub!?	Hey, little brother.
Dan!	G'day, J.D.	Oh, come on, don't go. We can watch 'Kangaroo Jack' and chug a Foster's every time they say "g'day"!	You know what, J.D.? Elliot and I were supposed to have a big romantic evening together, and look at all this stuff I bought. Candles. Champagne. A Dido CD. I guess I'll just throw these things out with rest of the garbage.
Dido?	Dido. And you've really got to meet my brother Barry.	I love champagne. You mind if I have a little? Thank you. A nipper!Ahh! Tingly! It's a tingly drink! Oooooh! Pretty candles! Anyhoo, I know you broke up with Dan because you thought I was upset, but in reality, I...uh...I... "I want to thank you! For giving me the best day of my life..." I love this song, who is it?	Yeah. Yeah, I was celebrating my...new jammies.
Dan?	Look at all this stuff I bought. Candles. Champagne. A Dido CD.	Dido?	Dido. And you've really got to meet my brother Barry.
AAGGHH!	Hey, little brother!	Dan?	Look at all this stuff I bought. Candles. Champagne. A Dido CD.
That's when I realized that Elliot and I had absolutely no romantic feeling for each other anymore.No matter what the situation.It was a little sad, but, who knows? Maybe it meant we could be friends again.	I don't know I I just didn't.	I don't know. I just...wasn't.	How could you not be mad that I was hooking up with your brother?
If my heart could write songs, they'd sound like these.	Hey! I can't find my Dido CD!	That's when I realized that Elliot and I had absolutely no romantic feeling for each other anymore.No matter what the situation.It was a little sad, but, who knows? Maybe it meant we could be friends again.	I don't know I I just didn't.
What was that for?	'Night, J.D.	And for Elliot and I...turns out all we needed was a little time.	Oh, goodnight, Dan. Sleep tight. There's a bus schedule underneath your pillow.
Can I buy you a drink?	The good news was this Elliot and Dan thing meant that I was back on the market!	What was that for?	'Night, J.D.
Yep! I'm back, baby!	No thanks.	Can I buy you a drink?	The good news was this Elliot and Dan thing meant that I was back on the market!
You know, Elliot, since I broke your heart, I've held my tongue every time you've been a wiseacre. But now that you slept with my brother, we're even. So if you bring sarcasm my way, baby, prepare to be stung!	Oh, yeah. You know Mrs. Wilson back there? She made her spleen pretend to rupture, and then she pretended to die.Got me again, there, Mrs. Wilson!	You ever get the feeling our patients pretend to be sicker when we're around?	Ohh!
So's your face.	J.D.	You know, Elliot, since I broke your heart, I've held my tongue every time you've been a wiseacre. But now that you slept with my brother, we're even.

"So's your face" always makes sense.	That doesn't even make any sense.	So's your face.	J.D.
So's your face! I'm on fire! Helloooo!	J.D., that's stupid.	"So's your face" always makes sense.	That doesn't even make any sense.
I don't know, Elliot. Molly and I really aren't that close.	Yes, top twenty!	Calm down, Twelve.	You actually rank the women of this hospital by their appearance?
OW! DOUG! WHY!? AAAGGGHHH!AAAGGGHHH! The sinks are broken! The sinks are broken! Hot! Hot! Hot, hot, hot, hot!So your nephew is six, huh? That's a crazy age!	All right! Stand back, everyone! I'll handle this!	Will you excuse me a moment?AAAAGGGGHHHHH! PUT ME OUT! PUT ME OUT!	...goes through like the whole day that he's grown up! Oh my God, I love it.
Eventually things wound down. Some people went home....Some just went to bed....	Sorry I'm late. Player had a date. Anybody want some chocolate?	After the fire marshal closed down the bar, we took the party back to our place.	OW! DOUG! WHY!? AAAGGGHHH!AAAGGGHHH! The sinks are broken! The sinks are broken! Hot! Hot! Hot, hot, hot, hot!So your nephew is six, huh? That's a crazy age!
And that's how Molly and I ended up alone on the couch, watching that unbelievably romantic scene from '16 Candles'.No, not that one! This one.	'Night.	Eventually things wound down. Some people went home....Some just went to bed....	Sorry I'm late. Player had a date. Anybody want some chocolate?
God bless Molly Ringwald. And this Molly. Ah, the hell with it! God bless Mollys everywhere!	Happy birthday, Samantha.	And that's how Molly and I ended up alone on the couch, watching that unbelievably romantic scene from '16 Candles'.No, not that one! This one.	'Night.
Heh, yeah, now that we're friends and there's no chance of us ever having sex again, there's really not a whole lot I "need" from you, okay? So g'head and give it your best shot.	Admit we're not even or I'll make you pay.	Elliot, once you're even, you can't just go back to being not even. That ain't new, girl!	Now that you made out with my best friend, that makes us not even again. So go get me some cotton balls and a toe separator mama needs a pedicure! Heh.
You were saying?	J.D., you just don't have that edgy mean streak that I'm attracted to.	Comin' at you, Shinski!People can die from beer, Molly. Shinski didn't, but our friendship did.	Hey, yo, J.D., toss me a beer, man.
At that very moment, I feared I had divulged too much.	My emotional journey began at five years old when I walked in on my parents having sex in a position my father would later playfully describe as "the jackhammer." I have a mentor that verbally abuses me every chance he gets, and no matter how much I try, I can't stop constantly narrating my own life.	Sometimes all it takes is a slammin' hottie to make you dig down deep and discover who you really are.	Look, I'm sorry, but I'm attracted to damaged, dysfunctional people, and you're just too normal.
Molly, I'm narcissistic, I'm pessimistic, I'm obsessive, I'm insecure. And I am so afraid of intimacy that every one of my relationships is a journey of self-sabotage that inevitably ends in a black vacuum of shattered expectations and despair.

Just tell me who!	You just need to clear it with one person first.	No. But you won't know until after.	D'you think you can handle it?
That doesn't even make any sense!	No.	Just tell me who!	You just need to clear it with one person first.
Dammit! Walked into that one!	So's your face!	That doesn't even make any sense!	No.
Okay, Sasha, let's see what your new engine can do!	I'm not gonna do that. But, I will write you a note.	But Molly just left, so you have to call her at home!	Thank you.
Yes! It's good! You surgeons are idiots!	Hang on, I'm doing my diabetes test. Ninety eight, is that a good number?	Turk, it's me!	Hello?
He took it.I can't run in this gown, it's too loose!	You got your phone?	I was treed by that coyote!	Sorry, dude. Where were you?
I agree, but my legs are cramping!	I can't run in these jeans, they're too constricting!Yeah, this is much better!	He took it.I can't run in this gown, it's too loose!	You got your phone?
I was kneeling on a nest!	You spent too much time crouching in that tree, didn't you!	I agree, but my legs are cramping!	I can't run in these jeans, they're too constricting!Yeah, this is much better!
Oh my God. I'll never get down there before she leaves! This is the worst moment of my life.	Dude, she's outside. She's about to get in the cab!	Sorry, wrong apartment.Konichiwa.	It's not my wife, is it, Debbie?
You're right. Gimme that gown!	Or is it the greatest moment of your life?	Oh my God. I'll never get down there before she leaves! This is the worst moment of my life.	Dude, she's outside. She's about to get in the cab!
Hey, this isn't that scary. Uh-oh!	Go get her, buddy!	You're right. Gimme that gown!	Or is it the greatest moment of your life?
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!	Take care.	I think the easiest way to lose something is to want it too badly.	J.D., I think this note's for you.
Nothing. How can I help you?	What smells like Vagisil?	Why?After spreading half a tube of what I thought was burn	Hit him again baby.

Fine. Turk, tell her our code.	Girls! I want an explanation.	Oh, I hope it was summer. I'm not that big a skier.	One time we went to Aspen.
Four a half times! Lata!	Plus, you already had sex with her.	Fine. But I'm only ending it because friends come first.	I want you to stop seeing her.

God help me, I do. I do love a dirty table.	You love a dirty table.	Oh, I hate a dirty table.	And as the ultimate act of betrayal, you will do it on the very same
Punish me? How?You know what, no, this is crazy. I am not going to get your nameAnd that's when I realized I would never be strong enough	If you talk about ending our relationship again, I'll punish you.	My talk with Carla gave me the courage to take a stand.	Ah, yes. Yes yes. Well, your paper script looks good. But, I'm
Okay.	Oh, there you are. Go get in the backseat of my car and lie down on	I was talking to myself.	I'll be fine.
Oh, it's so on.	Neena, a word?	Okay.	Oh, there you are. Go get in the backseat of my car and lie down on
The thing about strong women... If you call them out,	You got something to say? Say it.	Oh, it's so on.	Neena, a word?
Yeah!	Ouch.	And just like that we all knew who had won.	You come in here and walk around like you're the queen bee. Guess
I'm free?	Okay. Fine, it's over.	Yeah!	Ouch.
Jordan's making me stretch out her new jeans.	Not so fast. You're my bitch now.	Wow. Thanks, Jordan. I'll see you around.	Awesome.
And the truth was, he did understand. No matter how much	It's okay, man. She's a woman. I understand.	Turk, I'm sorry about Neena.	Hit you on the fly! Fifteen-love!
Oh, he's slow.	Waaaaaaiiiiit!	Go get her, Turk!	Baby?
Oh, my God, a journal!	Hey, I bought you a present.	Time to go see my favorite patient, Mr. Gregory Marks. He may need a new kidney, but he sure as hell doesn't need a new heart.	Oh, he's slow.
I can't wait to chronicle this one! Oh God!	Well, you seem like the kind of sensitive young buck that likes to chronicle his feelings.	Oh, my God, a journal!	Hey, I bought you a present.
Awesome. Well...let me check your chart and s-see if we're a match!	Oh, no, I would definitely take it! I would take it with my bare hands.	I gotta tell you, Mr. Marks even though I know you'd never take it, I'd give you one of my kidneys in a second.	I can't wait to chronicle this one! Oh God!
I'm so sorry.	Please don't be a match! Please don't be a match! Blood type O! Not a match! Yes!! Yes!! Yes!! Yes!!	Awesome. Well...let me check your chart and s-see if we're a match!	Oh, no, I would definitely take it! I would take it with my bare hands.
Ah, that's a horse with a sword on his head, and he's there to guard my hopes and dreams.	Look, Newbie, there are times a man wants to keep something to himself. Like, say, he's got a son. Or he's 29-years-old and keeps a journal with a unicorn drawn on the cover?	Anyway, know Mr. Marks? He said he doesn't have any family to be a kidney donor? But he's got a son! We gotta find this guy!	Oh, right.
Eventually someone's gonna miss me, Jerry!	Come on, if the guy didn't tell you about his son, I'm sure he had a pretty good reason. You know, you always do this you get too involved in your patients' lives. And just exactly how does that usually work out for ya?	Ah, that's a horse with a sword on his head, and he's there to guard my hopes and dreams.	Look, Newbie, there are times a man wants to keep something to himself. Like, say, he's got a son. Or he's 29-years-old and keeps a journal with a unicorn drawn on the cover?
You don't look busy.	I'm busy.	Excuse me, are you Murray Marks?	I'll tell you something about 'Wings' they really got it right.
Shouldn't you call the fire department or something!?!	Okay. Pull up, 117. Pull up.Hello?Hello?We lost 'em.	Take it! TAKE IT!	Oh, God! We've lost the other engine!
Oh, come on, no it isn't!	Well, for starters, he named me "Murray." That's an old man's name!	All right, we what's the problem with your dad?	So close.
Murray!	MURRAY!Everything my father's ever done was designed to humiliate me.	Oh, come on, no it isn't!	Well, for starters, he named me "Murray." That's an old man's name!
No, the youngest Murray!	What.	Murray!	MURRAY!Everything my father's ever done was designed to humiliate me.
He's dead.	Look, you obviously have some issues with your own father that you're projecting on to me. So why don't you go ahead and give him a jingle?	Look, Murray, it doesn't matter that your father's handsome and charismatic and sings like a young Joan Baez. He's your flesh and blood, and you gotta step up.	Thank you...Glen.
No, I'm serious.	Good stuff!	He's dead.	Look, you obviously have some issues with your own father that you're projecting on to me. So why don't you go ahead and give him a jingle?
He had like a massive heart attack.	Classic!	No, I'm serious.	Good stuff!
Now, about the kidney....	I'm sorry for your loss.	He had like a massive heart attack.	Classic!
Make the "flesh and blood" argument again but in a different way.	I wish I could fly my plane right now. I always like to fly it when I have to make a big decision.	Now, about the kidney....	I'm sorry for your loss.
Jackpot!	I'll do it!	Blood and flesh, Murray.	Make the "flesh and blood" argument again but in a different way.
One for the road, Glen?Thanks! Happy weekend!	Yawning, Glen!	Jackpot!	I'll do it!
Oh, no.	Hey, Newbie! The good news is that Murray and his dad are a match, kidney-wise. The better news is that the test revealed a little secret you're gonna wanna share with your new pal. Gregory is not Murray's biological father!	"I told you so" moments are rare. So when they come, you have to savor them.	That's the way female doctors around here behave, I hope the young lady I'm interviewing is a different breed. Do either of you know where I can find Dr. Elliot Reid?
Dammit!	By the by? This moment is so great, I'd cheat on that other moment from before, marry this one and raise a family of tiny little moments.	Oh, no.	Hey, Newbie! The good news is that Murray and his dad are a match, kidney-wise. The better news is that the test revealed a little secret you're gonna wanna share with your new pal. Gregory is not Murray's biological father!
Murray!	I'm outta here!	Well, Dr. Kels Well, Dr. Kelso, I'm just gonna tell him. Murray's got a good heart, and he'll do the right thing.	What are you going to do, son?
Not you, Old Murray!	Whaaat?	Murray!	I'm outta here!
You've been great as usual.There you are! Hi, buddy!	You got the number from Jordan, didn't you. She hates me.	Fine! Maybe I got too involved like you said. But would it kill you for once to acknowledge that my heart is in the right place instead of spending all your time berating me?	Yeah, but, it's very important we focus on the whole "who gave you this number" issue.
What an odd sized explosion.	Hey...!Ohh, ohh! I'm a doctor! I'm a doctor! Everything can't get to me!	You've been great as usual.There you are! Hi, buddy!	You got the number from Jordan, didn't you. She hates me.
Been there with my gram-gram....	He's not my dad, he's my fake dad. Which means what my fake cousin Samantha and I almost did in the tenth grade would have been beautiful...and right.	Anyhoo, what do you think your dad is doing right now?	It's what I do.
Remember? Recently deceased dad?	Why do you keep talking about your boss like he's your father?	Sometimes Dr. Cox is all over me, like every second of my life.	No. Not ever.
Yes! I mean, yes.	Massive heart attack!	Remember? Recently deceased dad?	Why do you keep talking about your boss like he's your father?
...Maybe I got too involved with Murray and his fake real dad. But as I watched Gregory serenade a clearly uncomfortable Murray, I realized something.	Hey, good lookin'! Whaa'cha got cookin'...	As for me...	Huh!
If Murray could look past his dad's imperfections and appreciate all the time he'd given him, maybe I owe Dr. Cox a thank-you for the same thing.	Heeey, sweet baby! Dooon'cha think maybe...	...Maybe I got too involved with Murray and his fake real dad. But as I watched Gregory serenade a clearly uncomfortable Murray, I realized something.	Hey, good lookin'! Whaa'cha got cookin'...
Now wrap it all up with a slow motion hand wave.Oh, I'm slooooow, baby.	My pleasure.	Hey. I just wanted to take a second to thank you for constantly berating me, doubting my abilities, and the overall devastation of my self-esteem.	If Murray could look past his dad's imperfections and appreciate all the time he'd given him, maybe I owe Dr. Cox a thank-you for the same thing.
Like a bear to honey.	You didn't go to the black family yelling at the movie screen stereotype, did you?	Shhhh!	Ohh, don't go behind the kidney, brotha!
Buckle up, buddy!	Oh, don't worry. I gotcha.	Like a bear to honey.	You didn't go to the black family yelling at the movie screen stereotype, did you?
Hey, kids, I'm Dr. Dorian. I'm sure you have lots of questions, so let's get started.So, basically it's a topical application consisting of equal parts triethanolamine and phenyl dimethicone. I suggest applying it twice a day for extra hold. Okay? Here's a sample tube, Reuben. Excellent query.Okay, then, anybody else?	Hell yeah!	Buckle up, buddy!	Oh, don't worry. I gotcha.
I-I'd say my best moment was probably my second year, New Year's Eve. A young pregnant woman could barely make it into the hospital, she had her baby right there on the ramp.	What was your best moment in medicine?	Hey, kids, I'm Dr. Dorian. I'm sure you have lots of questions, so let's get started.So, basically it's a topical application consisting of equal parts triethanolamine and phenyl dimethicone. I suggest applying it twice a day for extra hold. Okay? Here's a sample tube, Reuben. Excellent query.Okay, then, anybody else?	Hell yeah!
It's a waffle cone.	Thanks.	Sure....	Hey! You brought Tyler a new ice cream cone!
There are other ways you can get it.Dr. Cox.	Don't you get that from kissing?	It's a waffle cone.	Thanks.
Mr. Milligan? His blood pressure's a little low; he just has mono.	Newbie! You never promise a patient that they're gonna be fine!	Agh!That's one more point for Mrs. Cross. But let's see how she enjoys her beloved hard candy without ... her choppers!	Phyllis. Outside.What the hell was that in there?
I did feel it. And I knew what Carla was gonna say before she said it.	Oh, for God's sakes, Newbie, take a look around, would you please? What's the difference between your Mr. Milligan and every other patient in this I.C.U.? And if the answer to that question is that he's the only one young enough to have never made a phone call like this: "Brring! Hello? Operator? Give me ," then you'd be right. But since I'm not in the mood to make some big, dramatic, sweeping statement, I'll just tell you this: God hates doctors, He truly does. You see all these old people in here? Well, any of 'em would give just about anything to be able to sashay off this planet, but most of 'em are gonna stay and they're gonna live forever and ever and ever. And your Mr. Milligan, well, it turns out he's just young enough to die. I mean, think about it: It's the holidays, there's a sweet little kid involved. Can't you just feel it?	Mr. Milligan? His blood pressure's a little low; he just has mono.	Newbie! You never promise a patient that they're gonna be fine!
Turk! Hey! If you go talk to Kelso for me, I'll give you this special Christmas gum.	Hey, J.D. Turns out Mr. Milligan doesn't have insurance. Dr. Kelso said once he's stable we have to bounce him to County.	That I will not do!	Well, I'd definitely give Mrs. Cross her teeth back.
I'm sorry, what?	I gave that kid some money and sent him outside the hospital, and now I can't find him.	Why does it seem like every time I take a stand, everything turns to crap?	I'm kidding. Enough of the backseat doctoring I got this.
You gotta be kidding me.	Kelso said, no insurance, you gotta stabilize the guy and then bounce him.	I'm sorry, what?	I gave that kid some money and sent him outside the hospital, and now I can't find him.
Why are you sick?	I'll tell you what, in about ten more minutes none of this is gonna matter, because this guy's circling the drain.	You gotta be kidding me.	Kelso said, no insurance, you gotta stabilize the guy and then bounce him.
Kids can kick pretty hard. Maybe he ruptured his spleen?	Wrestling.Remember? He said his kid dropped him with a power kick.	I'm a kite! I'm a big, beautiful kite! Fly!	What?
Come on, it turns out Mr. Milligan has a ruptured spleen. We're prepping him for surgery in room C.	I got gummed.	What the hell are you doing?	It's Beardfacé!
So?	That's the room where the family gets to observe.	Come on, it turns out Mr. Milligan has a ruptured spleen. We're prepping him for surgery in room C.	I got gummed.
So you think you're a robot mechanic?	So, dude, you don't understand. When I operate, I don't see a person, I see a machine with parts that need to be replaced and circuits that need to be rewired.	So?	That's the room where the family gets to observe.
Well, I wouldn't worry about that. Mr. Milligan only has a son and Elliot lost him.	As a surgeon, the more detached I am, the more focused I am. And it's pretty impossible to feel focused or detached when this guy's family's watching every move I make.	So you think you're a robot mechanic?	So, dude, you don't understand. When I operate, I don't see a person, I see a machine with parts that need to be replaced and circuits that need to be rewired.
Ah.	Awesome! For me.	Well, I wouldn't worry about that. Mr. Milligan only has a son and Elliot lost him.	As a surgeon, the more detached I am, the more focused I am. And it's pretty impossible to feel focused or detached when this guy's family's watching every move I make.
All right, you guys, we still got a lot of work to do. Turk, why don't you go check the post-op films in radiology; and Carla will transfuse back to a hemoglobin ten; and Elliot, why don't you take Tyler and go get us all ice cream immediately.I'm gonna go check on him. You wanna come?	Who's the man!	None of us wanted to say what we were thinking: How vulnerable we felt. So we all just stood around, pretending to work, and waited for someone to come through that door and tell us how this was gonna end.	Dr. Turk? Thanks.
It's amazing how one patient can affect so many people.	No. No, you got it.	All right, you guys, we still got a lot of work to do. Turk, why don't you go check the post-op films in radiology; and Carla will transfuse back to a hemoglobin ten; and Elliot, why don't you take Tyler and go get us all ice cream immediately.I'm gonna go check on him. You wanna come?	Who's the man!
My best moment...? Well, there was this guy...	Dr. Dorian? What was your best moment in medicine?	It's amazing how one patient can affect so many people.	No. No, you got it.
You got the tiny post-its! Aww, awesome! For our tiny bulletin board! Aaaand I have a dentist appointment that got moved to Tuesday at 4 PM.

But it was still very startling!	J.D.! You knew I was gonna do that!	So, Lonnie, get in here and see the effects of cirrhosis of the liver.	Still, it's not like we didn't keep the interns on their toes.
I honestly didn't understand how she could do so many things at once.	J.D., I've got your back. Laverne, bolus with amiodarone, get me the crash cart, grab me a central line kit, I'll bag him. Run the fluids wide open.	I call these "train wreck codes," and they're not my forte.	Okay, just gimme a second, all right?

See, my problem is that I've just never been much of a multi-tasker. For instance, I can't eat and watch T.V. Or drive my scooter and answer my phone.	Okay, he's stable.	Toto!T-O-T-O Toto.	14 Across: Four letters, "Band that sang 'Roseanna'"?

Now, let's apply the same thing to Mrs. Kasuba. We know this isn't the first time she's experienced abdominal pain. What else do we know about her?	Wow.	It's the classic Todd Thong Sugar Trap.	If you're looking for sugar, there's some on the floor.Thonnnnnnng!
Yeah, I got this.	Oh, you know what, J.D.? Um, I've gotta run. Are you okay here?	Now, let's apply the same thing to Mrs. Kasuba. We know this isn't the first time she's experienced abdominal pain. What else do we know about her?	Wow.

There it is. Laverne, I'm gonna need you to get Mrs. Kasuba started on IV dextrose and hemotin.	"Dr. Cox at my door, pager 324."	Acute intermittent porphyria! I figured it out! All right, who's got Dr. Cox's pager number?Oh, who'm I kidding, I've got my Perry's Pager Song.	I think it, and she does it!
She what?	Dr. Reid already ordered that.	There it is. Laverne, I'm gonna need you to get Mrs. Kasuba started on IV dextrose and hemotin.	"Dr. Cox at my door, pager 324."

Whether it's catching a glimpse of what the future might hold....	All right now, before we start, just in case my wife asks and she probably will what did this guy do to get his foot cut off?	There are a lot of things that can knock a guy on his ass.	She figured it out before me.

Eh! As soon as I step foot in this hospital, I'm all business.Good morning, Dr. Cox! From the world's most giant doctor!Well, that was outside the hospital. Plus, Elliot was the legs. Sure, she's skinny, but she's thick through the trunk.	Probably during one of those countless times you were goofing off?	I don't get it. When did she become a better doctor than me?	I know. And your guilty anguish is it's delicious. It's like a little mini-meal between lunch and dinner. Quite frankly, it's all I can do not to grind pepper on your head.
Those aren't real guns.	You're finally at that stage where you and your equally undistinguished colleagues have all had enough training to be able to help each other. So no matter how humiliating it may seem, if you know somebody who's better than you and I'm bettin' that you do? you had best tuck that ridiculously feminine tail of yours between your legs and go ask her for help. I'm thinkin' that's just about it. Yep. I, uh, gosh, I'm all out of speeches. I don't think I have, uh, another one on me. I...I don't. The Oh. These are...my goodbye guns.	Eh!

I just, I don't know what to do when everything goes wrong at once. It's it's it's overwhelming.	Just call first from now on!	And how come when we walked in you were sitting in a circle with three corpses playing Texas hold 'em?	He keeps it cold!
That's your big secret? Breathing?	You wanna know what my big secret is? Just take one big breath. Everything will slow down and you can just tackle each thing as it comes.	I just, I don't know what to do when everything goes wrong at once. It's it's it's overwhelming.	Just call first from now on!
It's just that you're a little smug.	Why do you have such a problem with me teaching you stuff?	That's your big secret? Breathing?	You wanna know what my big secret is? Just take one big breath. Everything will slow down and you can just tackle each thing as it comes.
Because you're the one that's supposed to struggle not me.	You called yourself Dr. Diagnosis and made me your side-kick. J.D., you've been the golden boy around here for the past three years while I have cried in closets and hid from Dr. Cox and relied on you every single day to get me through it. I mean, now that I am finally doing well enough to pay you back, maybe you can tell me why you're being such an unbelievable jerk?	It's just that you're a little smug.	Why do you have such a problem with me teaching you stuff?
Greetings! Ha ha! Ha ha! I'm the world's most, most giant doctor! Whoa!	I need you to place an IV on the second floor, room 208.	Oh, Elliot, that's impossible. I mean, I know you've got strong legs, and you're	Cheers!
Little help? Little help!	Oh!	Greetings! Ha ha! Ha ha! I'm the world's most, most giant doctor! Whoa!	I need you to place an IV on the second floor, room 208.

Oh, man, your ass indentation is so deep, it's like I'm sitting in a giant inner tube.	How do you like what I left you over there?	Mm-hmm.	I wasn't too excited about taking over this spot after you sat in it for twenty minutes, but I gotta tell ya, it's warm in all the right places.
Oh, why "alias"?	Oh, yeah, I got this, I snuck onto a plane, thought it was going to Belgium, ended up in Kenya. Long story short, I hung out with this tribe; when the males go through adolescence, they get this tattoo. It means "alias."	Ohh, no, man, we're just living together. And not like, like, livin' together, I mean, like, liiiivin' together!	How long're you two seeing each other? You're a great couple.
Do you have any sevens?Turk!You have lots of sevens!We tear it.	It's their favorite show.I'm only kiddin'. I don't know what it means.Enough about me.

You never know what life would put in your lap when you open your arms and embrace it!	Done it! Done that. That one I've done.	Lads! You're sleepin' off and you're dead and buried. You have to get out in the streets, you have to talk to a stranger. Drink a beer with breakfast! Take the ugliest girl home at the party!
Elliot!	Dude.	"You'll be surprised what'll fall in your lap if you open up and embrace life..."	Go travelin' to Texas, you know? Go line dancing with some married women that wish they weren't married. You never know what life would put in your lap when you open your arms and embrace it!
That happened very quickly.	He said my eyes look like the Irish countryside after a soft rain. Ahem. I should go.	Elliot!	Dude.
Dude.	Don't even sweat it. It's Elliot. She's desperate!	That happened very quickly.	He said my eyes look like the Irish countryside after a soft rain. Ahem. I should go.
The crazy thing is most assumptions could be avoided if you just asked a simple question in the first place.	I'm going in!	...Or assuming that a little girl from Connecticut would never fight dirty.	Whatever makes you happy, sweetie. See you at home.
He put a guy in the hospital; that's a felony. And as doctors we're supposed to report him.	I don't know, man, he seems cool.	No, dude, forget them. We have to deal with Billy. Now, should we call the cops on this guy or what?	Baby
No! This is a decision we both need to make! Together! As a team, as a unit!	Are you trying to convince me to do something that you already did? 'Cause you know that drives me crazy!	He put a guy in the hospital; that's a felony. And as doctors we're supposed to report him.	I don't know, man, he seems cool.
Thank God.	All right, fine, let's call the cops.	No! This is a decision we both need to make! Together! As a team, as a unit!	Are you trying to convince me to do something that you already did? 'Cause you know that drives me crazy!
"Turk"'s easier to hear over the phone.	Hello, gentlemen. We got a call about a felony from a Dr. Turk?	Thank God.	All right, fine, let's call the cops.
Well, he started it!	John Dorian, you are a doctor!	Aaaaaaaghgggghhhhhhh!Ohh, you think scaring people's funny, huh?! Well, good! Because you're dying!	BOO!
For Turk and I, it was important just to get out and start living life, period.	I almost peed!	Or renewing your friendships.	Hey, doc! Zip it, grip it, and snip it!
I know, but how often do we do this?	Buddy, it is almost one o'clock in the morning, and we have to be at work at five.	For Turk and I, it was important just to get out and start living life, period.	I almost peed!
Uh, no. Go fish, please.Do you have any Ks?	You're absolutely right, come on.Do you have any twos?	I know, but how often do we do this?	Buddy, it is almost one o'clock in the morning, and we have to be at work at five.
No, Carla, an African-American club.	Settle down, we're just going to a nightclub.	You guys, I am so excited about tonight.	Noooo! NO!
In Turk's defense, we had tried this once before.	Promise me you'll be cool.	No, Carla, an African-American club.	Settle down, we're just going to a nightclub.
And once before that.	You can't touch me.	In Turk's defense, we had tried this once before.	Promise me you'll be cool.
Yeeeeeaaaaah, booooooy!Man, it's only ten o'clock.	And once before that.	You can't touch me.	In Turk's defense, we had tried this once before.
But, hey, third time's the charm.	Yeeeeeaaaaah, booooooy!Man, it's only ten o'clock.	And once before that.	You can't touch me.

My God, look at those beautiful eyes. They're so big I can see myself in them. Wow, how cute am I!	This is so weird! I been looking for a doctor! See...	I'm a doctor. Uh, John Dorian. Most of my patients live.	Okay, time to move in for the kill. Work the fact that you're a doctor into the conversation. Just be subtle.
You got it! Come by Sacred Heart tomorrow, I have clinic hours. After all, I'm a doctor.	...so it's probably nothing big, but I'm wondering if you could check it out?	My God, look at those beautiful eyes. They're so big I can see myself in them. Wow, how cute am I!	This is so weird! I been looking for a doctor! See...
I gotta thank you for taking a special interest in this.	Dude, I can't believe this. You're gonna date a patient! I hope she has something that keeps her here for a while so you can get to know her.	You got it! Come by Sacred Heart tomorrow, I have clinic hours. After all, I'm a doctor.	...so it's probably nothing big, but I'm wondering if you could check it out?
My God, look at those beautiful eyes. They're so bi You're doing it again!	Remember, I said...	Ohh. How could I not have heard that?	No, I told you it was James.

That moth is crazy!Hey, I heard a great joke. A guy walks into a dentist's office and says, "I think I'm a moth." And the dentist says, "Well, if you think you're a moth, why are you at a dentist's office?"	Dude? A guy walks into a dentist's office and says, "I think I'm a moth." The dentist then says, "Well, if you think you're a moth, why'd you come to the dentist's office?" The guy then says, "Well, the light was on."	I got this: Baby, you know you're his world!	Mm-hmm.
...So the moth says..."That's a good question. What kind of dentist are you?" And the dentist says, "Well, I'm a general dentist, but I...I do dabble in orthodontry braces and such." And...and the moth says, "Orthodontry? I hear there's great money in that."	Oh, no, I forgot the punchline.... You can't bail out now! Stall! Stall!	That moth is crazy!Hey, I heard a great joke.

Do you ever have any, uh, shortness of breath? For instance when you're walking Kylie to the apartment that you share?	Time to go fishing for some info.	Okay, well, uh, let's get a little history on you.	Mm.
Window! Window!	We don't live together.	Do you ever have any, uh, shortness of breath? For instance when you're walking Kylie to the apartment that you share?	Time to go fishing for some info.
Uh-huh?	Dude, the only difference between a black girl and a white girl is that when a black girl asks you if her ass looks big?	They're okay. Is there some special way to get a black girl to like you?	How things going with Kylie?
All right!	You say, "Hell yeah!"	Uh-huh?	Dude, the only difference between a black girl and a white girl is that when a black girl asks you if her ass looks big?
Hell, yes!	Okay! You wanna play some ball?	All right!	You say, "Hell yeah!"
Yeah. I ally-ooped him.	Embarrassing for me, actually, see....	Oh, this, it's a little embarrassing. I was playing baske	What happened to your eye?
Well, we should probably get get you fixed up, or things might start falling off of ya.	Oh, no, we haven't slept together...yet. It's not like I'm missing out shoot, I probably got it from my secretary. Or that trainer from the gym. Ooh, or this fine chick, Tamyra, that bartends with Kylie? Yeah.	Thank you. Your test results, let's see what's going on.	Hell, no! Sweetie ain't drinking no cafeteria coffee! Sweetie, you are drinking the coffee from the doctors' lounge!Let's. Seton Hall, huh? That is...
Nothin'!	Hey! What are you guys talking about?	And what do you do when every fiber of your being wants to say something, but you know you can't?	Now, you have to keep this between us you know, doctor-patient confidentiality, right?
There may be a way around it....	Yes!	Yes there is!	Is...there an "A"?
Mm.	I just work at the club to pay for grad school.	You can bartend online?	Ugh, I shoulda brought my laptop I could've gotten so much work done.
I love politics! Ask me anything!	I'm getting my Masters in political science.	Mm.	I just work at the club to pay for grad school.
You can vote if you're under twenty-five?	Did you know only seventeen percent of people under the age of twenty-five voted last year?	What are you doing?! You don't know anything about politics! You're screwed unless she asks about Bush or the bald assistant president who has all those heart attacks!	I love politics! Ask me anything!
Would you like to play a game of Hangman?	I can't believe a cute guy like you doesn't have a girlfriend. If I was single, I'd totally snatch you up.	The only thing you can take solace in is that a girl like her would probably never be interested in you anyway.	You can vote if you're under twenty-five?
Sometimes you have to break the rules. And Elliot's patient waking up was a clear sign that you couldn't deny.	He sure did. And you know why? Because I broke the rules and ignored what Dr. Kelso wanted me to do.	Well, he woke up to a world of bad boyfriends, oaths, and gonorrhea.	I just did an exchange transfusion on my malaria patient in there, and he just woke up on from his coma.
Signs be damned! I'm telling her!	Mr. Chang is crashing!	Sometimes you have to break the rules. And Elliot's patient waking up was a clear sign that you couldn't deny.	He sure did. And you know why? Because I broke the rules and ignored what Dr. Kelso wanted me to do.
Who cares! I'd make more money bartending!	Dude! You can't tell her! They won't let you be a doctor anymore!	Kylie! Kylie!	Signs be damned! I'm telling her!
This is your moment! Grab it!	Hey! J.D.!	Hey, Kylie, there you are.	I get to have sex tonight!
And there it was. Great doctors don't break oaths.	I wanted to thank you for being such a great doctor.	This is your moment! Grab it!	Hey! J.D.!
Someone once said the bad guys always win. Sometimes the bad guy is a jerk boyfriend.	Thanks again. For everything.	And there it was. Great doctors don't break oaths.	I wanted to thank you for being such a great doctor.
Sometimes the bad guy is the man you've been battling with for as long as you can remember.	It's finally here! The long-awaited showdown between Shaq and Kobe!	Someone once said the bad guys always win. Sometimes the bad guy is a jerk boyfriend.	Thanks again. For everything.
Gonorrhea! I mean...gonorrhea.	My girlfriend Tamyra, from the club? She's also feeling a little sick, and you'll never guess what she has.	What are you doing here?	I guess all you can do is come back to work the next morning and hope that being a good guy pays off.
Your boyfriend is a jerk.	You could tell me now.	Gonorrhea! I mean...gonorrhea.	My girlfriend Tamyra, from the club? She's also feeling a little sick, and you'll never guess what she has.
What the hell was that?	Don't beat yourself up. I got a scrunchie.There!	It'll be awesome.Sorry about your hair.	The top won't go up.
It was Sophie's Choice. Either heartlessly leave the possum there to die or wrap that little guy up in my sports coat and reveal the short-sleeved nerd jersey that lurked beneath.	It's a poor little possum! We should take him to the vet!	What the hell was that?	Don't beat yourself up. I got a scrunchie.There!
I'll always remember him. Little Carlton.Anyway, we only lost about a half hour. We can still make that reservation!Oh, there's possums everywhere!	I think it's so sweet that you're depressed about that poor little possum.	A hundred and twenty dollars for a stupid dead rat!?	Yeah, this thing's dead. That'll be a hundred-twenty dollars.
Great!	No, no no no. It's just a box.A...talking box.I think your shirt stopped the bleeding.	I'll always remember him. Little Carlton.Anyway, we only lost about a half hour. We can still make that reservation!Oh, there's possums everywhere!	I think it's so sweet that you're depressed about that poor little possum.
The ex-girlfriend from hell.	Dr. Dorkian, I presume?	I think they sensed that my first date wasn't going perfectly; and even though I could smell face cake in the air, it was about to get worse.	Nurse? Do me a favor, please bandage this gentleman up, little bit...fix him up.
After the tour! What is it with you and the underpass?	Hey. Hey, hey! You were gonna take me back to the underpass!	Danni, love to stay and talk, but I'm giving Kylie here a tour of the I.C.U.	The ex-girlfriend from hell.
Good lord! That's a one-day mustache?	Are you doing this because I forgot to shave this morning?	Thanks for the shirt, Lonnie.	So what? You're the one wearing it.
Aggghhh! I just said "slaves" to my new black girlfriend!	No, Lonnie.It's so great, because the residents are practically our slaves.	Good lord! That's a one-day mustache?	Are you doing this because I forgot to shave this morning?
Well, let's see. "Fatigue, fever, malaise." Have you been to Hong Kong, sir?	Unfreeze, J.D. It's over.	Aggghhh! I just said "slaves" to my new black girlfriend!	No, Lonnie.It's so great, because the residents are practically our slaves.
And then I said something stupid.	Yeah...?	Well, let's see. "Fatigue, fever, malaise." Have you been to Hong Kong, sir?	Unfreeze, J.D. It's over.
I forgot that if any doctor suspects SARS, it's cause for immediate quarantine lockdown.	Could be SARS.	And then I said something stupid.	Yeah...?
Say no more. Lonnie, shirt!	I don't know. I think it's kind of exciting...being in a hospital, getting to see you in action. I just wish I could be your assistant.	So be honest is this the worst first date you've ever been on or what?	Yeah you did!
Don't make me say pants. I'll do it.Still tanning, I see.	No!	Say no more. Lonnie, shirt!	I don't know. I think it's kind of exciting...being in a hospital, getting to see you in action. I just wish I could be your assistant.
Yeah.	He's your bitch, isn't he?	Don't make me say pants. I'll do it.Still tanning, I see.	No!
You look ridiculous.	Lonnie! Chart!	Well, you need a chart.	So what first, doctor?
Elliot, I need another doctor over here, stat!	Get it!	I don't have it!	Fifty bucks or I tell the girl.
Gimme thirty dollars.	Yeah?	Elliot, I need another doctor over here, stat!	Get it!
I need a dermatologist over here, stat!	I gave you twenty, I'm tapped!	Gimme thirty dollars.	Yeah?
Look, I paid this guy to fake a heart attack. He wants fifty bucks, we only have twenty.	Oh yeah! Time to shine!	I need a dermatologist over here, stat!	I gave you twenty, I'm tapped!
You have a trust fund! Now gimme the money!	You know, I feel like you guys just use me for my money.	Look, I paid this guy to fake a heart attack. He wants fifty bucks, we only have twenty.	Oh yeah! Time to shine!
CLEAR!	Ehhh!	You have a trust fund! Now gimme the money!	You know, I feel like you guys just use me for my money.
J.D., one Lord, zero.	I'm alive!	CLEAR!	Ehhh!
Here it comes sexy!	You know something? Seeing you in your element today, you seem so...	I could hear the pain in my best friend's voice, and I could feel how little I cared...because by the way Kylie was looking at me, I knew she thought I was sexy.	NOOOOOOOOOOOO!
She would have said sexy if I had a mustache.	Genuine.	Here it comes sexy!	You know something? Seeing you in your element today, you seem so...
Cool.	You know, James lied all the time, and I don't know...it's just nice to be with a guy I can trust.	She would have said sexy if I had a mustache.	Genuine.
I certainly would never sleep with her.	And the lies begin again.	I barely know her.	Ugh! That's exactly the kind of girl my ex-boyfriend would have dated.
That's it you're stronger than this. Not another lie!	I certainly would never sleep with her.	And the lies begin again.	I barely know her.
I race motorcycles.Excuse me.What the hell are you doing?	That's it you're stronger than this. Not another lie!	I certainly would never sleep with her.	And the lies begin again.
For what?	I need more cash.	I race motorcycles.Excuse me.What the hell are you doing?	That's it you're stronger than this. Not another lie!
Fine! But know this: you've been nothing but a disappointment to me since the moment I ran over you.	I'm puttin' DSL in my box.	For what?	I need more cash.
Kylie, wait.	Let's go.	Dr. Kelso made me realize that lies come back to haunt you even little ones about cake.Heck, even a lie of omission shook the foundation of a couple that was much more established than Kylie and me.And I knew I couldn't let her go out that door.	Double or nothin'!We're even. Good night, sir.
If I don't come clean now, whether it's a few weeks or months or years from now, I know it's gonna come back to haunt me and ruin us, and I don't want that.	Why are you telling me this?	I had sex with her. A lot.	Adios, assface.
Yeah.... I understand. It's....	I'm not looking for a project.	If I don't come clean now, whether it's a few weeks or months or years from now, I know it's gonna come back to haunt me and ruin us, and I don't want that.	Why are you telling me this?
Wait. You know, if we if we leave like that, that's how we're always gonna remember this night. I don't want that.	So get it together.	Yeah.... I understand. It's....	I'm not looking for a project.
Hi.	Hi.	YES! Ten to nine!	AHHH! DO YOU SEE WHAT YOU GET, CARLA!? DO YOU SEE WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU MESS WITH THE WARRIOR!?!
Bye.Ahh. Kylie's in class all day and she bartends at night, and I'm still working sixteen-hour shifts, so we try to make sure we kiss at least once a day. Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, she takes a cab over here; Tuesdays and Thursdays, I scooter to my baby!	Bye.	Hi.	Hi.
Just. Stay. Calm.	Yeah, that's me.	Okay, then, Mr. James, you're free Wait a second, Charles James? I was watching the 'Cheers' DVD the other night are you Charles James the writer?	No.
This is very important! He may even need a surgical consult.	J.D., don't leave me here.	Uh, Elliot, I need to take this gentleman upstairs for some more, uh, tests.	Just. Stay. Calm.
Oh, well, that's understandable	No.	Really?	Wow.... I've never actually met anyone who had the same name as a character on the show.
I mean, there's a lot of Sams....	Yeah.	Oh, well, that's understandable	No.
Am I wrong, Elliot, or is that the kind of cough that needs a chest x-ray?	Oh, a couple of months now.	Mr. James, how long have you had that cough?	I want you to go in there and tell Mr. James that there's absolutely no reason for him to be up here.
Thank you.	Probably.	Am I wrong, Elliot, or is that the kind of cough that needs a chest x-ray?	Oh, a couple of months now.
...or having to do someone else's dirty work for them...	We couldn't even make it one day.	It was strange telling Mr. James he may only have a few weeks to live when just a few short hours ago we all thought he was fine....or realizing your relationship may not be as stable as you thought...	Uh, Mr. James, I'm not quite sure how to say this, but...you have lung cancer...
...there are moments when we all wish life was more like a sitcom.	Say, Kenny? Can I talk to you for a second?	...or having to do someone else's dirty work for them...	We couldn't even make it one day.
I'm sorry, too, sir.	I'm so sorry.	...there are moments when we all wish life was more like a sitcom.	Say, Kenny? Can I talk to you for a second?
J.D.'s sitcom fantasy will be back after these messages!	Well, the good news is I won't have to eat my wife's cooking anymore, right!	I'm sorry, too, sir.	I'm so sorry.
It's floating wicker propelled by fire!Besides, I defy you to find one other thing that I'm afraid of!	Oh, my God. You're afraid of balloon rides, aren't you!	Safety is always important, Elliot.	What's he gonna do? Bruise one of his giant malignant tumors?
Is that my new sweater?!	Mopping time! Mopping time! It's mopping time!Yes, it's mopping time, my friend! And as you know, I always like to start in the exact spot you're standing. Let's get to work.Here we go.	It's floating wicker propelled by fire!Besides, I defy you to find one other thing that I'm afraid of!	Oh, my God. You're afraid of balloon rides, aren't you!
It went dynamite with my beige cords!	No, this is my new sweater mop.	Is that my new sweater?!	Mopping time! Mopping time! It's mopping time!Yes, it's mopping time, my friend! And as you know, I always like to start in the exact spot you're standing. Let's get to work.Here we go.
And who cares about him! He's anti-Semitic!	Wait a second! This chart isn't for Charles James, it's for James Charles! He's the one who has cancer, not you!	Well, I hope you had a good day, Mr. James!	And by "good time" she means bumping uglies!
Hey everybody!Thanks for coming so quickly.You know, this is the kind of thing I normally say out loud in my head, but since we're all here...It just seems like, in the end, everything always works out. Because as long as we	Well, that's a load off my mind!	And who cares about him! He's anti-Semitic!	Wait a second! This chart isn't for Charles James, it's for James Charles! He's the one who has cancer, not you!
Wait, this isn't right.	Mr. James? Mr. James, can you hear me?	Hey everybody!Thanks for coming so quickly.You know, this is the kind of thing I normally say out loud in my head, but since we're all here...It just seems like, in the end, everything always works out. Because as long as we	Well, that's a load off my mind!
Unfortunately, around here things don't always end as neat and tidy as they do in sitcoms.Relationships aren't always magically fixed in thirty minutes you have to work on them.Problems don't always have easy solutions.	We're gonna intubate!dopamine! Wide open! I need an ET tube. Where's anesthesia?	Wait, this isn't right.	Mr. James? Mr. James, can you hear me?
Step Two: Sashay her into sympathy.	I am so pooped.	The dance begins with a subtle hint.	As I felt the onslaught of what can only be described as a vicious tongue cramp, I decided it was time to let Kylie see my favorite dance. The "For God's sake, invite me to stay over" dance.
It's chilly out there.	Step Two: Sashay her into sympathy.	I am so pooped.	The dance begins with a subtle hint.
Finally, sweep her off her feet with your vulnerable cuteness.	It is cold.	It's chilly out there.	Step Two: Sashay her into sympathy.
Tip the band leader and fluff up the pillows, because this dance is done.	You know what I call this weather? Snuggle weather.	Finally, sweep her off her feet with your vulnerable cuteness.	It is cold.
What? Is this about the bra catapult thing? Because if it's that big a deal, I can throw my own water balloons. I don't need those C-cups.	You have to move out.	I wasn't the only one having relationship trouble.	Yeah, hit the bricks, bitch. You got no game! Ha ha ha ha ha!
She called me a man!	Come on, Bambi. Aren't there any other married couples that want to live in a small apartment with a 29-year-old man?	Carla, I totally understand you guys need your space, but with work and my financial situation, finding a new place is gonna be, minimum, two to four years.	All right, Carla calls the shots. Appeal to her rational side.
I banged your first girlfriend.	It was my idea.	Turk, I've always had your back and you always had mine. Are you sure you want to go through with this?	She called me a man!
Now, look, I need a favor. Let me try it. I'll move out for a week; if you still like it, I'll move out for good.All right. And d-d-d-don't worry about John Dorian, because I may be poor in pocket, but I'm rich in friends!	Chantal?	I banged your first girlfriend.	It was my idea.
That's okay, because when God closes a window, he opens a door.	Nope.	Now, look, I need a favor. Let me try it. I'll move out for a week; if you still like it, I'll move out for good.All right. And d-d-d-don't worry about John Dorian, because I may be poor in pocket, but I'm rich in friends!	Chantal?
Kylie, I hear you. But trust me, this week is not gonna be about sex. Even though I think we both agree that's where we'd eventually like our relationship to end up, right?	I'm just not sure I'm comfortable with you sleeping here.	That's okay, because when God closes a window, he opens a door.	Nope.
Extra-medium.	No problem.	Oh, I don't I don't have one of those, Todd.	Oh, I don't swim.
I clubbed it with a Mag-Lite.	What happened?	Hey, guys! The heater's broken again.	Baby, no. We're too proud. We are the proud Turks.
Suit yourself.	I did a triple bypass yesterday. I think I could fix the heater.	I could probably stay and fix it. It could take three, four, five days.	I clubbed it with a Mag-Lite.
I don't think so, buddy.	So I hear you're homeless. I wanna volunteer, give you a place to stay.	Suit yourself.	I did a triple bypass yesterday. I think I could fix the heater.
You're gonna slather jam on my face and sic a family of raccoons on me, aren't you!	Listen, crash in my garage. I guarantee you there will not be another person in there.	I don't think so, buddy.	So I hear you're homeless. I wanna volunteer, give you a place to stay.
I'm out.	Damn it. I've become predictable.	You're gonna slather jam on my face and sic a family of raccoons on me, aren't you!	Listen, crash in my garage. I guarantee you there will not be another person in there.
Options?! I got cable TV and a dead dog! I got plenty of options!	Oh, yeah? Well, from what I hear I'm your last option.	I'm out.	Damn it. I've become predictable.
Yeah.	The pathologist?	Does Doug Murphy live here?	Yeah?
Okay.... But, Mr. McMahon, would you mind	No. He moved out.	Yeah.	The pathologist?
You are correct, sir!	Hi-ohhhhhhhhhhh!	Okay.... But, Mr. McMahon, would you mind	No. He moved out.
Come on, you two are interracial best buddies. I, too, have a black best friend. Go out, enjoy it! Celebrate your uniqueness! I can do it!	Newbie, I've got this one covered.	Who needs a baby-sitter? I'll do it! You don't even have to pay me in cash, just pay me in hot showers. And you don't have to, like, wash me unless you want to, but that could be weird. I don't know.	Oh, bring it on, daddy.
Well, Turk lets me call him Brown Bear.	I'm sorry. Did you just call me black? Because the last time I checked, the correct term was "African-American."	Come on, you two are interracial best buddies. I, too, have a black best friend. Go out, enjoy it! Celebrate your uniqueness! I can do it!	Newbie, I've got this one covered.
I should go.	Who the hell is Turk?!	Well, Turk lets me call him Brown Bear.	I'm sorry. Did you just call me black? Because the last time I checked, the correct term was "African-American."
I don't want to come home. It took me a month to get here from the couch.	J.D.!	I couldn't have planned it better.	You don't have to crash on the couch.Well, Dr. Dorian, are you gonna join me?
Get the moment back! Say something hot!	Uh, J.D., maybe you should go home.	I don't want to come home. It took me a month to get here from the couch.	J.D.!
It's always nice to let your friends know that you appreciate them.	I'm home!You guys moved couch?	At first I was a little disappointed that I wasn't sleeping at Kylie's, but it was good to be home.	That's just not gonna happen. No way.
I missed you, my African-American friend.	I'm glad you're home, buddy.	It's always nice to let your friends know that you appreciate them.	I'm home!You guys moved couch?
Brown Bear.	Call me Brown Bear.	I missed you, my African-American friend.	I'm glad you're home, buddy.
But sometimes you just can't quite find words to show that appreciation.	This, uh...is a classmate of mine from medical school. He's located up in your area now. I think he'd really be able to help you.	Brown Bear.	Call me Brown Bear.
At the end of the day, the best thing to do for your friends is to be honest.	The laundry, the fixing the radiator, the listening to me gossip and playing stupid games with Turk. How do you make yourself do all that stuff?	What do you mean?	So, Bambi, what's the deal with all the things you do around here?
You just have to hope that your honesty doesn't make them realize something they didn't wanna know.	I don't know, I never really thought about it. I guess when you care about someone, you'll do whatever you can to make 'em happy.	At the end of the day, the best thing to do for your friends is to be honest.

The Todd forgot to breathe again. Starting CPR.	The surgeon lives!	*We all held our breath together.*	Okay, I'm done.
*Turk and Carla were having relationship troubles so she'd been staying at Elliot's for a few days.* You were late the last time.	I've got time.	That is the most ridiculous hat I've ever seen. *And I must have it.*	Hey dude, check out what I found when I was taking out the trash!

Yeah, but last week I set it back three hours so we could see what it felt like to live in Honolulu.	Yeah, but I set the clock ahead an hour last night so I wouldn't be late.

Oh really, Turk, was it a thick bush? Because there's berries in my ass! Just go!	That was a thick bush!	You got it, player! Hold on buddy!	Oh my God, dude, I've got to be downtown in like eight minutes!Dude, we're never going to make it in time! Take the shortcut through that hedge!
Don't worry, Turk, I got 'em!	Sorry. My bad, dude, my bad.	Oh really, Turk, was it a thick bush? Because there's berries in my ass! Just go!	That was a thick bush!
Yeah he did, because he wasn't listening. Napkin on your lap, Satan's Valet. Thank you.	Warlord... burn mouth.	I wish I knew how it was going. Sorry about your hogs, fellas. Enjoy the free espressos. Warlord, I told you to sip it. Use your words.	My head hurts.
My head hurts.	I did. But apparently if I'm the one she didn't know she could trust, how's she supposed to trust she can trust me telling her she can trust me?	Just tell her she can trust you.	Dude, she's got this whole trust issue with me.
No way, dude. It's never smart to get in the middle of someone else's relationship.	Yeah, mine did too. That's why I need you to go in.	My head hurts.	I did. But apparently if I'm the one she didn't know she could trust, how's she supposed to trust she can trust me telling her she can trust me?
Hey! Wanna grab a beer?	I'll let you wear my top hat.	No way, dude. It's never smart to get in the middle of someone else's relationship.	Yeah, mine did too. That's why I need you to go in.
But I told Turk I'd talk about him constantly until you made me leave.	J.D., I know what you're trying to do and it's very sweet, but the last couple of days have been so messed up and confusing, I'd love to just try and forget about it and have a few drinks, okay?	No, but I can tell you who doesn't sing it. Billy Joel, who brought us such hits as "Uptown Girl" and "Matter of Trust". And speaking of trust, do you know who's really trustworthy? Turk. I call him Turkey Turkey Turkey Turkey Trust Trust. A little nickname.	Oh, it's so nice to get out. Oh, hey do you know who sings this song?
Two appletinis, guv'ner!	I'll let you put the hat back on.	But I told Turk I'd talk about him constantly until you made me leave.	J.D., I know what you're trying to do and it's very sweet, but the last couple of days have been so messed up and confusing, I'd love to just try and forget about it and have a few drinks, okay?
Carla, I'm not as think as you drunk I am. I mean...	J.D., you're drunk!	Because you can see Elliot's whole apartment from up here.	J.D., why are we sitting up here?
I can let go of the couch, if I so choose.	Then why can't you let go of the couch?	Carla, I'm not as think as you drunk I am. I mean...	J.D., you're drunk!
*There are many things we can't control, no matter how strong we might be. Like a kneejerk reaction.*	Okay, let go of the couch. Let go! You see?	I can let go of the couch, if I so choose.	Then why can't you let go of the couch?
Right.	Nothing happened.	You're welcome. *And sometimes, you let go of the control you do have in a brief moment of weakness.* Sorry. Drunken accident.	Thank you, for helping me have some fun tonight.
Good night.	Good night.	Right.	Nothing happened.
Good night.	Good night.	Good night.	Good night.
Buenas... those things.	Buenas noches.	Good night.	Good night.
*Like she said, everything's fine.**There's nothing like the rays of the morning sun kissing you awake and gently reminding you that you got drunk and kissed your best friend's wife.* Oh my God!	Good night.	Buenas... those things.	Buenas noches.
Yeah, but it was nothing!	Oh my God. So it really happened?	*Like she said, everything's fine.**There's nothing like the rays of the morning sun kissing you awake and gently reminding you that you got drunk and kissed your best friend's wife.* Oh my God!	Good night.
No! There wasn't even any tongue!	Nothing!	Yeah, but it was nothing!	Oh my God. So it really happened?
It was just a friend kiss!	No tongue!	No! There wasn't even any tongue!	Nothing!
No, I pursed them like this.	Were your lips parted at all?	It was just a friend kiss!	No tongue!
Yes it is! It's a friend kiss and we will never talk about this to anyone ever!	I don't know, J.D. I remember my one lip being on top of your upper lip and my other lip being somewhere in the middle of yours, which means your lips were apart and I don't think that's a friend kiss.	No, I pursed them like this.	Were your lips parted at all?
Nothing.	What's going on?	Yes it is! It's a friend kiss and we will never talk about this to anyone ever!	I don't know, J.D. I remember my one lip being on top of your upper lip and my other lip being somewhere in the middle of yours, which means your lips were apart and I don't think that's a friend kiss.
Carla!	J.D. and I kissed.	Nothing.	What's going on?
Yes!	You kissed? Like a friend kiss?	Carla!	J.D. and I kissed.
Carla! You're killing me!	No!	Yes!	You kissed? Like a friend kiss?
Ted, what are you doing?	A little help!	I had to hide from Turk, so I went to the one place that I knew no one would ever venture. Ted? Ted?	Hello? Did someone come in?
Ted, lunch was four hours ago.	I like to do stomach crunches after lunch.	Ted, what are you doing?	A little help!
It's Wednesday.	Yep, I wasted most of my Tuesday.	Ted, lunch was four hours ago.	I like to do stomach crunches after lunch.
No, because this is two degrees worse. I can't breathe, it's like you're all over me. I'm trapped in a death coffin.	Don't you mean third degree?	Whoa! What's with the fifth degree?	There you are. Hey Ted. So how'd it go last night?
*Alright, he knows your lying face, but silence is incriminating too. So think. What's between silence and talking?*	Calm down, I just want to see if you got anywhere with Carla.	No, because this is two degrees worse. I can't breathe, it's like you're all over me. I'm trapped in a death coffin.	Don't you mean third degree?
Thanks for saving my ass.	I know my own body.	Ted, you should probably sit down. You're looking a little purple.	I owe you one.
I guess I'm glad we kissed then.	Well, I wasn't saving your ass. I didn't realize how easy it is to make little mistakes. They're stupid little mistakes that seem like nothing but can snowball on you and take your whole marriage with it, you know? I feel like I really understand now how Turk could have let stuff like that happen, you know? So I forgave him.	Thanks for saving my ass.	I know my own body.
*Or a patient trusting his doctor to help him hold on to his dignity.*	Hey Jack! Just blink when you want me to get you down. Just give me the old blink-a-rooney. Terrific athlete. I'm thinking 2016 Olympics. Oh God, was that a blink? Excuse me.	*Even if it involves a compromise.*	You bet your sweet ass she did.
*It may take a lot of work, but it's worth it.*Wow, that was a moist kiss. Wish I was wearing an apron.	Yeah! And then I pulled off Grandma's breathing apparatus. No, I'm serious!	*Or a patient trusting his doctor to help him hold on to his dignity.*	Hey Jack! Just blink when you want me to get you down. Just give me the old blink-a-rooney. Terrific athlete.

Sports time!	*It may take a lot of work, but it's worth it.*Wow, that was a moist kiss. Wish I was wearing an apron.	Yeah! And then I pulled off Grandma's breathing apparatus. No, I'm serious!

Floor Wax.	AARRGGHH!	And of course, the one thing you can always count on to knock you on your ass...	Ma'am??? You just ma'amed your way out of me ever buying you beer again!Ma'am?
I miss the silence.	You kissed my wife.	When we got to work, not a whole lot had changed. The silence was killing me...	Reeeaaaly? Show me happy...Sad...Silly...Amused, bemused, c-mused...Show me angry.AARRGGHH!!Got angry down.
Well that's kind of a trick question, Turk. I mean if I say yes, it's like I'm saying "damn dude, your wife is hot & I'd like to get me some of that". But if I say no then I'm all like "yo, I know she's your wife but you can keep that fish-lipped bitty".	Did you like it?	I miss the silence.	You kissed my wife.
Sitting .	WHOOAAA! Don't even look at her. Sit on the floor.	It was barely even a kiss dude; it was like an accidental lip bump, like oops.	Turk, look, I'm so sorry but you have to believe me. It was barely anything.
Who gets a tattoo of a mop? Can I get up, my butt is asleep.	This'll just take a second.Nice, huh?	Hey we're kind of in the middle of something here!	Now you don't have to put it on today, but...
Well I don't know, you just look so cute in your little blue outfit; I wanted to give you a tickle.	What's that?	Whatever. You got something here though.	He didn't stop. Stop! This hallway is closed; you have to find another way around.
Hey.	Hey guys.	It's nice when things get back to normal.	Atta girl.Barbie! Feel free to kiss my ring.
You got it.	Put some ketchup on it.	Carla, you gotta try these sweet potato fries, they're amazing!	Hey.
Don't worry, this'll all be fine. You know Turk, I mean, whomever he blames will get the silent treatment for a couple of days, then he'll make snarky comments for a few months and then, sooner or later, he'll be laughing about the whole thing. It's just like the time I slept with his family's cleaning lady.	I'm sorry. The only way I'm gonna have closure here is if I can blame one of you guys. I just gotta figure out who.	No Turk, it's understandable.	No.
I was staying in their guest-room & she was buffing the nightstand and she just kept on buffing. But hey, thanks for taking the hit on this one.	You slept with Tuni?	Don't worry, this'll all be fine.

Oh but all you have to do is have sex with him & he'll forgive you. If I have sex with him he'll probably end up madder.	Me? Na-a na-a, you're his best friend, all you have to do is say "I'm sorry", high-five him & go "DAAAAHHHHH!"	I was staying in their guest-room & she was buffing the nightstand and she just kept on buffing. But hey, thanks for taking the hit on this one.	You slept with Tuni?
Agreed.Dude she was pouring drinks into me & she knows I put out when I'm drunk.	You know what; let's not play into his blame game.	Oh but all you have to do is have sex with him & he'll forgive you. If I have sex with him he'll probably end up madder.	Me? Na-a na-a, you're his best friend, all you have to do is say "I'm sorry", high-five him & go "DAAAAHHHHH!"
DAAAAHHHHH!	He took me to a bar.	Agreed.Dude she was pouring drinks into me & she knows I put out when I'm drunk.	You know what; let's not play into his blame game.
I'm telling you dude, she was all over me. Like ants on candy.	I didn't ask him to walk me home.	DAAAAHHHHH!	He took me to a bar.
After sharing a quick victory dance with Roland, the heavy-set orderly who, coincidentally, was my victory dance coach...	I got 3 words for you; sucks to be, adding a fourth, you .	Be gracious.	The silent treatment.
OK, there it is. Thanks Roland, one day I'll get it.	Pop the hips, pop the hips J.D.	After sharing a quick victory dance with Roland, the heavy-set orderly who, coincidentally, was my victory dance coach...	I got 3 words for you; sucks to be, adding a fourth, you .
I got to thinking about relationships, about how people fall in love...Have kids...Grow old together...And say goodbye...And then for some reason I thought about the circus... but then I was back on relationships...	I doubt it.	OK, there it is. Thanks Roland, one day I'll get it.	Pop the hips, pop the hips J.D.
And I couldn't help thinking that maybe it wasn't luck that made relationships last. Maybe it was just a matter of who takes fewer hits...	Back to your room Mr. Johnson, you've got one ventricle!

And I realized I should have been the one to take that hit, not Carla.	You don't have to talk to me, just wave if you're gonna give me a ride home.	And I couldn't help thinking that maybe it wasn't luck that made relationships last. Maybe it was just a matter of who takes fewer hits...	Back to your room Mr. Johnson, you've got one ventricle!
I know but I told her my name was Turk. Look the point is, think of the millions of times you chose to not to hang out with your wife, 'cause you were trying to hang out with me. You know, maybe it's time you started acting like a real husband, instead of acting like some sort of crazy... cowboy.	That wasn't me that was you!	Dude, who do you think you're talking to, you think you've been the World's greatest husband? Please, I was there when you were flirting with your ex-girlfriend & neglected to tell her you were married. I was there when you tried to hook up with that waitress, the day before you got engaged. And I was definitely there when you hooked up with that nasty ass stripper at "Boobies, Boobies, Boobies".	Aw man, I'm going home.
I don't know, it just came to me.You know I'm right Turk.	A cowboy?	I know but I told her my name was Turk. Look the point is, think of the millions of times you chose to not to hang out with your wife, 'cause you were trying to hang out with me.

Sometimes sacrifice is only wearing your new uni when you're not at work...	Hey!Look here, I was thinking maybe, maybe you'd rather just stay in tonight. You know have some pizza watch, watch some movies, what do you say?Are you trying to smile?You're so damned cute.	A lot of times, the answer is about sacrifice...	How is it that no man understands that every woman, whether she's 16 or 60, still has that awkward, insecure, self-conscious teenage girl inside of her?
Other times, it's about swallowing that damn pride...	OK how about this one? Three blue-jays fly into a bar & they say, "we just want to wet out beaks". Ha, ha, ha... no? Sorry Dan, you tell one.	Sometimes sacrifice is only wearing your new uni when you're not at work...	Hey!Look here, I was thinking maybe, maybe you'd rather just stay in tonight.

But ultimately, big or small, sacrifice is about doing something you don't really wanna do.	J.D., would you hand me the wine please? Turk's not talking to me.	Other times, it's about swallowing that damn pride...	OK how about this one? Three blue-jays fly into a bar & they say, "we just want to wet out beaks". Ha, ha, ha... no? Sorry Dan, you tell one.
Man, you guys need your space.	Really?	Hey guys, I know we talked about this before but, I'm moving out.	But ultimately, big or small, sacrifice is about doing something you don't really wanna do.
You're gonna miss me though.	Wow, thanks man.	Man, you guys need your space.	Really?
As much as Hooch loved us, it was even better to see Turk happy. See, he and Carla had recently started couples therapy, and I'm not sure he was enjoying it.	Hooch is crazy!	Oh, Hooch!	Everyone hates you guys.
Agh! ...Peace, homey!	Okay, I'll see you around.	Thankfully, Turk had gotten over the whole kissing incident. Still, there's a weird new thing he does whenever he says goodbye.	Okay.
Oh, don't worry about her, Betty, you're in good hands with Dr. Dorian.	Is Dr. Reid coming back?	So Elliot, the first thing we're gonna need to do is....	So, uh, Betty, I'll check on you the second I get back, okay? You get better, now!
That's me! Betty, Dr. Dorian. 'Cocoon'. Wilford Brimley. Steve Guttenberg. The whole day. No?	Who's that?	Oh, don't worry about her, Betty, you're in good hands with Dr. Dorian.	Is Dr. Reid coming back?
There you go, Betty! That's every cotton ball in the hospital!	"As comfortable as possible." I've said that a million times and I still have no idea what it means.	Well, we could put you on a breathing machine, but it's unlikely you'd ever come off of it. Or I could just make sure you're as comfortable as possible.	So...what are my choices?
Then you're ready to die.Look, Betty, is there anyone you'd like to talk this over with?She just wants to talk to you for a minute.	Ohhh! I am very, very comfortable!	There you go, Betty! That's every cotton ball in the hospital!	"As comfortable as possible." I've said that a million times and I still have no idea what it means.
Just about how and when she should die.	Yeah? About what?	Then you're ready to die.Look, Betty, is there anyone you'd like to talk this over with?She just wants to talk to you for a minute.	Ohhh! I am very, very comfortable!
Look, this woman is alone, she's depressed, and for some reason she feels like she's connected with you.	Oh, that's not a problem. I counsel most of my random neighbors on their deathbeds.	Just about how and when she should die.	Yeah? About what?
That's great! Keep it light! Open with a joke, and before you know it you and your raft will be on a four-hour trip to New Zealand!	Look, I'm sorry, but I wouldn't know what to say.	Look, this woman is alone, she's depressed, and for some reason she feels like she's connected with you.	Oh, that's not a problem. I counsel most of my random neighbors on their deathbeds.
Oh no. You're dangerously close to revealing that geography is your Achilles heel. Say something smart to regain credibility.	No, it's more like fourteen hours.	That's great! Keep it light! Open with a joke, and before you know it you and your raft will be on a four-hour trip to New Zealand!	Look, I'm sorry, but I wouldn't know what to say.
You can dance your way there from Old Zealand.	Trust you? You don't even know where New Zealand is.	Vasovagal syncope is mediated by the autonomic nervous system. And Betty needs you, pal. She does! Come on, do it. You'll feel good, trust me.	Oh no. You're dangerously close to revealing that geography is your Achilles heel. Say something smart to regain credibility.
Gotta look at the Adam's apple, buddy.	Nuh-uh.	She's a dude.	So that girl's kinda cute, what's her story?
Really? Oh, okay. I'll see you later. Bye.Ow! You see!	I'm not upset!	Well, I think that's true. I mean, if you look at the whole Carla kissing thing, I think intellectually you moved on, but emotionally you're still upset. You'll get there, though, pal.	So check this out: Our therapist says I'm the type of guy who pretends everything's okay even when I'm upset deep down inside.
Let's try it again. I'll see you later, buddy. Bye!	See what?	Really? Oh, okay. I'll see you later. Bye.Ow! You see!	I'm not upset!
OW! Always the same spot! It's like your fingers are stone!	Bye.	Let's try it again. I'll see you later, buddy. Bye!	See what?
No way!	Oh, pretty good. Pretty good. We, uh, we talked about her past. Betty even let me in on a few of her romantic trysts from her younger days you familiar with Mr. David Brinkley?	Yeah, you're like the brown Hulk.Hey. How's it going in here, you two?	I've been hitting you.
Wha?	What?	Dr. John Dorian.	Of course, he wouldn't've been able to do it if it weren't for his secret weapon...
No I didn't, Jake.	You just said your name in a weird kinda summing-up way.	Wha?	What?
See, that's summing up in a weird way.	Ah, so you're Jake! Uh, as I understand it, you just talked my sister into ending her life. Long story short: I'm a lawyer, I'm suing you. Once again: Sister dying, brother lawyer, suing you!	No I didn't, Jake.	You just said your name in a weird kinda summing-up way.
"Brother lawyer." That's it.	Yeah.	See, that's summing up in a weird way.	Ah, so you're Jake! Uh, as I understand it, you just talked my sister into ending her life. Long story short: I'm a lawyer, I'm suing you. Once again: Sister dying, brother lawyer, suing you!
"Buy Groceries. Kill Self."	He spelled "attorney" wrong.	Go take a nap, Ted.	I don't get real cards until I win a case.
I am not from the future, Jake!Yes! It finally worked! What are the odds?	Just admit it you're just here from the future to destroy me.	"Buy Groceries. Kill Self."	He spelled "attorney" wrong.
Who's Greg Barton?	I don't know what the odds are, J.D., but what I do know is I'm about to go down to my truck, get my kayak paddle, and go Greg Barton on your ass.	I am not from the future, Jake!Yes! It finally worked! What are the odds?	Just admit it you're just here from the future to destroy me.
Oh, Greg Barton!	He's a famous kayaker.	Who's Greg Barton?	I don't know what the odds are, J.D., but what I do know is I'm about to go down to my truck, get my kayak paddle, and go Greg Barton on your ass.
I know.	I hate you, J.D.	Oh, Greg Barton!	He's a famous kayaker.
Kelso had a point. I mean, in the outside world you'll occasionally see a stream of cars drive by an old woman with a flat tire. But around here, every time you round a corner, well...	I didn't say it wasn't funny; I just said it happened. Come on, when's the last time you saw a glimpse of humanity in this place.	Sir, you laughed and pointed when she fell.	Son, look around. There's an old man with Alzheimer's who no one bothers to come visit. This morning I had a chat with a woman who refuses to stop using cocaine even though she's six months pregnant. And just last week I saw an older woman fall and break her hip because some guy was too busy to hold the door open for her!
...Anyway, I knew what I had to do.	She fell again.	Kelso had a point. I mean, in the outside world you'll occasionally see a stream of cars drive by an old woman with a flat tire. But around here, every time you round a corner, well...	I didn't say it wasn't funny; I just said it happened. Come on, when's the last time you saw a glimpse of humanity in this place.
Oh. Well go, anyway, wherever it is you're rafting.	You've been brushing up on New England.	Just go, Jake! No one here knows your last name if anything happens, he'll never be able to find you. Go enjoy your little rafting thing in New Zealand which, incidentally, is ten thousand miles east of Australia, and famous for alcoholism and clam chowder. I've been brushing up on my New Zealand.	...Anyway, I knew what I had to do.
He just left!	Where's he going?	Oh. Well go, anyway, wherever it is you're rafting.	You've been brushing up on New England.
And another man realized it's okay to be a decent human being for once.	Just make her as comfortable as possible.	One man was pushed to make the right decision.	Yeah.
And don't you forget who put that tire on and tightened those lugnuts, Martha! Okay, sweetie, have fun at the swap-meet! Drive safe.	I can't believe that six young men stopped to help an old lady change a tire!	As for me, seeing Jake come back and do the right thing restored my faith in humanity.	Oh, congratulations, Clarissa!
Righty loosey, lefty tighty.	Yep. It sure feels good to do the right thing.	And don't you forget who put that tire on and tightened those lugnuts, Martha! Okay, sweetie, have fun at the swap-meet! Drive safe.	I can't believe that six young men stopped to help an old lady change a tire!
Oh, "righty tighty! lefty loosey!" Ohhhh, man. It still feels good.	Righty loosey, lefty tighty.	Yep. It sure feels good to do the right thing.	And don't you forget who put that tire on and tightened those lugnuts, Martha! Okay, sweetie, have fun at the swap-meet! Drive safe.
I'm just kidding. We'll have some sent right to your room, big guy.	What?	Jello-O is for winners.	Can I get some Jell-O, please?
Dude, you're not gonna believe how much trouble I'm having finding a place to live.	Thank you.	I'm just kidding. We'll have some sent right to your room, big guy.	What?
Good guy.	I got this round. Be right back.	Well, I could use a beer.	Unfortunately for Jake, he still had to pass muster with Turk and me. And nothing is quite as daunting as our "good guy test."
Yeah.	Great guy.	Good guy.	I got this round. Be right back.
Excellent choice.	Oh, my God!	Yeah.	Great guy.
Her on top, eyes closed, yelling, "Don't look at me! Don't look at me!"	Which is?	Oh, please, you're a half a glass of wine away from nuding up and doing your go-to move.	You are a weird and angry man!Look, I have just been thinking about all of my relationships, and every time one has potential, I go too fast and ruin everything. Long story short, Jake's not getting any.
So it's important to have a plan to deal with it. Even if it means never being alone with someone.	Well, the guy started choking, so naturally I sprung into action and gave him an emergency trach.Yeah.	There are certain people in life who know how to push your buttons.	So what did happen at the taco stand?
Mmm. Doesn't Kathleen Turner have dynamite nerps?	Wow, this 'Body Heats a sexy movie, huh?	So it's important to have a plan to deal with it. Even if it means never being alone with someone.	Well, the guy started choking, so naturally I sprung into action and gave him an emergency trach.Yeah.
Of course, if that person is stubborn, there's not much you can do.	Yeah.	Mmm. Doesn't Kathleen Turner have dynamite nerps?	Wow, this 'Body Heats a sexy movie, huh?
I never gave you any references!	All your references checked out.	This is so awkward. Look away. Look away!	Just came back to get my keys.
So when we go to pick teams, I'm gonna hit that shot. Then you say, "I'll take that guy!" At which point, Carla is gonna page me . And I'll say, "Crap, I gotta go." And you go, "Damn! We just lost the best player out here!" Then there'll be eight guys in the hospital who think I'm good at sports, and word will spread.	Ah-huh?	Okay, so here's what's gonna happen: I finally mastered my running hook-shot, okay?	Ah.
Between these thoughts.	When do you find time to see your patients?	So when we go to pick teams, I'm gonna hit that shot. Then you say, "I'll take that guy!" At which point, Carla is gonna page me . And I'll say, "Crap, I gotta go." And you go, "Damn! We just lost the best player out here!" Then there'll be eight guys in the hospital who think I'm good at sports, and word will spread.	Ah-huh?
Elliot's boyfriend, Jake, had given her confidence to do things she'd never been able to do before.	Oh. Okay. Let's play some ball!I got that guy.	Between these thoughts.	When do you find time to see your patients?
Yeah.	Wow.	Oh, thanks SCB! By the way, I should tell you something: I found an apartment, I'm moving out the day after tomorrow.	Your hook-shot knocked you unconscious, so I lied down next to you so everyone would just think we were chillin'.
"Super Chocolate Bear."	What does "SCB" mean?	Yeah.	Wow.
I knew you would.	I love it.	"Super Chocolate Bear."	What does "SCB" mean?
I know your name, Jake, I'm being condescending.	Yeah, it's	Uhh, Jake...is it?	So you took a fall-back job because you were afraid to go for it?
Guilty.	You know how you're prone to overly sensitive girly displays of sentimentality?	Yeah, but we won't be able to stay up 'til six in the morning planning anything as genius as the soup shower! This is the end of an era, Super Choc.	Why? We'll still be able to pull pranks on him after you move out.
Oh! Can we cut words out of magazines that represent how we feel about each other and glue them into a "Friends Forever" collage?	Okay, now, if you reel it back a little bit, I'll get somebody to cover for me tonight, and I'll help you pack your stuff.	Guilty.	You know how you're prone to overly sensitive girly displays of sentimentality?
Oh. Well, can we drink beers and reminisce?	Hell no.	Oh! Can we cut words out of magazines that represent how we feel about each other and glue them into a "Friends Forever" collage?	Okay, now, if you reel it back a little bit, I'll get somebody to cover for me tonight, and I'll help you pack your stuff.
That's all I wanted to do anyway.	Hell yes!	Oh. Well, can we drink beers and reminisce?	Hell no.
No, I didn't know.	Now, listen to me. You gotta make tonight count. 'Cause you'll never be as cool as you were when you were rollin' with The Big Dog as your roommate, you know?	Plus, I already made the collage.	That's all I wanted to do anyway.
I replaced your ass!	Hooch!? J.D., what the hell is going on here!?	Hello there, Chocolate Bear Two.	By who?
Okay, but Turk's a prideful guy, and it's hard for prideful guys to admit when they've been insensitive.	Carla, I can sense you're upset. Talk to me.	Maybe I was being unfair to Turk. Maybe it's too much to expect a friend to just sense that you're upset and wanna talk about it.	Make-it-stop five?
Touché, magic hallway.	Listen, Jordan, I've been incredibly insensitive.	Okay, but Turk's a prideful guy, and it's hard for prideful guys to admit when they've been insensitive.	Carla, I can sense you're upset. Talk to me.
Hooch is crazy....So, Hooch, this is it.	No, it's me Hooch, Vanilla Bear! Heh heh!	Turk!	Touché, magic hallway.
Wait, where's Rowdy?There he is!THERE HE IS!	Then things took a turn.	Hooch is crazy....So, Hooch, this is it.	No, it's me Hooch, Vanilla Bear! Heh heh!
Well, say things'll be the same.	J.D., you're just moving out.	Look, before, when you said I'd never be as cool as when I was living with you, you know there's some truth to that. I'm sorta like odd and geeky, and you've always sort of...validated me.	How is that girly?
Mmkay.	That's Carla and I gotta go.	Well, say things'll be the same.	J.D., you're just moving out.
Really?	I dunno. I think it's 'cause this time, I wasn't trying to mess with you.	Why are you so obsessed with this!?	No better pick-me-up than a slice of Mom's pie!
Who would do this to themselves?	Really.Huh?	Really?	I dunno. I think it's 'cause this time, I wasn't trying to mess with you.
As every piece of food I'd put into my body in the last year was rushing out of me, it got me thinking. The way some things never change shines a light on the things that do.Like when a new person comes into the hospital to stay...	Totally worth it.	Who would do this to themselves?	Really.Huh?
Then again....	Agh!	And so here I am a guy in an empty apartment with a dead dog. Oh, and that's not a tear on my cheek, that's just from the leak in my ceiling. And, yes, change is scary, but it's also inevitable. It's up to you to make the best of it. I mean, it's not like opportunity is just gonna fall in to your lap.	I know you're feeling abandoned right now, but we just went through a really rough spot, and I'm not the type of guy to make life-changing decisions without thinking about it for at least, like...a few months.Let's make a baby.
This didn't feel like my scooter.	Hey! You took my Porsche from the valet?	Yep, life was pretty different.	My bad, baby.
I didn't care, because now that I'm and attending, I had picked out a whole new look.	Ow! Look, no harm done. Here's your driving glasses, here's your driving scarf, and here are you driving gloves.Fine, here's your driving sock.	This didn't feel like my scooter.	Hey! You took my Porsche from the valet?
Morning, colleague!	I didn't care, because now that I'm and attending, I had picked out a whole new look.	Ow! Look, no harm done. Here's your driving glasses, here's your driving scarf, and here are you driving gloves.Fine, here's your driving sock.	This didn't feel like my scooter.
Ooh, what, tall, dark and scary? I can wear whatever the hell I What are you doing?	Oh, absolutely not.	Morning, colleague!	I didn't care, because now that I'm and attending, I had picked out a whole new look.
Ow.Whoooaaaaahhhh! OK, you know, I'm gonna I'm gonna go with 'ow.'	It'll happen.	I had a little trouble getting my Baby Gap t-shirt off.	...seven, eight, nine and ten.
Born without lips.	How depressing is it being you? I mean seriously, would you equate it more with being a lifelong Cub fan or to, say, being born without lips?	Ow.Whoooaaaaahhhh! OK, you know, I'm gonna I'm gonna go with 'ow.'	It'll happen.
How sad.	I know a guy. His house just burned down.	Born without lips.	How depressing is it being you? I mean seriously, would you equate it more with being a lifelong Cub fan or to, say, being born without lips?
Listen, today, if you bother me, could you do it without being around me? Because I have new interns starting today. Can you imagine what it's like to see this place through their eyes for the first time?	Well, he was smoking in bed. He shouldn't have smoked. Because he looked ridiculous.I have a snake face.	How sad.	I know a guy. His house just burned down.
Oh, you guys can skedaddle.	Newbie! If you loved the sound of your very own voice any more, you'd probably just sit in a little room all day and sing to yourself.	Well, that's probably why you're here! Ha! Humor is a great ice-breaker for patients, OK? Follow me. Mr. Kellerman has congestive heart failure. OK, Lisa, I want you to start him on diuretics, OK? That way we'll loosen up some of the fluid around his lungs. The good news is, he'll go home tomorrow. Bad news is if he's not here he won't move up on the heart transplant list. See, in medicine there are lots of Catch 22's, a phrase made famous, I believe, by an old fisherman, who would stay out fishing until he caught how many fish? Anybody? That's right, 22. See, in 1492, Columbus	Oh, not great.
Thanks, Dr. Kelso! You know he said half-sincere, but I think he was full-sincere. Feel my shoulder, it's still warm.	Now there's an answer that warrants a half-sincere pat on the shoulder.	I turned in my paperwork already, but I'm gonna wait till tomorrow to turn in my urine sample out of respect for the fellows in the lab. There's an asparagus issue.	Perry, your lips, my ass, they should meet. Dorian, after four years, I can only hope that you are no longer following in his footsteps.
Yes we are.	Lindsay, by you reaching the level of attending physician, you've somehow managed to become a member of club that *I* belong to. Obviously, there was no vote, because if there had been, you would still hear the sound of my voice screaming, "Nay! Nay! Oh, dear God, one thousand times nay!" That being said, it's my obligation to let you in on the organization's one and only bylaw: We're men.	Thanks, Dr. Kelso! You know he said half-sincere, but I think he was full-sincere. Feel my shoulder, it's still warm.	Now there's an answer that warrants a half-sincere pat on the shoulder.
I don't need your approval, or your stupid man cards! Although the lettering is darling, have you ever done calligraphy?	The women are men, the children are men, the men of course...*men.* So, I went ahead and took the liberty of making you five man cards.Hold them very dear because every time you drop the ball "manwise," I'm going to take one from you.

Afterwards, we talked about my living arrangements.	One, please.	That night, since we were low on cash, Turk snuck me into the movies.	Damn it!
Carla was pretty psyched to get rid of me. Are you gonna tell her?	You shouldn't stay in a hotel, so why don't you just stay here until you find a place?	Are you sure about this?	Afterwards, we talked about my living arrangements.
W-w-w-wait! Could you quickly scratch my nose? Ah. Ooh. Okay. Okay.Don't zip me up. NO! Turk! Turk! Whoa, Whooooaaa!	Look. I gotta sex her up. I'll be back as quick as I can. So I'll be 'bout an hour and half.	Turk, you left your gym shorts in here!	Mm, OK.
Well maybe a hundred wasn't enough, I don't know!	And maybe someone already apologized for that about a hundred times.	Maybe someone or something had to gnaw a hole in it to keep from suffocating.	Oh, babe, I borrowed your backpack this morning and all my change fell out the bottom.
Damn it!	Absolutely no lover's quarrels!	Well maybe a hundred wasn't enough, I don't know!	And maybe someone already apologized for that about a hundred times.
Hey Keith! Can I get your pudding?	Mmmmm.	The Turks are sneaky.Not you guys, I think Omar took my pudding.	How did this conversation become about me?
Interns.	Uh...Eh..	Hey Keith! Can I get your pudding?	Mmmmm.
I'm sorry, Mr. Larson, but I do not like the look of that leg.We would have better hours. All right, gang, get out of here. Hey, everybody? Great work today.	There's so much paperwork. My dad was a veterinarian and he never had to do any. Sometimes I wish this place were more like a horse hospital.	That's my pudding, Omar!Huh. This guy's unbelievable.OK, guys, for some reason Mr. Kellerman's fluid situation isn't getting any better. I think we should be more aggressive. Keith? Why don't you go get a Lasix drip.Other way, Keith!Uh, Jason, when you're filling out a female patient's exam report, her breasts can be healthy or unhealthy. Never "bangin' double-D's."	That'll end well. Dude!
OK, you've been working on your Turk impression since college. Time to shine!	Turk? I'm leaving for work.	Being Turk's secret roommate was going great. Until now.	Perfect.
Baby I'll be thinking about your lovelies and whatnot until the second I see you. But right now, I'm doin' my business.	Turk?	OK, you've been working on your Turk impression since college. Time to shine!	Turk? I'm leaving for work.
Well, you better get ready. She's been off the pill for like a week.What have you done?	Nah, she came back for a quickie. All this baby stuff, man, I feel like she rushed me into it. To tell you the truth I'm not even sure I'm ready.	I thought she was gone.	Dude! That's the best that's ever sounded!
There's a lot of ways to get caught.Sometimes you get caught because you couldn't slip your wife her pill last night, so you had to feed her one of your special, homemade brownies.	Who told you guys to do this?	They're messing up on purpose?	Dr. Dorian? If he gets bad enough that we have to put him on inotropes, he'll jump to the top of the transplant list and then he'll get a new heart.
Damn it.	Angie, my buddy down in the lab just told me that your urinalysis came back positive for...the birth control pill. So. I will be taking one of these. Thank you!	As for me, I caught my culprit because he made the classic mistake of returning to the scene of the crime. And all because I, too, had been eating Turk's special, homemade brownies.	Come on, guys. Who put you up to this?
You know what I've been doing? I mean, besides listening to my Alanis Morissette CD to get me pumped up to talk to you? Here.	Thank you.	Hey!	Way too familiar.
I've been thinking about how completely ridiculous it is that you would take Mr. Kellerman's life into your hands without talking to him.	Yup.	You know what I've been doing? I mean, besides listening to my Alanis Morissette CD to get me pumped up to talk to you? Here.	Thank you.
Allow me to thank you for giving me the opportunity to prove myself. You know what? This is my last one, here.Take it! Whatever happens to this poor guy is on you.s Narration: The next morning was not good. Carla was not talking to Turk. Elliot had dropped by to help not talk to Turk, and I was sneaking out in my undies because my clothes were downstairs in the dryer.	Because you're an attending now. And that doesn't just mean a fat bank account, expensive new toys and a fancy lawyer on retainer for when you kill a prostitute. From now on, the buck stops with you, and I know that you have occasionally bent the rules in this dump over the last couple of years, but you only did it because you knew when the crap started raining down it was damn sure gonna fall on my head. But now, the only way for you to stay out of the trouble storm is for you to go by the book and I've got news for you on that front. By-the-book attendings kill us up here. Newbie, I couldn't tell you about Kellerman because I don't know what type of attending you're going to be.	Then why didn't you tell me?	Patients who stay low on the heart transplant list die waiting for one. This way he moves up to the top of the list. Come on!
Morning, friends! Who's ready for some java?	J.D.?	Allow me to thank you for giving me the opportunity to prove myself. You know what? This is my last one, here.Take it!

Yes, I am, Carla, because I know when Turk's sad, he likes me to come over in my boxers because he likes to call me his honky Adonis, and that's what friends do.	Are you wearing boxers?	Morning, friends! Who's ready for some java?	J.D.?
Oh, it's my new driving sock.You can borrow.	What's that?	They bought it? Are we that gay?	Yes, I am, Carla, because I know when Turk's sad, he likes me to come over in my boxers because he likes to call me his honky Adonis, and that's what friends do.
Turk, why?	Actually, J.D.'s been living here secretly.	Oh, it's my new driving sock.You can borrow.	What's that?
J.D. didn't want to live here, I begged him.	Because I gotta get those damn judgmental eyes off me!	Turk, why?	Actually, J.D.'s been living here secretly.
What?	Dr. Dorian, I've kept my mouth shut about all the recent sexual harassment complaints because I don't think it's fair to punish a man for making small talk, or say, asking his secretary just once to dress up as a geisha girl and call him Kelso-san.	He's my patient, Bob. I'm responsible.	Well, Bobbo, I was going to treat him, but I lost my stethoscope...
I guess so.	Nothing. But now I need to know: is this the type of attending you're going to be?	What?	Dr. Dorian, I've kept my mouth shut about all the recent sexual harassment complaints because I don't think it's fair to punish a man for making small talk, or say, asking his secretary just once to dress up as a geisha girl and call him Kelso-san.
I could tell him there's nothing in my cup and I'm just pretending to drink to seem non-chalant...	Anything else?	I guess so.	Nothing. But now I need to know: is this the type of attending you're going to be?
But instead, I was thinking about what Carla said about moving on. And I wasn't the only one.	No.	I could tell him there's nothing in my cup and I'm just pretending to drink to seem non-chalant...	Anything else?
Wow. Want a hug?	I'm gonna go ahead and give you back one of these man cards. You deserve it.	Thanks for nothing, assface.	Newbie, I heard your voice.
I'm gonna have a good year, aren't I?	You held onto it as long as you could, didn't you?	Wow. Want a hug?	I'm gonna go ahead and give you back one of these man cards. You deserve it.
And I knew he was right.	Anything can happen.	I'm gonna have a good year, aren't I?	You held onto it as long as you could, didn't you?
AARGH!	Excuse me.	And I knew he was right.	Anything can happen.
Wasn't that your nickname in high school? Hello! Huh, huh, huh, huh.	A small one-pump mocha?	So what did you want me to get you?	Wahh! Dude! Oh God! Waahuh! NOOOO! Dude!
It was worth it!	Dude, there's a guy upstairs waiting to have his spleen removed.	Wasn't that your nickname in high school? Hello! Huh, huh, huh, huh.	A small one-pump mocha?
There it is! All right, kick some ass today, guys.Except for Mr. Woodson in 302, he's got that rectal tear.	First, do no harm!	Hippocratic Oath on three! One! Two! Three!	I hate you, Charlie.
We even spent this weekend building a house for the homeless.	You seem to be developing quite the rapport with your interns.	There it is! All right, kick some ass today, guys.Except for Mr. Woodson in 302, he's got that rectal tear.	First, do no harm!
Nice!In my defense, who wears a tie to a construction site?	How'd that go?	We even spent this weekend building a house for the homeless.	You seem to be developing quite the rapport with your interns.
I'm an attending!	I beg your pardon.	Sir, I'd love to chat, but it's already eight. I gotta rock and roll.	Son, when you're an intern you get treated like crap and when you're in a position of power, you do the same thing to them. It's inevitable. Like the tide. Or the awkward toast I'm going to have to give someday at my son's big, gay wedding. Mark my words, eventually you'll treat them like dirt like the rest of us do.
Got the ketchup.	I had to skedaddle, because today was burger day in the cafe and that meant one thing: 75 hungry employees and one bottle of ketchup.	Huh, huh, huh. Any-who, have a good one, Lurch.	Wasn't that your nickname in high school? Huh, huh, huh, huh.
Mmmm. That's headed right to our joint colon.	Mmmm.	Here it is.	You mean multi-ethnic Siamese doctor? Bite, please!
So tell me something, Carla, has she invited you to her new hospital?	Yeah, I think I've made my point.	Mmmm. That's headed right to our joint colon.	Mmmm.
Victory sip!	Hmmmm?	So tell me something, Carla, has she invited you to her new hospital?	Yeah, I think I've made my point.
Have you been following me around all day dressed like an intern?	Not funny.	OK, gang I'll meet you up in radiology to talk about Mr. Heath's CAT scan. His tumor's getting so big it's starting to look like a three-mor.	Oh! Must be your birthday.
Whatever. If it wasn't funny, why did they all laugh?	Yes, and you're a terrible teacher. I'm not prepared to operate on anyone.	Have you been following me around all day dressed like an intern?	Not funny.
Keith, I hope you die a violent death and bugs eat your corpse.	Well, we've been kind of fake laughing.	We'll catch her up later. Have you guys been fake laughing at my jokes? Be honest. I promise, absolutely no ramifications.	Coming!
Unbelievable. From now on, there 's absolutely no laughing at my jokes unless they're particularly hysterical! Talk about your mission impossibles, huh, huh, huh, huh.	Look! Your jokes kinda suck and when I laugh, you pick me to do procedures.	Keith, I hope you die a violent death and bugs eat your corpse.	Well, we've been kind of fake laughing.
What is it with you and the costumes today?	Case closed.	Unbelievable. From now on, there 's absolutely no laughing at my jokes unless they're particularly hysterical! Talk about your mission impossibles, huh, huh, huh, huh.	Look! Your jokes kinda suck and when I laugh, you pick me to do procedures.
No! See your death.	Really?	This is a little trust exercise that I really think is gonna connect us again. Remove your blindfolds, please.See your death, see your death, see your death...Keith...Don't worry, buddy. We're cool.	Then move your big, bald, biscuit head! Some of us don't have cable.
Hey! Why don't guys go upstairs and do some work!And for God's sake, will somebody wake up Gloria?OK, enough waving. You wave too much. You abuse waving. Go!	No! But I looked up to you!	No! See your death.	Really?
Gloria.	There it is, just like I said. I can feel your hatred like a cool spring breeze. Ah!	Hey! Why don't guys go upstairs and do some work!And for God's sake, will somebody wake up Gloria?OK, enough waving. You wave too much. You abuse waving. Go!	No! But I looked up to you!
That's what she said! Zoom, zoom, zoom!	Get off my back, I'm not in the mood?	OK, say it again!	Get off my back, I'm not in the mood. Whoa!
You know what? Put our right hand in front of your face. Now talk to it!	He's mad because they're sucking up to him and I was saying, "Dude, that's the exact same thing you did with Dr. Cox."	We were gonna do "multi-ethnic Siamese doctor has a Fresca," but then Turk started getting on my case about my interns.	Well...
No, you guys are fine. You're doing a good job.	Did we do something wrong Dr. Dorian?	I think it's always easier to be a jerk than a good guy.	Cute.
You know what? I want the laughter back!And you know what, I liked it when you waved, you were always waving...Why don't all of you just wave? All right.	Still, good guy or not, there's no reason why you shouldn't enjoy the perks.	No, you guys are fine. You're doing a good job.	Did we do something wrong Dr. Dorian?
Ultimately, you can deal with anything, as long as you have a group of friends around to go through it all with you.	You know what? I want the laughter back!And you know what, I liked it when you waved, you were always waving...Why don't all of you just wave? All right.	Still, good guy or not, there's no reason why you shouldn't enjoy the perks.	No, you guys are fine. You're doing a good job.
I can't imagine what it would be like if I were all on my own.	Hey, guys. What's going on?	Ultimately, you can deal with anything, as long as you have a group of friends around to go through it all with you.	You know what? I want the laughter back!And you know what, I liked it when you waved, you were always waving...Why don't all of you just wave? All right.
I I hurt her and I'm not very proud.	We have a very complicated past.	Whoa, hold your horses.	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa and whoa...
You know, relationships and things of that nature.	We've managed to restore our friendship by staying away from dangerous topics.	I'm a little proud.	I I hurt her and I'm not very proud.
Love the superficial. Dynamite teeth today.	J.D. and I keep it superficial.	You know, relationships and things of that nature.	We've managed to restore our friendship by staying away from dangerous topics.
Sparkly!	Oh, thanks, buddy!	Love the superficial. Dynamite teeth today.	J.D. and I keep it superficial.
Friday's my birthday! I've already e-vited everyone over to our place.	Friday.	Friday?	Fine, you can't live with Elliot, but you're not living with us, so get your crap out by Friday.
Your place. Look I can't just un-e-vite everyone, I've already gotten two e-yeses and twenty-four e-maybes. That's a lot of e-sponses.	Whose place?	Friday's my birthday! I've already e-vited everyone over to our place.	Friday.
It's a Mexican-themed fiesta on the first anniversary of my 29th birthday. That means I'm turning 30. Donde? 56 Walnut Drive. Cuando? Thank you for asking. Ocho-thirty until upside-down question mark. Sombreros at the door. Arrrrrrrrrooo!	Bambi, I'm gonna put my e-foot up your ass.	Your place. Look I can't just un-e-vite everyone, I've already gotten two e-yeses and twenty-four e-maybes. That's a lot of e-sponses.	Whose place?
Gracias, amigo. I borrowed one of your dictionaries.	I'll be there.	It's a Mexican-themed fiesta on the first anniversary of my 29th birthday. That means I'm turning 30. Donde? 56 Walnut Drive. Cuando? Thank you for asking. Ocho-thirty until upside-down question mark. Sombreros at the door. Arrrrrrrrrooo!	Bambi, I'm gonna put my e-foot up your ass.
Where did all of these unsupervised children come from?	Thirty? What's thirty?	I know, but who cares? I got all the time in the world. I mean I'm only turning thirty.	Things to do by thirty: Get married, buy a house, learn the difference between "Senator" and "Congressman." Dude, you haven't done any of these yet.
I've done nothing. I mean I did learn another language, but it was just that one where you slid a "b" sound in the middle of every single word, and I was never fluent.	First of all, don't lump me in with you, because I'm a surgeon, I'm married, I've had sex while playing Frogger and I'm gonna be a dad. I'm moving through my list.	I'm afraid of dragonflies. You know what, I'm not gonna make a big deal out of this. Neither one of us has made any headway with our lists.	Dude, you haven't done anything on this list. How could you never have slept naked on a hammock?
No-b-t with the la-b-di-b-es...	That secret language was so lame.	I've done nothing. I mean I did learn another language, but it was just that one where you slid a "b" sound in the middle of every single word, and I was never fluent.	First of all, don't lump me in with you, because I'm a surgeon, I'm married, I've had sex while playing Frogger and I'm gonna be a dad. I'm moving through my list.
Doug, I told you to stop pre-tagging patients.	Oh, we didn't, his vitals are fine.	When did we lose Mr. Heath?	OK.
You wrote a time of death.	It's a slow day in the morgue, nothing's written in stone.	Doug, I told you to stop pre-tagging patients.	Oh, we didn't, his vitals are fine.
Get out of here!	I wrote one-ish.	You wrote a time of death.	It's a slow day in the morgue, nothing's written in stone.
Carla, at 6:41 tomorrow evening I turn thirty. I have to find one thing on this list I can do by then.	Why are you so pissy?	Get out of here!	I wrote one-ish.
Haven't you used that joke like, a trillion times?	Maybe you could swing by our parts department and pick up a pair of testes.	Carla, at 6:41 tomorrow evening I turn thirty. I have to find one thing on this list I can do by then.	Why are you so pissy?
Well, I didn't know anything about cereal-inventing either, Carla. And yet if it wasn't for a harshly-worded cease and desist letter, we'd all be eating J.D.'s Bananas and Nuts.	Oh, you don't know anything about triathlons!	That's it! I'll do the triathlon!	Ignoring him...and switch!
Why is everybody wearing wetsuits?	You're not serious about this, are you?	Well, I didn't know anything about cereal-inventing either, Carla. And yet if it wasn't for a harshly-worded cease and desist letter, we'd all be eating J.D.'s Bananas and Nuts.	Oh, you don't know anything about triathlons!
Well, my bike is rusty, I haven't been able to feel my genitals since they first touched water, and the only thing I've had to eat all day is half a jellyfish. Why are you here?	How's it going?	As I reached the biking stage and finally realized what chafing was, I got a surprise visitor.	I'm about to ruin my career by plunging a knife into a completely conscious person! But you know what? You're absolutely right. Let's focus on the lying.
That's a dangerous topic, talk to Carla.	Can I talk to you about Jake?	Well, my bike is rusty, I haven't been able to feel my genitals since they first touched water, and the only thing I've had to eat all day is half a jellyfish. Why are you here?	How's it going?
Agh! It's like pedaling in hummus!	Why don't you just try a higher gear?	Talking to you violates the two most important tenets of our relationship. One, keep discussions superficial and two, no talking while my boys are straddling chrome. That one's new.	Dinner!
Oh, thank God, I think the bike part is finally over. Oh no.	See you, buddy!	Agh! It's like pedaling in hummus!	Why don't you just try a higher gear?
Oh, you're real. Although the dolphin costume is a little odd.	Hey, J.D.	They already finished and cooked a pig?	See you at the luau!
Elliot, you know our rules.	This Jake thing is still really bothering me.	Oh, you're real. Although the dolphin costume is a little odd.	Hey, J.D.
This is working.	Yeah, I've been thinking about that. Who wants to have a superficial friendship? And, God, do you remember how close we used to be? Dealing with Dr. Cox,	Elliot, you know our rules.	This Jake thing is still really bothering me.
Well, if he freaked you out, why don't you and talk to him?	Not for me, I want to be able to tell you that my boyfriend really freaked me out.	This is working.	Yeah, I've been thinking about that. Who wants to have a superficial friendship? And, God, do you remember how close we used to be? Dealing with Dr. Cox,
All right, fine, Elliot. You want to know why? You're just like me. You're scared because you feel like you haven't accomplished anything with your life. But instead of running a triathlon, you're pushing forward with a guy you don't belong with. And you know as well as I do that one of these days, he's going to open up a bottle of white wine for you when you really prefer red, except you never told him that and you want to know why? It's because he's not right for you, Elliot. Are you happy now?	I don't know. You tell me.	Well, if he freaked you out, why don't you and talk to him?	Not for me, I want to be able to tell you that my boyfriend really freaked me out.
Must. Finish. Race.	You're pretty smart for a guy running in bike shoes.	All right, fine, Elliot. You want to know why? You're just like me. You're scared because you feel like you haven't accomplished anything with your life. But instead of running a triathlon, you're pushing forward with a guy you don't belong with. And you know as well as I do that one of these days, he's going to open up a bottle of white wine for you when you really prefer red, except you never told him that and you want to know why? It's because he's not right for you, Elliot. Are you happy now?	I don't know. You tell me.
Oh, great. Then we'll be two losers under one roof.	Why don't you just move into my place?	Elliot, I'm thirty years old. I'm single, I'm homeless, and I'm pretty sure I just soiled myself.	J.D., what you said before, I knew you were right. Anyway, I'm sorry I got mad.Thanks. You were wrong about one thing, though. We are moving forward.
A wise man once said the human spirit can overcome any obstacle.	By my watch, you've got eight minutes to finish this thing. Come on!	Oh, great. Then we'll be two losers under one roof.	Why don't you just move into my place?
That man had obviously never run a triathlon.	Come on.	I can't...	A wise man once said the human spirit can overcome any obstacle.
Whoa!	Woo-hoo! We made it! And with two minutes to spare!	As for me, I could overcome any obstacle, as long as I had Elliot and her ridiculously strong thighs beneath me.	I think I see him.
Did it involve chains?	Nope.	Mm-hmm. Will you tell me what Jake's fantasy was?	Promise to help me get through my thirtieth?
Whips?	No.	Did it involve chains?	Nope.
Candle wax?	Mm-mm.	Whips?	No.
Role-playing?	No.	Candle wax?	Mm-mm.
Lasers?	No.	Role-playing?	No.
Nothing.	J.D., what are you doing?	I died, Turk-iot. Hellooo!	Hey dog, if you die before me, I'll let you play with my boobies while I finish.
Seeing an intern tell someone they're going to die for the first time is strange. Because even though it's a horrible and sad experience, if they get through it, there's a sense of accomplishment.	Check it out. Keith's telling Mr. Morrison about his brain tumor.	I miss having you as my roommate, I don't know!	Dude, what the hell are you doing?
Good job, man. What did you say?	Nailed it! Hell yeah!	Seeing an intern tell someone they're going to die for the first time is strange. Because even though it's a horrible and sad experience, if they get through it, there's a sense of accomplishment.	Check it out. Keith's telling Mr. Morrison about his brain tumor.
Ooh!	Well, I just told him that there's nothing more we can do right now.	Good job, man. What did you say?	Nailed it! Hell yeah!
"Nothing more we can do right now" implies that there maybe something we can do tomorrow.	What?	Ooh!	Well, I just told him that there's nothing more we can do right now.
Deadsies.	What was the middle one?	Yeah, I'm gonna need you to go back in there and use some form of the word "die." Dead, dying, deadsies, deadwood. Your choice.	That man knows he's doomed!
Did you know cowboys used to curse?	Deadwood?	Deadsies.	What was the middle one?
Unfortunately for you guys, I have the balance of a...	Same way we have for years.First one who falls introduces Kelso.	How do we handle this?	And, we're back. Anyway, I need one of you attendings to introduce me at the dinner, so figure it out.
Fine. Let's do this. Wheels up.OK, come on Dorian. Find your center. Round the rosy! Hey! I got it! I don't got it!Whoa. Whoa. Reel it in, Take it clockwise, fight your fear!Come on. Come on. Be the chair. You gotta want it Johnny D! You gotta want it! Woooooo!!	Careful, you're about to let Dr. Cox know you were a gymnast in high school.	Unfortunately for you guys, I have the balance of a...	Same way we have for years.First one who falls introduces Kelso.
Everyone has a human side, Coxy. Even Kelso.	You go do that, and I'll go find God, quit drinking, get in touch with myself emotionally and we'll meet right back here at half past impossible. OK?	I'll just say something nice about him that's actually true.	Look, if you get up there and start kissing Kelso's ass, your fellow attendings will forever think of you as a brown-nosing toadie. On the other hand, if you don't pucker up, Kelso will make your life a living hell. You're officially trapped.
You know, Laverne, I'm a doctor. So I'm not really gonna take my psychological evaluations from someone who dispenses them in between watching "Maury" and eating a corn muffin.	The hell he does. I remember a flu epidemic. He lost half a dozen children in one day. Hmm!The second Kelso's foot hits the bottom of those stairs, he doesn't have a care in the world.	Everyone has a human side, Coxy. Even Kelso.	You go do that, and I'll go find God, quit drinking, get in touch with myself emotionally and we'll meet right back here at half past impossible. OK?
Laverne, I...	OK, that was too mean. Apologize.	You know, Laverne, I'm a doctor. So I'm not really gonna take my psychological evaluations from someone who dispenses them in between watching "Maury" and eating a corn muffin.	The hell he does. I remember a flu epidemic. He lost half a dozen children in one day. Hmm!The second Kelso's foot hits the bottom of those stairs, he doesn't have a care in the world.
Ah, the hell with it. She's not gonna forgive you, go for broke!	Laverne, I...	OK, that was too mean. Apologize.	You know, Laverne, I'm a doctor. So I'm not really gonna take my psychological evaluations from someone who dispenses them in between watching "Maury" and eating a corn muffin.
I was watching CNN earlier. Apparently the terror alert in your armpits has been elevated to orange. Oh, no he didn't. Yes, Laverne, he did.	Ah, the hell with it. She's not gonna forgive you, go for broke!	Laverne, I...	OK, that was too mean. Apologize.
Well, I know a lot.	"Laverne, I'm a doctor." You're a bit of a know it all, aren't you?	I was watching CNN earlier. Apparently the terror alert in your armpits has been elevated to orange. Oh, no he didn't. Yes, Laverne, he did.	Ah, the hell with it. She's not gonna forgive you, go for broke!
Mark Felt, the F.B.I. guy. That's been all over the news for months.	Yeah? Who was Deep Throat?	Well, I know a lot.	"Laverne, I'm a doctor." You're a bit of a know it all, aren't you?
That's because there's no such thing.	Oh, sorry, rich boy. My TV doesn't get the news. Just the bible channel and some kind of Chinese boxing. I bet you don't know how to play Jiggly Ball.	Mark Felt, the F.B.I. guy. That's been all over the news for months.	Yeah? Who was Deep Throat?
I knew if I just followed Dr. Kelso around for a little while, he'd eventually do something decent. I'm a master of stealth. I could sneak up on anybody.	Ha ha! I knew you didn't know.	That's because there's no such thing.	Oh, sorry, rich boy. My TV doesn't get the news. Just the bible channel and some kind of Chinese boxing. I bet you don't know how to play Jiggly Ball.
Sir, aren't you being a little paranoid?	Why are you following me?	I knew if I just followed Dr. Kelso around for a little while, he'd eventually do something decent. I'm a master of stealth. I could sneak up on anybody.	Ha ha! I knew you didn't know.
When did you get an earring?	I was in Nam, you know. They pulled off my fingernails.	Sir, aren't you being a little paranoid?	Why are you following me?
I've got to get an earring.Turk, have you heard of Jiggly Ball?	Enid, I'm not cheating on you, this earring is mine.See?It's a hip-hop world, son. Keep up or get out of the way.	When did you get an earring?	I was in Nam, you know. They pulled off my fingernails.
I've heard of it, too. It's so awesome that we've both heard of it.	Yeah, it's a game the orderlies made up.	I've got to get an earring.Turk, have you heard of Jiggly Ball?	Enid, I'm not cheating on you, this earring is mine.See?It's a hip-hop world, son. Keep up or get out of the way.
So this is where germs are born...	Look, Lorraine, the sooner you let me have a look at that rash, the sooner we can get you back home...I mean, back on the street, which is your home. Hey, home street home, huh? I'm sorry, Lorraine, that was incredibly insensitive.Frick!	Finally, I had something I could say in my speech. Dr. Kelso was an angel.	Deal.
Turk knew I was joking.	J.D., you showed up drunk at my shower screaming through tears that I'd never be as emotionally connected to him as you are.	You knew she worked here? I can't believe you kept a secret. Remember before your wedding when you sold me out to Turk?	Elliot, sweetie, nobody but me can understand you.That's just Turk. You know that's how he is.
How do I not know about this game?	Look, I know this place isn't the greatest, but it's not like I lie awake thinking about being yelled at by Dr. Cox and playing Jiggly Ball with the orderlies.	It's more obvious to me, baby. I mean, Turk.	It's obvious you are.
Dr. Reid?	Who?	Can you believe Elliot's working at a free clinic?	This place is crushing my soul.
OK, keep going, I enjoy it, actually.Ah, I'm only two and a half years away from chest hands.	Buttery!	Job back.It's just a beautiful film. Beautiful. Corn?Oh, let me help you. I got it.You're tickling your hands. Wait, stop, you're tickling your hands.	J.D., I don't care if they're able to successfully attach one person's limbs on to another person's body, I am not giving you my hands.
See? These are chest hands.	I have to handle this on my own, OK?	OK, keep going, I enjoy it, actually.Ah, I'm only two and a half years away from chest hands.	Buttery!
Course, yours would be brown.	That's what I'm talking about.	See? These are chest hands.	I have to handle this on my own, OK?
Have you been to the Y on man night? Not me.	You could swim at the Y on Tuesdays. Men only.	Oh, I would never swim in a pond, they're infamous for serpents.	Fine, he's in a pond.
She's the idiot. We're doctors.	Oh my God! I would rather play Jiggly Ball than try to explain this to you two idiots.	Why do you have to go there?	Oh, so now a brother can't swim!
Do you remember earlier when I told you I'd never heard of Jiggly Ball? I was joking. I play all the time.	No, I'm busy cleaning.That one always kills.	Can I talk to you for a second?	It's not my job to care, Perry.
Get off.	I like this. It's an idiot handle.	Do you remember earlier when I told you I'd never heard of Jiggly Ball? I was joking. I play all the time.	No, I'm busy cleaning.That one always kills.
Just say no!	As it happens, we're heading out right now to play some Jiggly Ball. Are you in?	Get off.	I like this. It's an idiot handle.
Throw?	All right, you're gonna go first. Please enter the Jiggly circle.Everybody else, on my signal prepare to throw.	Jiggle me in.	Just say no!
Guys, why?	No.	Oh!There is no such thing as Jiggly Ball, is there?	I want you to think of this as a corn muffin.
AAH!!	YAAAAAHHHHH!!	I could see where it would be funny from the outside of the circle.	I got my shift covered!
Still, I also know that I wouldn't want to have to make any of the decisions that he makes.	I'd like everyone to welcome back Dr. Reid.	As far as Bob Kelso goes, I know some of the good things he does are for the wrong reasons.	Crap.
Even if he's too proud to show it.	But when all is said and done, I like to think he does care a little.	Still, I also know that I wouldn't want to have to make any of the decisions that he makes.	I'd like everyone to welcome back Dr. Reid.
We scoff......And we walk away.	Hey! Help me move this weekend.	Of course, you can't be ready for everything.	Dammit. Every morning, tapping. No one's ever there!
Oh, I see. Family only, everyone, that's how they're doing it.	You're not invited.	When is this joyous occasion?	Weird.
I'm not sure I see how that's funny.	I am lying.	I am honored.	Newbie, give me a break. Of course you're going. As a matter of fact, I'd I'd like you to be the boy's godfather.
Ooh, Cassie's pretty.	I don't know why I even bother ovulating. Little Haley doesn't have a chance this month. I name my eggs, big frick. Last month, it was Cassie.	Once a month? That's crazy!	Of course I knew that, Turk, I'm a doctor.
Nothing about taking a talented go-getter under his wing, or being a surrogate father to a boy who's lost his own? Nothing about that at all, I'm surprised. That's interesting to me, but OK.	No...	Hi, I'm J.D. I'm sure Perry's spoken of me.	Ahh! Here for the baptism. I remember my son, Harrison's big day. All of us laughing at him in his frilly little baptism dress. Well, we're not laughing anymore, Harrison's a poofter. Bob Kelso.
Oh, they don't talk much, everybody. There's no talking in the family.	Perry and I don't talk much.	Don't cry in front of people.	Nothing about taking a talented go-getter under his wing, or being a surrogate father to a boy who's lost his own? Nothing about that at all, I'm surprised. That's interesting to me, but OK.
That's how he likes it.	Hallelujah! A brother's 'bout to have some sex. Ha-Ha-Hallelujah! A brother's 'bout to have some seeeeeex! Smack the money maker! Smack it!	I'm not sure why it was suddenly so awkward, but I wish something would break the tension.	I embrace the Lord, Jesus Christ as my personal savior.
He's married, so it's strictly procreation sex! His wife's throwing her legs up in the air because they're trying for a boy....Like Jesus.	Awww, sex time, people!	That's how he likes it.	Hallelujah! A brother's 'bout to have some sex. Ha-Ha-Hallelujah! A brother's 'bout to have some seeeeeex! Smack the money maker! Smack it!
It's always hard to find the right words in a moment like this.	Uh-huh.	Probably the room to room thing.	I don't know. Maybe the TV was broken one day and she picked up the bible instead and found it to be just a darn good read. Or maybe it had something to do with our mother's ability to watch silently as our dad drunkenly knocked us from room to room. What do you think there, Newbie?
Dammit! Stupid baptism.	Yeah. You're not going.	Dr. Cox, if it makes you feel any better, at the baptism I'll be there to keep Paige company.	It's always hard to find the right words in a moment like this.
No I'm not. Stop doing that. Peanut butter egg dirt!	I knew you would. You're very predictable.	I'll do it.	And then it occurred to me. This was the perfect opportunity to take an enemy and turn him into a friend.
It's never easy to tell a family that medicine isn't working.	Newbie, let's go, Mr. Donnelly's test results are in.	No I'm not. Stop doing that. Peanut butter egg dirt!	I knew you would. You're very predictable.
Ar you actually complaining about getting to have sex? Because that is so insensitive, Turk.	Ugh. Dammit, I've gotta go have ovulation sex again.	Pie.I've got to find an improv class that doesn't meet in the back of a pie shop.	Republican.
Let me feel my feelings, Turk! We worked on this!	J.D...	Ar you actually complaining about getting to have sex? Because that is so insensitive, Turk.	Ugh. Dammit, I've gotta go have ovulation sex again.
Noted. That was quite a fight you had with your sister yesterday. Won't it be a little awkward when you show up at St. Mary's cathedral on the corner of Maple and Pine, right across from Temple Oheb Shalom at 4 PM today?	Never. Say that. Again.	Morning, sunshine!	Continue.
Mark my words, when that little bastard is dipped in water, I will be there.	That's not where the baptism is, but nice try.	Noted. That was quite a fight you had with your sister yesterday. Won't it be a little awkward when you show up at St. Mary's cathedral on the corner of Maple and Pine, right across from Temple Oheb Shalom at 4 PM today?	Never. Say that. Again.
You don't have to rub it in her face.	Anyway, I just invited Paige to come by, Mr. Donnelly's labs came back. It looks like the steroid is finally working. If you happen to be keeping score at home, that would be Medicine: 1, God: 0.	Mark my words, when that little bastard is dipped in water, I will be there.	That's not where the baptism is, but nice try.
Actually, there was.	Yeah, and I don't have to stick Dr. Kelso's stethoscope down my pants every morning, but I still do. Now isn't there some other relationship out there you could be trying to fix?	You don't have to rub it in her face.	Anyway, I just invited Paige to come by, Mr. Donnelly's labs came back. It looks like the steroid is finally working. If you happen to be keeping score at home, that would be Medicine: 1, God: 0.
Nobody seems to.	I don't like that.	Morning, sunshine.	Actually, there was.
I hope I can find a way to connect with him.	Well, come on. Let's grab some boxes and get to moving, huh?	Nobody seems to.	I don't like that.
You're welcome, friend.I gotta say, you've got a lot of Asian art around here.	Thanks for saving that. That's one of my favorite pieces.	I hope I can find a way to connect with him.	Well, come on. Let's grab some boxes and get to moving, huh?
Doesn't sound crazy at all.	When I was kid, I always thought I'd travel the world, you know? So after college, I went to China. Did all the normal touristy things, I saw the Great Wall, ate the food, had a baby with a local. You know, just the regular stuff. Anyway, I guess I decorate my place this way because it reminds me of a more optimistic time. That probably sounds crazy.	You're welcome, friend.I gotta say, you've got a lot of Asian art around here.	Thanks for saving that. That's one of my favorite pieces.
And like that, I was in.	Thanks, buddy.	Doesn't sound crazy at all.	When I was kid, I always thought I'd travel the world, you know? So after college, I went to China. Did all the normal touristy things, I saw the Great Wall, ate the food, had a baby with a local. You know, just the regular stuff. Anyway, I guess I decorate my place this way because it reminds me of a more optimistic time. That probably sounds crazy.
We're as thick as two thieves in a pod.	Well, what doesn't kill you...	Long story short, after confirming it with my bunk mates, that counselor and his "friendship lotion" were transferred out of our cabin and we never spoke about it again.	Man!
Thanks, pal.	OK. Time to move some of the heavier stuff. So you might want to put on these gloves. And the attic upstairs has a lot of fiberglass in it. So here's a hat.	We're as thick as two thieves in a pod.	Well, what doesn't kill you...
I figured out why I'm so great at managing relationships. I don't rub things in people's faces.	Sure, bud.	Thanks, pal.	OK. Time to move some of the heavier stuff. So you might want to put on these gloves. And the attic upstairs has a lot of fiberglass in it. So here's a hat.
And I've always known that if I make the slightest gesture of friendship to a difficult coworker...	Angry sex is awesome.	I never go to bed very, very mad.	You big jerk!
...I'll end up robbing an Asian couple's house.	Who are you?	And I've always known that if I make the slightest gesture of friendship to a difficult coworker...	Angry sex is awesome.
And two, whether some relationships were beyond repair. Then fate threw me another curve.	Gizmo.	Now that I'm on the lam, I thought about two things. One, what my prison name would be...	Worth it!
Hey, who's your friend?	And two, whether some relationships were beyond repair. Then fate threw me another curve.	Gizmo.	Now that I'm on the lam, I thought about two things. One, what my prison name would be...
Well, seeing as he gave me the strength to outrun the Sheriff's K-9 unit, I'd say he's my new god.You can rub mine's belly if I can rub yours.	My boy in a dress. Who's yours?	Hey, who's your friend?	And two, whether some relationships were beyond repair. Then fate threw me another curve.
I don't whine or cry.	I wasn't talking to him.	He seems fine.	There will be no whining or crying while we sit here, understood?
These are coasters.	Really. How do you explain these photos of you whining and crying as you run away from the Kwan's apartment?	I don't whine or cry.	I wasn't talking to him.
You turned me into a felon!	My camera's broken.	These are coasters.	Really. How do you explain these photos of you whining and crying as you run away from the Kwan's apartment?
No, thank you. If there's one thing I learned from this guy, it's that I need to stop trying to fix people's relationships.	You know what, there, Newbie? You can go to the baptism. Take Jack. Jordan will kill me if he's not there. Plus, I know you. You're exactly one watered-down appletini away from trying to fix my sister and me.	You turned me into a felon!	My camera's broken.
Still. I've never know you to judge a person based on their beliefs. In fact, you're pretty tolerant of everyone. Except Hugh Jackman.	You're welcome.	No, thank you.

Jordan will kill me if he's not there. Plus, I know you. You're exactly one watered-down appletini away from trying to fix my sister and me.
I just don't understand why your sister being religious bothers you so much.	Eh.	Still. I've never know you to judge a person based on their beliefs. In fact, you're pretty tolerant of everyone. Except Hugh Jackman.	You're welcome.
Then why are you so angry?	It doesn't.	I just don't understand why your sister being religious bothers you so much.	Eh.
...Or for some, just a relaxing afternoon soak on the roof.	Dammit, you'd better find it! Physical therapy tubs don't just disappear!	...Cursing out an innocent orderly over a stolen physical therapy tub....	Save your voice, Marcia. Mm. Save it.
Yeah, well he's six. What's he gonna do, kick my ass?	Ronald's gonna be mad.	Wah! My eyes!Well, yeah, it hurts. But when you accept the keys to the hog, you become a lifetime member of the danger club. Excuse me, fine ladies. I've got lives to save.	You try to get in here wearing that thing and I'm gonna give you a four-story atomic wedgie.
For doctors, pain is complicated. Every patient handles it differently, depending on their race...	Hey, check this guy's chart out. He says he's been in pain for, like, three months.	Again.	Yeah, well he's six. What's he gonna do, kick my ass?
...gender...	Does what hurt?	For doctors, pain is complicated. Every patient handles it differently, depending on their race...	Hey, check this guy's chart out. He says he's been in pain for, like, three months.
...or even their sex life.	Ow! I just bit the inside of my lip! Agh! Nothing's ever hurt so badly!	...gender...	Does what hurt?
And since there's no way to truly gauge how much pain someone's in, we have to rely on an archaic chart.	OHHHHHH....yeah, that feels good.	...or even their sex life.	Ow! I just bit the inside of my lip! Agh! Nothing's ever hurt so badly!
OK, my bad, so we're not crystal clear on the ground rules. OK, tomorrow it will be the last one to touch my face. Nah, I'm not gonna like that. The last one to touch my bot No, that's probably illegal. I tell you what, I'll just email everyone. That's what I'll do. This day and age that's what you do. OK, over here. Guys, Mr. Jenkins spent all night without being treated. Now, I know he's homeless and smell's like an obese man's twosie.	But I feel like I edged out James.	Lisa, call that androgynous husband of yours and tell him or her you're mine this weekend.	What? I totally beat Lisa.
Sorry, thought you were dozing. The thing is, guys, it doesn't matter if he's a homeless guy or some senile old racist.	Hey!	OK, my bad, so we're not crystal clear on the ground rules.

Immigrants, Mr. Bursick. You hate all immigrants.	Which people do I hate again?	Sorry, thought you were dozing. The thing is, guys, it doesn't matter if he's a homeless guy or some senile old racist.	Hey!
I don't have time, Mr. Bursick. Guys, if I give you a patient, I expect you to work your butts off for him. And P.S., Mr. Jenkins is a Vietnam vet. So let's take care of him like he took care of our nation. Get out of here!That's how you light a fire under their butts, Perry, you get 'em going with some inspiration!	And why do I hate	Immigrants, Mr. Bursick. You hate all immigrants.	Which people do I hate again?
Because she's my patient.	Too much talking, too much talking, too much talking, too much talking, too much talking, too much talking. Why did you order a BMP test on my patient, Mrs. Wilk, last night?	I don't have time, Mr. Bursick. Guys, if I give you a patient, I expect you to work your butts off for him.

and *I* treated her last night.	Interesting, seeing as *I* admitted her	Because she's my patient.	Too much talking, too much talking, too much talking, too much talking, too much talking, too much talking. Why did you order a BMP test on my patient, Mrs. Wilk, last night?
Because they're stealing all of our jobs, Mr. Bursick, stealing all of our jobs. Perry, we've spent an equal amount of time on Mrs. Wilk, and seeing as we're both attendings, i.e. equals, why don't we let her decide who her doctor is, huh?	Dr. Dorian, why do I hate all	and *I* treated her last night.	Interesting, seeing as *I* admitted her
I was a premie.	He played hearts with me all night.You're a very strange young man, aren't you?	Oh my God. Oh, my God, I don't even believe it! I don't believe it! I don't believe it-lieve it-lieve it! Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo! Yes! I'm shaking, look at this. It's crazy talk.	I choose Dr. Dorian.
Oops. This one's actually from my Aunt Judy and her lady friends. Must have grabbed the wrong card.	"Happy Anniversary, gals?"	Hellooo! If you're wondering what a thank-you-for-being-my-doctor card from Mrs. Wilk looks like, it looks a little something like this.	You'll be there. You'll all be there.
Oh, right, your imaginary warning light. Don't be mad, Perry, this day was bound to come. See, I've studied you. I've taken your best qualities and my best qualities and I've combined them into something even better. Much the way that iced tea and lemonade were joined to become an Arnold Palmer. Incidentally, has anyone ever done less to become famous? I mean, yea for me, I mixed two drinks together.	Uhh, Newbie...	Oops. This one's actually from my Aunt Judy and her lady friends. Must have grabbed the wrong card.	"Happy Anniversary, gals?"
I'm sure he has lots of hobbies, Perry. The man's a drink mogul.	Arnold Palmer is a golfer.	Oh, right, your imaginary warning light. Don't be mad, Perry, this day was bound to come.

Uhh, Newbie...
Do you have any family, Mrs. Wilk?	In a hospital, even the best of moods can be ruined by somebody handing you a chart.	I'm sure he has lots of hobbies, Perry. The man's a drink mogul.	Arnold Palmer is a golfer.
Look, Mrs. Wilk, you have something called systemic amyloidosis. Now, it's in your liver now, but eventually it will shut down all your organs. There's a treatment, but it's very invasive, and at best, it'll just give you a little more time.	No. I was married twice. Divorced one, the other one died. Wrong one died.	Do you have any family, Mrs. Wilk?	In a hospital, even the best of moods can be ruined by somebody handing you a chart.
Say no more. I'm gonna take amazing care of you.	Well, I've had a great life son.	Look, Mrs. Wilk, you have something called systemic amyloidosis.

I always wondered what exploratory surgery was like.	OK. Elliot turfed this chronic pain patient to me. I have no idea what's wrong with him, so I have to do exploratory surgery.	Pretty crappy. I just had to tell an old lady she's dying. How about you?	How's it going today, buddy?
Watch out for colon darts.	I've made the first incision. I'm going in.Nurse! Hat!Colon. Why did it have to be the colon?Removing the golden tumor.Ladies...They knew the risks.	I always wondered what exploratory surgery was like.	OK. Elliot turfed this chronic pain patient to me. I have no idea what's wrong with him, so I have to do exploratory surgery.
No, no, no, not not Seattle. The you know, the dying peacefully place.	Seattle?	For the place that you're going. You know, the big, puffy, clouds? The bright lights? All your old friends?	I'm going to sit for this.
Oh, this is just a misunderstanding, I'm so sorry. Tell it was a misunderstanding, that...	Exactly, and I'd like to continue it.	This morning you told me you'd had a great life.	Now, I'm going to stand.
I gotta get Mrs. Wilk back.When did we have a shade remote? I didn't know we had shade remotes.	Now I'm going to check on Mr. Jenkins, your war hero. I feel he, too, deserves a competent doctor. In fact, I'm gonna take all of your patients, and consequently, your only reason for getting out of that lacy, over-pillowed, four poster virgin cocoon you call a bed every morning.	I find this highly unprofessional.	In victory, I get your stethoscope. It's a trophy. You're lucky we're not back in olden times. I'd have made a necklace out of your teeth.
Vampire doctors? How did he hear about my screenplay?	Aww, either your picture didn't come out, or we got a hospital full of vampire doctors.	I gotta get Mrs. Wilk back.When did we have a shade remote? I didn't know we had shade remotes.	Now I'm going to check on Mr. Jenkins, your war hero. I feel he, too, deserves a competent doctor.

That's what they call me. How you doing?The end.	Right away, Dr. Acula.	Ms. Brooks, your blood work looks fine. But I'd like to take one more sample. Just for me.You know, you taste a little anemic. Get that down to the lab, buddy.	I actually love these.
He's both. And at the very end, I'm gonna put "Dr. Acula" across the screen, take that period, get it out of there. Squish it together, it'll say "Dracula"	So Dr. Acula is a doctor *and* a vampire?	That's what they call me. How you doing?The end.	Right away, Dr. Acula.
Um, thank you for telling me what I already know, Turk.	That is an awesome ending!	He's both. And at the very end, I'm gonna put "Dr. Acula" across the screen, take that period, get it out of there. Squish it together, it'll say "Dracula"	So Dr. Acula is a doctor *and* a vampire?
You just lit your pipe on my title page.	Hey, sport!	AHH! My screenplay!	Probably not.
She said "I've lead a great life." And every doctor in the world knows that's code for "I'm ready to die."	I heard Mrs. Wilk gave you the axe.	You just lit your pipe on my title page.	Hey, sport!
OK, there's no way to answer that and not get in trouble. Change the subject.	How old do you think I am, Dorian?	She said "I've lead a great life." And every doctor in the world knows that's code for "I'm ready to die."	I heard Mrs. Wilk gave you the axe.
Oh my God, he's actually thinking about it. Change the subject back!	Well, it would be good for Enid to get out of the house.	Sir, I would be honored if you and Enid would join me at my place on Sunday for some homemade jambalaya.	OK, there's no way to answer that and not get in trouble. Change the subject.
Jambalaya.	You think I'm that old?	You're seventy-eight, sir.	Oh my God, he's actually thinking about it. Change the subject back!
Really.	I'm fifty-seven, numb nuts.	Jambalaya.	You think I'm that old?
Who?	I know they say fifty-seven is the new forty.	Really.	I'm fifty-seven, numb nuts.
Brookstone? Were you looking for gadgets, sir?	But lately it seems all people see when they look in my direction is some old guy. Hell, just last week I was in the mall hanging out in Brookstone's and some kid asked me if I was lost.	Who?	I know they say fifty-seven is the new forty.
Oh.	If that's what you trolling for mall ass, then yeah.	Brookstone? Were you looking for gadgets, sir?	But lately it seems all people see when they look in my direction is some old guy. Hell, just last week I was in the mall hanging out in Brookstone's and some kid asked me if I was lost.
Sometimes when you're feeling guilty, it's like a storm cloud over your head.	Carla did not know that story. Thank you.	Turk did that in college on a bet.	I should have just believed Mr. Peele. I mean it's not like somebody poos their pants for no reason.
You're welcome. You got a lot of pluck for an older gal.	Yes, you were. Thank you.	I knew there was only one way to make the guilt storm go away.Mrs. Wilk, I'm sorry.Mrs. Wilk, I just wanted to say I was wrong to think that you wouldn't want to try every possible treatment there is, to avoid, you know, the place. You know, there's clouds and...Space Needle...Seattle.	Sometimes when you're feeling guilty, it's like a storm cloud over your head.
Jambalaya!	How old do you think I am?	You're welcome. You got a lot of pluck for an older gal.	Yes, you were. Thank you.
Thank you.	Say, Newbie. I uh, I gotta hand it to you. It took the heart of a lion to apologize to Mrs. Wilk like that.	The important thing is to regain the respect of your peers.	Thank you.
Really? You've been spending a lot of time treating my guy, Mr. Jenkins, right?	Of course it took the incompetence of a bewildered jackass to make that error to begin with. Never make assumptions based on your own perceptions. Just never do it.	Thank you.	Say, Newbie. I uh, I gotta hand it to you. It took the heart of a lion to apologize to Mrs. Wilk like that.
Yeah, actually he's just a homeless guy. I made up the war veteran story to motivate my boys. But, what are you gonna do?Oh, come on, you've gotten me like a hundred times. I finally got you once. It was bound to happen, right?	Yeah, he's a Vietnam veteran. He deserves as much.	Really? You've been spending a lot of time treating my guy, Mr. Jenkins, right?	Of course it took the incompetence of a bewildered jackass to make that error to begin with. Never make assumptions based on your own perceptions. Just never do it.
We didn't exchange pleasantries.	Was his name Julian?	Where was I?You're not aware of any sort of odd, underground canal system beneath the hospital, are you? I think I saw a manatee.	Here comes a big 'un!
What's red for?	That's Julian. Watch it, wet paint. Kelso's starting a new line system to help people get around. Green's gonna go to the smoker's lounge, blue to the ICU, and yellow to all the exits.	We didn't exchange pleasantries.	Was his name Julian?
OK, I'm here. What's the emergency Keith?	Sneaker painting.	What's red for?	That's Julian. Watch it, wet paint. Kelso's starting a new line system to help people get around. Green's gonna go to the smoker's lounge, blue to the ICU, and yellow to all the exits.
They're the exact same thing. Every doctor here knows that. Why would you page me?	Uh, do you want Mr. Fleming on unfractionated or low molecular weight Heparin?	OK, I'm here. What's the emergency Keith?	Sneaker painting.
Good page, good page!	He sneezed and all his surgical staples popped out!	Done, and I am outta here.Dammit!Keith, you've got to stop paging me for totally unimportant things!Ohhh! That man's chest cavity is completely open. I can see his heart beating.	That's what I'm talking about.
Ever since her fellowship, Elliot loved that her interns saw her as an endocrinology expert.	OK, rock-tors. That's my name for doctors who rock. Next patient.	Good page, good page!	He sneezed and all his surgical staples popped out!
I didn't know what I was high-fiving, I gotta stop doing that.	You're going to high-five that? Bi-hig mistake.	Here's some!	Oh, really? Well you never went to assface school, but you seem to be an expert at that. Am I right?
No.	Did you eat my mango body butter?	I didn't know what I was high-fiving, I gotta stop doing that.	You're going to high-five that? Bi-hig mistake.
They can lie.	You know, I've donated an organ.	When a career opportunity is slipping through their fingers, even a doctor can succumb to one of the basest human impulses.	We're just not sure, Dr. Turk.
Well, if you don't want a baby, Carla, don't have a baby.	I'm a nurse, J.D., I'm trained to fake it. I just don't understand whats so adorable in "Yay, you made a poopie in the potty!" I'm supposed to be impressed? There's a monkey at the zoo who can do that. I mean, you know, when he's not playing with himself.	What are you talking about? You're the most maternal person I know.	J.D., I have to admit this to somebody. I don't like kids!
Just try to imagine what they're going through. I mean sometimes I think about what it's gonna be like when you die.	Thank you! Now how do I tell those people to let their so go?	OK, I'll help.	Fine!
Right, and where do we meet up in heaven?	Because you think I'm going first because of my diabetes.	Just try to imagine what they're going through. I mean sometimes I think about what it's gonna be like when you die.	Thank you! Now how do I tell those people to let their so go?
I'll see you there, player! I love religion. The point is, Turk, if someone tried to pull the plug on you without being totally honest with you, you know where they'd end up?	At the milkshake pool on the lesbian cloud.	Right, and where do we meet up in heaven?	Because you think I'm going first because of my diabetes.
Next to the super-high, unreachable cupcake table.	In hell, watching The View.	I'll see you there, player! I love religion. The point is, Turk, if someone tried to pull the plug on you without being totally honest with you, you know where they'd end up?	At the milkshake pool on the lesbian cloud.
Can you press "lobby," please?	After trying to get out of the hospital vertically, I decided to go the horizontal route: hiding in a body bag.	Next to the super-high, unreachable cupcake table.	In hell, watching The View.
OWW!! OWW!! OWW!!! DOUG! Why are you hitting me?!?	GYAAAAAHHHH-DAH!!!	Can you press "lobby," please?	After trying to get out of the hospital vertically, I decided to go the horizontal route: hiding in a body bag.
Then why were you hitting me?!	Because I thought you were a dead guy coming back to life!	OWW!! OWW!! OWW!!! DOUG! Why are you hitting me?!?	GYAAAAAHHHH-DAH!!!
No, no! Elliot, I'm not even supposed to be here, I'm going home!	There, you are. Come on.	Then why were you hitting me?!	Because I thought you were a dead guy coming back to life!
Wha-? You are good.	Hmm.	Still, I love it when Bonds wins at the game that he plays. Look, Elliot, you know how people become specialists? They obsess about the material over and over again until it becomes lodged into their brains. That's exactly what you've been doing. Watch, where's the closest page you've hidden around here?	OK, you knew he's an athlete of some kind. Just say something general.
All right look. What's the leading differential in an obese woman suffering from amenorrhea and hirsutism?	Hmm.	Wha-? You are good.	Hmm.
Oh, don't be such a baby, it's a magnetic image. I apologize, Mr. Foster, I'm a little upset. My scooter, Sasha was assassinated this morning.	Is this gonna hurt?	There was a wall! What's the matter with you?Who is still shooting? She's down!It's over!	All right! All right! OK.
Oh come on, Turk, it was just a joke. And I only wore it for one week.	Yeah, he was so attached to that thing. He used to wear a bracelet that said "Sasha Forever."	Oh, don't be such a baby, it's a magnetic image. I apologize, Mr. Foster, I'm a little upset. My scooter, Sasha was assassinated this morning.	Is this gonna hurt?
Now let's fire this baby up.OK, so I still wear the bracelet.	Whatever.	Oh come on, Turk, it was just a joke. And I only wore it for one week.	Yeah, he was so attached to that thing. He used to wear a bracelet that said "Sasha Forever."
Shoe shopping.	You see, uh, yesterday I went shoe shopping and there was this one pair of...	When women want men to completely zone out, there's always one thing they can talk about.	Was it naughty?
Good news, Mr. Foster. The radiologist said your scan is completely clear, but we'd like to keep you here for a few more tests.	Be specific.	Were they D's?	Cool. Oh, I almost forgot. Lace bra.
A lot of weird things can happen in a hospital. Like Doug not getting a dead body out of his bed before rigor mortis sets in.	Whatever you say, doc.	Good news, Mr. Foster. The radiologist said your scan is completely clear, but we'd like to keep you here for a few more tests.	Be specific.
You really gotta change that cellphone ring.	Well! If it isn't the four horsewomen of the apocalypse. There's a Morbidity and Mortality conference tomorrow morning to figure out who is responsible for Mr. Foster's death and here's the exciting news. I'm pretty sure it was one of you.	...is dead the next. Of course, in hospitals this happens a lot, so you have to shake it off and move on. Except when this happens.	Still, the weirdest thing is when a really cool guy who's fine and talking to you one minute...
Uh, Mr. Foster had recently flown to India, where had been exposed to an outbreak of pertussis. I was going to check on his labs, but first I had to visit another patient, Mr. Sutton.So, Mr. Sutton, when you came with heartburn, I bet you thought I'd kick your butt right out of here. But not this guy. I admitted you and I stayed up all night studying your EKG because I had a hunch, and no girlfriend. But it was mostly the hunch thing. And that hunch paid off because if I hadn't found that blocked artery, you'd be dead right now.	And then what happened?Dorian. I'm ten feet away from you. Talk.	Yes.Mic check, mic check.Yes.	Dorian, you admitted Mr. Foster with coughing and shortness of breath. Is that correct?
I can't believe he didn't thank me. You'll thank me when you leave, won't you?	Later, dude.	And here comes the gratitude. The two words every doctor lives to hear.

Can opener!	Anytime, buddy! Anytime. Wait for him, wait for him.	Thanks for inviting me over, Janitor.	Why?
Something feels pinchy. WHOA! AAH! WAAAH!! AAAAHH!!	The lobster's in the pot! Devour! Devour!	Can opener!	Anytime, buddy! Anytime. Wait for him, wait for him.
Yeah, I'd spend the money researching how to successfully separate my head from my body. That way I could literally be in two places at once.	Here we go.	Me? Floating-Head Doctor.	Anyway, that explains why I went into the room and said...What would you do with a hundred million dollars?
Well, there would probably be some kinks to work out initially.	Looking good, Mr. Henderson. Looking real good, Nurse Meyers.Uh-oh, he's flat-lining! Body, come!Dammit! Starting CPR.Oww!	Yeah, I'd spend the money researching how to successfully separate my head from my body. That way I could literally be in two places at once.	Here we go.
Oh, pass, huh? Well this is what happened last time you passed.	Pass.	They waffle ironed my foot. But this different, buddy. Look, I need a ride.	It's like the time you were convinced that the cafeteria workers were giving you small waffles. How'd that work out for you?
OK. Just back away slowly.Oh no, Turk. They're organized!AAAHH!!	J.D...Dude?	This is where Sutton lives, right? Let's get in there.	Yi.
And there it was. Hope. Dr. Kelso's inability to deal with hunger was legendary. We were as good as home.	Good lord, Bobbo, was that your stomach?	OK. Just back away slowly.Oh no, Turk. They're organized!AAAHH!!	J.D...Dude?
Wooohhh!!	J.D., J.D., uh, J.D.!	Here comes your vanilla bear!	Dude, can I admit something to you? I kind of missed not getting my hug today.
Oh, thank God.	Oh! Dude, don't sweat it. It says here that the ostrich is generally a docile creature.	Wooohhh!!	J.D., J.D., uh, J.D.!
What?! I'm coming back up!Turk?WAAAAHHH!!Mr. Sutton, I hope this isn't a bad time.	It also says their kick can kill a man.	Oh, thank God.	Oh! Dude, don't sweat it. It says here that the ostrich is generally a docile creature.
OK look, Mr. Sutton, I'm sure you're wondering why...	They're such majestic creatures, don't you think? And, you know, they're kind of like my children. Plus, I make belts out of their necks.	Why ostriches?	Ugh, why did I make him Jewish? My parents will kill me.
Oh.	I did escape. There was one waiting in the car.	You OK? Did you try and escape?	There *is* a door.
Mr. Sutton, I cured you and you never thanked me.	That's Leon. Loves car rides. Likes to stick his head out the window and I tell him it's a little too dangerous, but he doesn't listen to me.	Oh.	I did escape. There was one waiting in the car.
Ruh-roh.	Uhh..	I just don't see why it's such a big deal for you to say, "hey, doc..." Why did he just walk away like that?	Stupid bird stole my hat.
I do admit, he looks pretty phat in your Kango.	Don't move.	Ruh-roh.	Uhh..
This whole experience got me thinking about the nature of gratitude. I guess in the end...	I can't, I was supposed to be on call five minutes ago.	Yes! Jabbar'e has been added to the hug schedule. You want to wait with me?	Dude, are you really gonna sit here all day just to thank your garbageman?
Sorry, sir, uh, um, sometimes I like to just sum things up.	Dorian. What are you doing?	...whether you're a doctor or a garbageman...	This whole experience got me thinking about the nature of gratitude. I guess in the end...
Oh, thank you, but I'm not big on blind dates, and I know, I haven't hit it in awhile, but there's good reason for that.	Oh, you're such a nice young man. I'd love to set you up with my grand-niece.	Well, Mrs. Nichols, it was an honor being your doctor.	Excellent. OK, we'll be in touch.
Sticks and stones may break my bones!	Two good reasons. His face and his personality.	Oh, thank you, but I'm not big on blind dates, and I know, I haven't hit it in awhile, but there's good reason for that.	Oh, you're such a nice young man. I'd love to set you up with my grand-niece.
Anyway, for me to be set up with your niece, I'd need to know a lot more about her.	But words will hurt forever.	Sticks and stones may break my bones!	Two good reasons. His face and his personality.
My blind date should be here any second. I gotta thank Mrs. Nichols for setting this up.Oh, Mrs. Nichols, you blue-haired bitch! Wait, she's veering off. Phew!OK, Mrs. Nichols, your new hip is on the house because this girl is amazing! Yet there's something accessible about her. I wonder what it is.	She's single.	Anyway, for me to be set up with your niece, I'd need to know a lot more about her.	But words will hurt forever.
So, she was a bit of a klutz.	Ooh, I'm gonna have the carrot cake.	My blind date should be here any second. I gotta thank Mrs. Nichols for setting this up.Oh, Mrs. Nichols, you blue-haired bitch! Wait, she's veering off. Phew!OK, Mrs. Nichols, your new hip is on the house because this girl is amazing! Yet there's something accessible about her. I wonder what it is.	She's single.
No.	Did you see that? Please say no.	So, she was a bit of a klutz.	Ooh, I'm gonna have the carrot cake.
Me too! Do you ever, like, drift off and have weird fantasies?	I ride a scooter, I love Harry Potter so much I sometimes wish I was a wizard, and I've hated sports since I was a kid.	From that moment on, it was the greatest date ever. We had so much in common.	No.
So do you wanna see if they'll give us more coffee or do you just want to call it a night?	Sometimes.	Me too! Do you ever, like, drift off and have weird fantasies?	I ride a scooter, I love Harry Potter so much I sometimes wish I was a wizard, and I've hated sports since I was a kid.
Ha! Why don't you ask her if our date sucked. She's in my room.	So, I guess your date sucked, huh?	My roommate. Back in one second.	J.D., you home?
Unlikely! Because what's waiting for me in my room is what's known in football terms as a slam dunk .	Twenty bucks you blow it in less than five minutes.	Ha! Why don't you ask her if our date sucked. She's in my room.	So, I guess your date sucked, huh?
Hugsies.	God, I feel so stupid.	I wasn't saying that you smelled like my mom, I was saying that you smelled like memum. It's an exotic flower that's indigenous to the hills of Costa Rica.	I convinced Julie to meet me by explaining that my comment in the bedroom was a simple miscommunication.
Yes.	I'll see you later?	Ohh, Mommy.	Hugsies.
Isn't she great?	Bye.	It does, it happens.	Oh no, it happens.
You're telling me what to say, next you're gonna be telling me how to kiss her. I mean, where does it end?	So, you got the second date. Just don't repeat the same mistakes you made with me. For instance, don't speed down the road and pretend your brakes are out. I don't care if it got you laid once in high school. It is not funny, and I still have not forgiven you for killing that family's pony. But most importantly, if you ever find yourself in a romantic situation again, ignore whatever pops into your head. Just look into her eyes and say these exact words: I'm. So glad. I found you.	Isn't she great?	Bye.
Nah, while you were in the bathroom I set the clock two hours ahead so you'd think time was just flying by.	Seriously?	I am having so much fun hanging out with you. Can you believe we've been talking for two hours?	Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha, no he won't!
Looking at her, I knew what the future held for Julie and me.	Really? While I was in the bathroom, I wrote my name on the mirror with my finger so the next time you took a hot shower and it fogged up, you'd think that ghosts where trying to tell you to be with me.	Nah, while you were in the bathroom I set the clock two hours ahead so you'd think time was just flying by.	Seriously?
Thanks for doing that.I wanted a picture of us old, you know? That way if one of us dies in a tragic skiing accident, we'll always have that memory of us together.	Oh, God this mask is hot.	Smile.	Looking at her, I knew what the future held for Julie and me.
OK, romance is in the air. You gotta say something. Tell her about the hit and run. Nah, she probably loves ponies. Ask her if she's been tested. Why are all these odd thoughts popping into my head? My, God, look at the size of her feet. Tell her! Stop it! OK, the silence is going on too long. Just say that thing that Elliot told you, even though it's stupid.	That's so sweet! So what do you want to do now?	Thanks for doing that.I wanted a picture of us old, you know? That way if one of us dies in a tragic skiing accident, we'll always have that memory of us together.	Oh, God this mask is hot.
Oh, really? That came through?	Oh, really? Because I just got your text that said bone city.	Ahhhh, morning, Elliot. By the way, Julie's here. I'm not gonna kiss and tell.	It's not like you're the king around here.
Dating my laptop.	No, I am talking about how you go a million miles an hour the minute you fall for someone. Don't go too quickly, or just like I said, you'll just end up with another beautiful girl.	If you're referring to the game Find the Saltine, relax. I don't even play that with Turk any more.	Right. In your face, ha ha! Thank you. You know, I actually like Julie, so don't do that thing you always do.
You're not broker of the year Whit Prowdy.	J.D., this is a mistake.	Which consists of two shares of Eastern Airlines stock and a pack of unopened Les Mis trading cards.	No, it's a sound investment and a great addition to my portfolio.
Why should I believe you?	Don't do this, you're going too fast.	You're not broker of the year Whit Prowdy.	J.D., this is a mistake.
I hate you, Whit Prowdy.	Because honesty is my business.	Why should I believe you?	Don't do this, you're going too fast.
OK! Hey, Buzz, I'm gonna beat you in poker next time!	Go to hell!	Hey, Clarks!	Unfortunately, the Clarks felt that if we weren't building a house, we weren't technically their neighbors.
Hi.	The Morgans on the other side were much friendlier. But I don't think we're gonna have them over again.	OK! Hey, Buzz, I'm gonna beat you in poker next time!	Go to hell!
I'm sorry, no thank you.	No.	Oooh, sweetie!	Wanna buy a baby?
Throwing in a crib.	I'll throw in a crib.	I'm sorry, no thank you.	No.
You OK, buttercup?	It didn't matter, because I was happy to look out at my beautiful half-acre with my sweet, but klutzy gal.	Throwing in a crib.	I'll throw in a crib.
Turk and I had discovered a new way to deal with Kelso's bad moods.	The glass broke in my mouth.	You OK, buttercup?	It didn't matter, because I was happy to look out at my beautiful half-acre with my sweet, but klutzy gal.
I almost bought a baby yesterday.	I just got my period.This really sucks. I've been trying to get pregnant for two months now.	It usually bought us a few minutes of peace. But then Carla said something that deeply disturbs every man on God's green earth.	Spoonful of peanut butter, sir?
Don't tell them, in case you want it later!	What?	I almost bought a baby yesterday.	I just got my period.This really sucks. I've been trying to get pregnant for two months now.
You know who else is a great rebounder? Dr. Mickhead.His wife was killed on Saturday.	It's a basketball thing, I'm a great rebounder.	What's Glass Man?	Yo, Glass Man!
Hey, Mickhead!	Hey, guys.	You know who else is a great rebounder? Dr. Mickhead.His wife was killed on Saturday.	It's a basketball thing, I'm a great rebounder.
He's still a person of interest.	The police cleared him yet?	Hey, Mickhead!	Hey, guys.
Yep, there was eye candy for all. And only one thing could upset this delicate balance.	Would you guys stop doing that?	And for the men, there was a new, sexy Latina nurse: Nurse Martinez.	I got a lot of pap. Move your head so I can see.
That's why they call him the glass man.	Wow. She looks like a young Carla.	Yep, there was eye candy for all. And only one thing could upset this delicate balance.	Would you guys stop doing that?
Uh, Turk and I got sex gongs in Chinatown. We're supposed to ring them whenever each one of us gets lucky. And even though I don't live with him anymore, I like to think that somewhere, somehow he hears it and it makes him happy.	What?	OK, we can stop there. Um, now it's time to ring the sex gong.	Shut up and take it, you stupid bitch!
How could I forget my sexiest move?	J.D., I knew you were faking it because at the end you didn't say "bombs away."	Hope my gong wasn't too loud for you this morning. I know it can be. It's a loud gong! I mean, it's like, gonnggg!	Yeah, buddy! Ha ha! That's my dog.
OK, from this moment on, I am officially out of my head.	J.D., she likes you. Just do yourself a favor and stay out of your head for once.	Great, now Julie thinks I'm lame, and weird and pathetic.	How could I forget my sexiest move?
Like Taye Diggs'!	Is it?	Don't listen to her, brown bear, your body is fierce!	And now his boyfriend will comfort him.
I'm saying all my thoughts out loud so I don't mess this relationship up.	What are you doing?	Do I want her to meet Turk this soon? What if he doesn't like her?	So when am I gonna get to meet Julie?
I forgot, sometimes Turk is slow. You know what? It's time for her to meet the people in my life. I think she's gonna do great.	I don't understand.	I'm saying all my thoughts out loud so I don't mess this relationship up.	What are you doing?
Yeah.	That's so funny!	Ha! We'll get you ladies some more coffee. Jordan, if you're willing to pay for it, just sit there frozen. How very generous.	...the slightly older still......and lastly, the very, very, very old. She is unconscious and virtually unwakable. Witness:Jordaroo! Jordalicious! Jordaroni! Uh-huh.
Doesn't it bother you that she never laughs at anything?	Dude, Julie's awesome.	Yeah.	That's so funny!
I mean when something's funny she never laughs. She just says "that's so funny." It's kind of annoying.	What do you mean?	Doesn't it bother you that she never laughs at anything?	Dude, Julie's awesome.
They're crazy about you. They're worried I'm gonna mess this whole thing up.	So your friends really like me?	I gotta get cooking. People are going to be here for this barbeque any second.	If Jordan were conscious, she'd she'd agree. Aw, now who put that fake arrow through her head? Huh? Which one of you? It was me. I did it.
The only jerk around here is the spicy marinade on this Jamaican chicken, mon.	Nah. You're not gonna be a jerk and do something like that, are you?	They're crazy about you. They're worried I'm gonna mess this whole thing up.	So your friends really like me?
It is, Julie, it it is. Why do you always do that?	That's so funny.	The only jerk around here is the spicy marinade on this Jamaican chicken, mon.	Nah. You're not gonna be a jerk and do something like that, are you?
Well you never laugh when something's funny. You just say "that's so funny."	Do what?	It is, Julie, it it is. Why do you always do that?	That's so funny.
Yes, I am.	You're an idiot.	Who knows? Could be anything.You know what's interesting, Turk? She's not saying "that's so sad," she's actually crying.	Why is Julie behind that bush, crying?
Oh, really? Remember Whitney the snapper?	That's because I was never as bad as you.	You used to be the same way. Somehow you got over it and now you're married.	Well you're just too picky about women.
All right. Why are we watching a movie again?	I'll go make some more.	You OK, sweetness?	I made popcorn!
But how can you guarantee that she's going to laugh at this movie?	It's called immersion therapy. What we're about to watch is going to make her say "that's so funny" so many times that eventually it's not going to bother you anymore.	All right. Why are we watching a movie again?	I'll go make some more.
Oooh. I like that.	Dude, relax. I was a Psych minor in college. The next time she says "that's so funny," I want you to pretend she says "that's so money."	The immersion therapy didn't work.	Call me JJ.
You know what? I really couldn't care less.	That's so funny! I'm sorry I said "that's so funny," I know that drives you crazy.	Ha ha. One-a-day vitamins. I'll tell you how they could double their profits: Two-a-day vitamins.	Here goes nothing.
I don't know. I mean, we already got the half-acre, right? And I imagine we'll eventually be able to build a house on it, and a little backyard, room for a slip and slide for our kids, Gilligan and The Skipper. I know, I'm sorry, I gotta do it, I lost a bet to Turk. And I don't want to rush things, but I feel good about this. I don't know, I feel like you and I could go the distance.	So what do we do now?	You know what? I really couldn't care less.	That's so funny! I'm sorry I said "that's so funny," I know that drives you crazy.
Oh. Tapas.	Um, actually I meant what do you want to order from take-out for dinner?	I don't know. I mean, we already got the half-acre, right?

Great for sharing.	I love tapas.	Oh. Tapas.	Um, actually I meant what do you want to order from take-out for dinner?
I love it. Just share and...	Sharing is fun.	Great for sharing.	I love tapas.
So you really don't think about that kind of stuff?	Share.	I love it. Just share and...	Sharing is fun.
You know what? We've just started dating, so I have a feeling this conversation goes down a really bad road. Why don't we just say we're never going to talk about it ever again, OK?	J.D., I'm only 23, and I don't even know if I want any of that stuff, and certainly not for the five or ten years.	So you really don't think about that kind of stuff?	Share.
OK.	OK.	You know what? We've just started dating, so I have a feeling this conversation goes down a really bad road. Why don't we just say we're never going to talk about it ever again, OK?	J.D., I'm only 23, and I don't even know if I want any of that stuff, and certainly not for the five or ten years.
OK. So you really feel that way?So here I am again. I can't believe I broke up with her. Why do I keep doing this?	OK. Whew.	OK.	OK.
It was August! The weather was far from frightful!	J.D., this was totally different. You didn't break up with her because she said "that's so funny," or because she was like Mini McSkinny and singing Christmas carols in the summertime.	OK. So you really feel that way?So here I am again. I can't believe I broke up with her. Why do I keep doing this?	OK. Whew.
She wasn't great at practical jokes.But still, we'd become inseparable.	AAAAHHH!! OH!! OH, MY GOD, THAT'S COLD!! AAAHHH!!! J.D.!!!	Now that we lived together, Elliot and I were getting tighter every day.	It's uncanny!
Where's Rex?	After six months on the job, some interns can become completely overwhelmed.	Damn those roller blades. OK, everybody, let's gather round.	Hmm, Newbie. Looks like it's you. All the best.
Put a blankie on him.	He's gone fetal again.	Where's Rex?	After six months on the job, some interns can become completely overwhelmed.
Unfortunately, young Keith had become competent so quickly that every word out of his chiseled mouth came tainted with an arrogant smugness that he couldn't hide no matter how hard he tried.	I've got it!	Put a blankie on him.	He's gone fetal again.
Right on cue.	Is there anything else I can do, Dr. Dorian?	Unfortunately, young Keith had become competent so quickly that every word out of his chiseled mouth came tainted with an arrogant smugness that he couldn't hide no matter how hard he tried.	I've got it!
You think you're better than me? With your rock-hard abs, and your dynamite areolas? You're not.	Dr. Dorian, take my shirt.	No, Keith. All I need right now is a sip of your coffee to make me feel warm in my belly.Aww, Keith, look what you did!	Right on cue.
Those, Jason, are the panicked scratches of the adolescent raccoon. Though until animal control can get into my home, it's currently residing in my sock drawer.I got this! Start it, Grandma!	Dr. D, what's on your back?	You think you're better than me? With your rock-hard abs, and your dynamite areolas? You're not.	Dr. Dorian, take my shirt.
Keith, it's like you're begging me to hate you.	You OK, Dr. Dorian?	Ugh.	Hm?Mmhmm.Woohoo! That was close.
You can't stop, can you?	I don't feel like I am.	Keith, it's like you're begging me to hate you.	You OK, Dr. Dorian?
We were both a little edgy because our favorite patient, Mrs. Wilk, had developed a lung infection and needed to be intubated for a week. So basically, we had to put her in a coma. Of course, at her age, there's always a chance that she'll never wake up.	Newbie, today!	You can't stop, can you?	I don't feel like I am.
Everyone has their own way of getting stuff off their minds.Some like to work it off.Others try to drink it away.For me, I had heard that the piercing girl at the mall was easy.	Let's hope so.	All right. Here we go. See you in a couple days.	Changed my life.
Maybe later, you can show me where else you're pierced.	Mmhmm.	Thanks for penciling me in.	Everyone has their own way of getting stuff off their minds.Some like to work it off.Others try to drink it away.For me, I had heard that the piercing girl at the mall was easy.
All right.Ahh! Uhhg! Ahh! Uggh!I feel so close to you right now.HOOOOO!!	Why wait till later?	Maybe later, you can show me where else you're pierced.	Mmhmm.
OK, I should really go.You know what? I'll do it. If my partner in crime here will join me.	Hungry.	Oh, hey, you're up. Umm, look, I don't what you're looking for, but I just got out of a really tough relationship with this girl, Debbie. Also, my sister was carried off by a giant bird, so we've all been in mourning about that, and, um, my brother at my foot. But you were just fantastic. The things you were doing last night, they were, well, crazy. OK? Uh, so when I clear my own stuff up, I'd love to maybe get back together with you.	Cronk! Why you go now?
WAAH! Naked. Excellent. Who took my emerald?	So what now?	What?	Well, watch this.
Oh, I do love that show. It's like they've been watching our lives and then just put it on TV.	J.D., I really don't want to do this. Can't we just go home and put on our PJ's and watch Grey's Anatomy?	After paying the Janitor the unreasonable sum of $90 to move my bed back home......Elliot and I decided to round up out interns to pick out our respective booty calls.Welcome to Fugly-ville.	WAAH! Naked. Excellent. Who took my emerald?
Hmm.	Ha! Yeah.	Oh, I do love that show. It's like they've been watching our lives and then just put it on TV.	J.D., I really don't want to do this. Can't we just go home and put on our PJ's and watch Grey's Anatomy?
And then, Turk lied.	What do you want?	Carla listened at the door while I was helping Turk ask Dr. Kelso for new gym equipment.	Hmm.
I guess in the back of my mind, I was hoping for a pleasant surprise. Because around here, most of them are unpleasant. Like when a guy you thought you connected with, suddenly turns on you...	She's still the same.	Is there any change?	Sorry, baby. I tried.
I gotta tell you, I can't stand that guy.	I said no cream.I didn't say no cream. It's like having a sex puppy. What's your problem?	"El Toro Grande?" I'm not familiar with this brand.No change. Her FiO2 is still 50%.	I love booty calls. Ha!
I'd appreciate it if you did.	J.D., he's just a booty call. Say the word and I'll end it.	I gotta tell you, I can't stand that guy.	I said no cream.I didn't say no cream. It's like having a sex puppy. What's your problem?
Doug, I left a note on the decapitated guy's stump that I would have him back by two. It is 1:45.	There's Mr. Joy. J.D., did you steal him from the morgue?	Oh, way to get to know your patients, there, murderer.	I've never even seen this guy before.
All right, the real reason I brought Mr. Joy up here was for a teaching exercise. Can anyone figure out what the cause of death may have been?	Now I have to take him back down to the basement and I don't even have my gurney. I hate dead people.	Doug, I left a note on the decapitated guy's stump that I would have him back by two. It is 1:45.	There's Mr. Joy. J.D., did you steal him from the morgue?
What did you say Keith?	Maybe when you leaned over to check his IV, you smothered him with one of your love handles.	All right, the real reason I brought Mr. Joy up here was for a teaching exercise. Can anyone figure out what the cause of death may have been?	Now I have to take him back down to the basement and I don't even have my gurney. I hate dead people.
Well, I'm not.	Dr. Reid told me that if you picked on me, I should stand up for myself. And that you're very sensitive about your doughy physique.	What did you say Keith?	Maybe when you leaned over to check his IV, you smothered him with one of your love handles.
You know, Keith, I think out of professional decorum, we should refrain from talking about Dr. Reid. He's boinking her, everyone. That's why he gets special treatment. What did she say to do if I said that?	Please, no one help. He's not heavy at all.	Well, I'm not.	Dr. Reid told me that if you picked on me, I should stand up for myself. And that you're very sensitive about your doughy physique.
I am ashamed of you, OK, do you know petty it is to get that personal?Once, when we were dating, Elliot asked me to urinate on her.	Well, if the pear-shaped shirt fits, wear it!	Doughy physique, Elliot? Doughy physique?	Well, you know what bothers me? You whining about me being in your space when you're the one who never wants to be alone. I mean for God's sake...
Around here it can feel like good things never happen.	Dammit, I had been stung by a jellyfish!	I am ashamed of you, OK, do you know petty it is to get that personal?Once, when we were dating, Elliot asked me to urinate on her.	Well, if the pear-shaped shirt fits, wear it!
Did I say never?	Good morning, Dr. D. Dr. Reid told me to get my sweet ass out of the shower and make her an omelet. You want one?	Of course, when they do, all the petty little arguments fade away.And you don't mind waiting a little longer for your workout......Or your bar friend not being your work friend.Because the truth is, when you put stuff into perspective, the little things will never bother you again.	I'll catch you up later.
Totally.	Uh, you OK with us not hanging out for a couple of weeks?	And it was at that moment that Turk and I remembered the incident we managed to block out for 12 years.	Really? What guy drunkenly kissed you while you were sleeping?
I was going to miss Turk but luckily, my favorite intern was around to cheer me up: Jason Cabbagio. Or as I had brilliantly nicknamed him...	OK.	Totally.	Uh, you OK with us not hanging out for a couple of weeks?
Oh, no Mark, I wasn't talking to you. I was talking to Cabbage.	Yes, sir?	Cabbage!	I was going to miss Turk but luckily, my favorite intern was around to cheer me up: Jason Cabbagio. Or as I had brilliantly nicknamed him...
I know that, but I've nicknamed you "Wolfman" because of your keen sense of smell.	Well, my last name is Cabbage.	Oh, no Mark, I wasn't talking to you. I was talking to Cabbage.	Yes, sir?
Now, what can I do you for?	And your ridiculously hairy torso.	I know that, but I've nicknamed you "Wolfman" because of your keen sense of smell.	Well, my last name is Cabbage.
Well, yes and no, mostly no, really - really, all no. But don't worry, I got your back. First thing is, take a little nipper yourself.Oh, got some on you, look out! OK, that's some of the fun that you can have, but no , seriously watch and learn, watch and learn.	Dr. D, is the IV supposed to leak like this?	Now, what can I do you for?	And your ridiculously hairy torso.
Take it all in, Cabbage, take it all in.	It's an honor to watch you work, sir.	Well, yes and no, mostly no, really - really, all no. But don't worry, I got your back. First thing is, take a little nipper yourself.Oh, got some on you, look out! OK, that's some of the fun that you can have, but no , seriously watch and learn, watch and learn.	Dr. D, is the IV supposed to leak like this?
You're late, Keith! Which doesn't surprise me because you're a bad person.	Yes, I like some interns more than others, but I never let my personal feelings affect my professional behavior.	Take it all in, Cabbage, take it all in.	It's an honor to watch you work, sir.
Lies will get you nowhere, Keith.	Sir, they needed help with a shooting victim downstairs.	You're late, Keith! Which doesn't surprise me because you're a bad person.	Yes, I like some interns more than others, but I never let my personal feelings affect my professional behavior.
That could be anyone's blood.	I'm covered in his blood.	Lies will get you nowhere, Keith.	Sir, they needed help with a shooting victim downstairs.
Quiet time.	Yes it is.	That's not your blood.	Hey, look! My blood.
Winner!	Oh, J.D., this is so sweet.	Mrs. Wilk, I remembered how much you like basketball, so I got you a DVD of the NBA's "All Time Greatest Centers of All Time" signed by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.	That was a huge courtesy laugh, because I was about to trump Carla's goodbye gift like nobody's business.
Oh, is it, Keith?	My gift is in the same vein.	Winner!	Oh, J.D., this is so sweet.
Because, Keith, Cabbage is an ape enthusiast. Show him a little.It's like I'm at the zoo. Put the thing in your mouth, when you...Yeah!	Then how come Cabbage got Saturday off so he could go see King Kong?	Keith, I realize you'd like to be at your grandmother's funeral on Saturday, heck, we all would. But you can't just take a day off whenever you feel like it.	I want that bird gone.
What did you think of the Transylvania dream sequence? Because I wrote it while I was on call, and the next morning I woke up and read it and I was like "what was I thinking," you know?	I've seen that kid. Horrible doctor. I would sooner leave my medical care in the hands of Dr. Acula. Yes, I read your screenplay and as much as it pains me to say it, I didn't hate it. All right, lookit, here's what you gotta do with this Keith. You turn the heat up on his ass, and sooner or later he'll make a mistake and then you bounce him the hell out of here.	I'd sit with my interns, but Keith's over there and I can't stand him.	Why are you sitting here, Newbie?
Well, I can't just pick one of them out to torture.	Bethany. Focus.	What did you think of the Transylvania dream sequence? Because I wrote it while I was on call, and the next morning I woke up and read it and I was like "what was I thinking," you know?	I've seen that kid. Horrible doctor. I would sooner leave my medical care in the hands of Dr. Acula. Yes, I read your screenplay and as much as it pains me to say it, I didn't hate it. All right, lookit, here's what you gotta do with this Keith. You turn the heat up on his ass, and sooner or later he'll make a mistake and then you bounce him the hell out of here.
Actually, just this morning, one of them had trouble with an IV. Yesterday, one of them made a diagnosis off a backwards X-ray, and last week one of them make a patient septic when he confused a suppository with a Mike & Ike.	Then dump on all of them. I'm sure they deserve it, I mean let's face the facts. You are their teacher, how competent can they be?	Well, I can't just pick one of them out to torture.	Bethany. Focus.
When you get a chance, I'd love to talk to you more about the screenplay.	Stellar group there, Newbie, let the torturing commence.Oh, I'm sorry, that means conversational time is o-v-e-r. Please exit the area. Please exit the area. Please exit the area.	Actually, just this morning, one of them had trouble with an IV.

I think I know how to deal with people, Carla. Check this. Cabbage, heat test!	Wow. You know, Dr. Cox told me you were getting tough on your interns. I had no idea you were gonna go all cotton ball on their asses.	Uh- oh, Keith. It looks like someone's gone prematurely gray. That's gonna hurt with the ladies.	Identical twins, Turk!
I'll add some milk. Thank you. See?	It's a little hot.	I think I know how to deal with people, Carla. Check this. Cabbage, heat test!	Wow. You know, Dr. Cox told me you were getting tough on your interns. I had no idea you were gonna go all cotton ball on their asses.
And now, it's goodbye, Keith.	Yeah.	I'll add some milk. Thank you. See?	It's a little hot.
Please? I'm in the middle of a very threatening speech.	Not going to happen. I had to strangle a nurse to get this clicky-top.	Interns, gather! The next intern who screws up is going to be suspended for two weeks! This is a list of all of your names. At least the ones I remember. At the end of each day, I will either write a smiley face or a sad face next to your name. One sad face and you are gonzo, and I want to warn you, I write my sad faces pretty darn sad. Allow me to demonstrate. Dr. Cox, may I borrow your pen?	And now, it's goodbye, Keith.
Thank you. So as I was saying, my sad faces...	Return this pen or die painfully.	Please? I'm in the middle of a very threatening speech.	Not going to happen. I had to strangle a nurse to get this clicky-top.
Anyway, I know it's in pencil, but that's what a sad, two-week suspension face would look like, all right? Very, very sad. Yes?Who tried to give Mrs. Meadows an ACE inhibitor? She's six months pregnant, she could have lost the baby.	Excuse us for one minute, there, Devin, Eric, um. Hmm..	And if you feel your credibility slipping, you might have to excuse yourself for a moment.	Elliot, I gave it to you, you have the note, you give it to them.
Oh, Cabbage. Not you, Wolfman. Ugh.	That was me, sir. Sorry.	Of course, sometimes there's nothing you can do.	Anyway, I know it's in pencil, but that's what a sad, two-week suspension face would look like, all right? Very, very sad. Yes?Who tried to give Mrs. Meadows an ACE inhibitor? She's six months pregnant, she could have lost the baby.
No, I drove Cabbage out. That's Keith.	Why? You got what you wanted, you drove Keith out of here.	Nah, I'm just kind of sad about my intern.	You bested me again, you little chocolate bitch.
Oh, I don't have it.	That's Keith? That kid's the best intern we've got. Hell, I'd like to bronze him and turn my office into a Keith-edral and convert to Keith-stianity. F.Y.I., I still want my pen back.	No, I drove Cabbage out. That's Keith.	Why? You got what you wanted, you drove Keith out of here.
What's not over?Do you know what's not over?	You damn sure better find it, Newbie, and when you do, I want it buffed, shined and de-nerdified.You think that's funny? This isn't over.	Oh, I don't have it.	That's Keith? That kid's the best intern we've got. Hell, I'd like to bronze him and turn my office into a Keith-edral and convert to Keith-stianity. F.Y.I., I still want my pen back.
Cabbage is back! Gang, I should have made it clear, earlier. The suspension policy begins today at 4PM. So, my apologies to Cabbage.	And now, to take care of my boy.	You're gonna be an awful father!	Get over here, boy! You come over here and give your father a hug!NOOOOOO!!!!Dude, you all right? You were gone for a really long time.
You get in there!	That's OK, Dr. D.	Cabbage is back! Gang, I should have made it clear, earlier. The suspension policy begins today at 4PM. So, my apologies to Cabbage.	And now, to take care of my boy.
Let me explain something to you, Keith, OK? I treat each and every one of you like unique individuals, OK? Take Gloria, for example, she's 400 years old. She needs to sleep a lot. I work around that schedule.Wolfman has gotta be home by daybeak, so he does all of his work come nightfall. Crazy Barry. Not allowed near children. We work around that.	This is totally unfair! If I had messed up, I'd be gone.	You get in there!	That's OK, Dr. D.
Not everyone's last name lends itself to a nickname, Keith.	How come I don't get a nickname?	Let me explain something to you, Keith, OK? I treat each and every one of you like unique individuals, OK?

Not allowed near children. We work around that.	This is totally unfair! If I had messed up, I'd be gone.
And what am I supposed to do with that? OK, I'm not a magician.	My last name is Dudemeister.	Not everyone's last name lends itself to a nickname, Keith.	How come I don't get a nickname?
You see, Dr. Cox, I treat each and every one of my interns differenly...	Ruh? Why is that screw-up still here?	Those are beautiful antlers.	Hey, Newbie!Watch out for the bedpan. Now we're even. But answer me this one question, will you please?
that nickname will never stick. It's too long.	And, you're done. So, you accidentally drummed your friend out of here because you were trying to eighty-six the Dudemeister, eh?	You see, Dr. Cox, I treat each and every one of my interns differenly...	Ruh? Why is that screw-up still here?
OK, this sucks. But at least I didn't forge a note from a dead father.	Yeah, you do.	I don't remember who made those mistakes.	Hey. Dr. D, is the IV supposed to leak like this?I'm not quite sure what I'm looking at here.Don't worry. You're going to feel much better after I insert this suppository.
Oh!	Oh, really?	Hey, Todd. My buddy, Keith, here, says you're no good at rat-tailing.	Time to give Keith, here, a little treat.
Oh, he's good, Keith. Really good.	Yeah! There! Tell him I'm good!	Oh!	Oh, really?
Yeah, about coming back...	I know what you're going to say. I really am suspended for two weeks. But I promise, I'll do much better when I come back.	Hey, Jason, uh, we need to talk. Look, you're you're not progressing as fast as the other interns, and you've been making a lot of mistakes lately.	Hey, Dr. Dorian.
Mostly, because they never let me speak.	You saw him do it, didn't you, Paco?	Frankly, the whole thing disgusted me.	Liar!
I hate the pickers' bunkhouse.	Paco, you can't talk because you lost your tongue in that cider press accident last year, remember? Now back to the pickers' bunkhouse!	He hid them in his pantalones. He loves these apples. He makes apples pie, and apples juice with them.	Mostly, because they never let me speak.
Still, she was sick, so we couldn't go far.	I'm going to miss the feel of sand between my toes.	And I hate Keith. Which begs the question: why do I insist on being a part of their foreplay?I guess I needed a distraction because last week we all thought Mrs. Wilk was going home, but she got an infection. Despite our best efforts, she was now going to die. To make her happy, we decided to take her to the beach.	I hate the pickers' bunkhouse.
I thought we had more sand.)	Aw, shut up and move the Sunbrella, will you? I'm freckling.	Want me to bury you?	Still, she was sick, so we couldn't go far.
Take it away, Coxy.	That was the ending to Cocoon.	Oh, oh, uh, OK, yeah, um...OK, death is like a journey. Uh, a journey in a boat, and uh, then this giant light shines down on, on your "boat," and um, um, it carries you up to the heavens.	All right, we will. Newbie, go.
"We?" He said "we." After all these years, he's finally made us a team!	Listen up. We don't need any of your head-shrinking.	I was tempted to take him up on it, but then Dr. Cox said something.	I understand you guys spend most of your time fighting death around here, so it's it's understandable that you're made uncomfortable by this. Now, if you'd like, I'm willing to counsel both of you.
Easy. Now is not the time to discuss the Dorian-Cox clinic, Much less the relocation to Jacksonville.	What?	Yeah, Hedrick! If it was up to us, we never even would have called you! We can handle death just fine! We might even be going into private practice together.	"We?" He said "we." After all these years, he's finally made us a team!
Oh, I tried to, Perry, but I'm having some scooter trouble.	Hey. I thought you went home already.	I was hunting for bigger game.	Keep moving, C-Bear.
I was in the Porsche. I had never made it into the Porsche. It smelled like German heaven. I wasn't gonna blow this opportunity. I had to be careful about every little	Come on, I'll give you a ride. Let's go.Can you believe the huevos on that Hedrick? Holy cow, it's like we've never had a patient die on us before. Uh, I gotta put this bag in the trunk.	Oh, I tried to, Perry, but I'm having some scooter trouble.	Hey. I thought you went home already.
Apparently you're not familiar with the John Dorian three tap method. Three taps and the foam goes bye-bye.Works every time.Oh. Ahhh! The quickest way to my house is to take Elm.	Don't open that soda. It's been rolling around on the floor for months, it will explode.	Hey, a root beer!	I was in the Porsche. I had never made it into the Porsche. It smelled like German heaven. I wasn't gonna blow this opportunity. I had to be careful about every little
Coming to you, Mr. Johnson.	Are you done with my arms?	The good news is it looks like he has a soft face.	If he keeps ignoring my threats I I'm gonna have to hit him.
Yeah, is that what it is?	All right, Lester! We are having this out, right here, right now!Oh, for the love of God. What is this, some pansy, get-in-touch-with-my-feelings-because-my-mommy-didn't-love-me group?	Yeah, you're right. Still a little sticky. Not yet ready for passengers.	Dr. Cox and I decided to give Hedrick a piece of our mind. Unfortunately, I had lost front seat privileges.
Oh, we should probably go.	Actually, this is a support group for the terminally ill.	Yeah, is that what it is?	All right, Lester! We are having this out, right here, right now!Oh, for the love of God. What is this, some pansy, get-in-touch-with-my-feelings-because-my-mommy-didn't-love-me group?
That guy looks fantastic. What do you think he's dying of, a case of the handsomes?	Yeah, Newbie, what do you got?	Dr. Cox.	Oh. Good.
It's too much, I know.	No!	We love it.	Don't ever get sick and tired of that, it is awesome being that.
We'd been there before when someone died. But this felt different.	Should be any minute now.	And that was the moment it got real for Elliot.And for Dr. Cox and me.	Oh, Elliot! You like him!
We were definitely in the depression stage. And bless Hedrick, he didn't say it. All he said was...	She's gone.	We'd been there before when someone died. But this felt different.	Should be any minute now.
Letting go is never easy.Whether it's letting go of the leverage you had over your boss...	She was lucky to have you two as doctors.	We were definitely in the depression stage. And bless Hedrick, he didn't say it. All he said was...	She's gone.
She was.	She was a great old gal.	But there's nothing more difficult than letting go of someone you cared about.	I'd love that.
That's the rhododendron, Keith, everybody knows they smell like pie when they bloom.	Does it smell like pie crust?	Keith didn't know I mildly disliked him. He also didn't know I was rubbing Crisco on his back.	Oh, God, no.
Thank you!	Hey, nice new watch, J.D.	That's the rhododendron, Keith, everybody knows they smell like pie when they bloom.	Does it smell like pie crust?
Come in, brown bear.	It wasn't a watch. Now that Elliot had gotten serious with Keith, I needed to get tighter with Turk. And since he's so busy being married and trying to have a baby, I had only one option.	Thank you!	Hey, nice new watch, J.D.
I got us watchie-talkies	Come in, brown bear.	It wasn't a watch. Now that Elliot had gotten serious with Keith, I needed to get tighter with Turk. And since he's so busy being married and trying to have a baby, I had only one option.	Thank you!
That's not my handle.	Hey, white shadow.	I got us watchie-talkies	Come in, brown bear.
Right on. Hey, what are you doing, man? I'm about to take out the slip and slide. Let's do it.	Hey, Gizmo.	That's not my handle.	Hey, white shadow.
Awesome, check this.	Dude I can't.It's baby-making time. How's it going with Keith?	Right on. Hey, what are you doing, man? I'm about to take out the slip and slide. Let's do it.	Hey, Gizmo.
Yes, Rex?	Dr. Dorian?	It's just too much. Sorry, I switched places so I could go again.	It's way too much.
Mrs. LeVinne has dementia, Rex, and I know she loves sweets. So take the pill, put it in some raspberry jam, put it on your finger, dip it in her mouth, helloo!	Uh, Mrs. LeVinne won't take her medication.	Yes, Rex?	Dr. Dorian?
No problem, brown bear. Are you nude right now?	Hey, Gizmo, can you check on Mr. Jensen for me?	It really is unfair, you guys!	So unfair.
Because your voice is always higher when you're nude.	Yeah! How did you know?	No problem, brown bear. Are you nude right now?	Hey, Gizmo, can you check on Mr. Jensen for me?
I was just glad to watch TV and for once, not be in a world of crap.	Ohhh....	You firing blanks, buddy?	Oh, honey, stay calm. Nobody knows but us.
Or not.	Why didn't you stand up for me?	I was just glad to watch TV and for once, not be in a world of crap.	Ohhh....
Not reading you, Brown Bear! I repeat, are you still sterile?	Uhh, can't talk about that right now, I'm in an elevator.	How did you do that?I'm having a rough morning, Brown Bear, how you doing with your sterility?	Oh, looking for this?
Waah! I'm hit! I'm hit!	Huah!	Come in, Brown Bear, come in Brown Bear. If you're around, I'm having some java out front.	They're kielbasas.
Well, you're in luck. This happens to be my specialty. Here's some tips. If you can't get over the fact that you're doing it to yourself, sit on your arm until it falls asleep, then pull it out and use that. I call it "The Stranger."	You know I'm not comfortable getting busy with myself.	Of course, buddy.	All right, look. I know I said I wanted to go by myself to get tested today, but I've been doing some thinking and I'm scared. So, it'd mean a lot if you went with me.
I can't believe you're ready to have kids. We spend all day taking care of old people, washing them, cleaning them, why would you want to bring that home?	If I ever have kids you are never allowed to babysit.	Well, you're in luck. This happens to be my specialty. Here's some tips.

All right, fellas, two quick announcements! First of all, whoever's been filling up my Tivo with JAG reruns, let's cut it out. Secondly, Harvey, no matter how drunk you get, I like to sleep alone.	J.D., we're talking about kids. Not going home to a house full of old folks.	I can't believe you're ready to have kids.

All right, if you like him, I like him.	Thanks again, Dr. D.	You're right, Lisa, it is too late, because from now on, I'm going to be handing out all the case assignments. For instance, this cool case right here.Should I give it to the most annoying intern? Because that would be you, Lisa. Or maybe I should give it to the most incompetent intern missing a finger, because that would be you Rex. Or maybe I should just give it to the best intern, which would be you, Keith.Now if anyone wants to tell on me, to whomever they like, they can. Good day.Here you go.	It's too late, Dr. Reid.
Congratulations!	Hey! I'm not sterile!	All right, if you like him, I like him.	Thanks again, Dr. D.
My friends were all happy. And even though I felt like the fifth wheel, I could take solace in something.	Turk's not sterile!	Congratulations!	Hey! I'm not sterile!
I had finally won one.	Mmm? Oh. Oh-ho ho. I'm gonna kill him.	Oh, hey, Turk. I forgot, I can't raid the freezer with you.Be careful in there, they lock it up at three.	My friends were all happy. And even though I felt like the fifth wheel, I could take solace in something.
Sometimes you gotta go the extra mile with patients. That's what makes me such a special doctor.	My job is to make sick people better, not to help Bernie in there score a slice of Episcopalian tail on opening night.	Why didn't you just read lines with the old guy?	What page are you on?
Oooh.	That, and your amazing ability to switch back and forth seamlessly between male and female genitalia.	Sometimes you gotta go the extra mile with patients. That's what makes me such a special doctor.	My job is to make sick people better, not to help Bernie in there score a slice of Episcopalian tail on opening night.
Personally, me, I believe that medicine is about more than just treating the disease. You gotta be there for people. Take Mrs. Cohen, right? When she broke her hip I treated that, but she had also left her car double-parked, so being an "extra mile" kinda guy, I went and took car of it.Sorry. It's been a little while since I drove stick.I wonder how she got out of that truck. That's how she broke her hip.	Newbie, snap out of it. I don't have time for your daydreaming.	Oooh.	That, and your amazing ability to switch back and forth seamlessly between male and female genitalia.
It didn't bother me that Dr. Cox just "Kelly Rippa'd" me because I knew it would never catch on, no matter how much he wanted it to. This, however, did upset me.	I'm a *good* doctor. Kelly Rippa!	You can confide in me.	Look, Newbie, there's a reason I can't go the extra mile with patients. It's something personal.
Yes, but the good news is it's very treatable. We just have to get started right away.	What?	Uh, Carol, we got the bone marrow biopsy back and, uh, I'm afraid you have leukemia.	It didn't bother me that Dr. Cox just "Kelly Rippa'd" me because I knew it would never catch on, no matter how much he wanted it to. This, however, did upset me.
All right, I'll find somebody else.	She's already watching someone for me.	Carla, can you cover my patients?	Mr. Sommers is a cousin of one of the trustees. Not important enough to warrant any face time with me, but connected enough that if one of those ding-dongs kills him, it will be my ass.
Uh-oh. Carla's gearing up to explode. Save yourself. Attempt a casual side-switch.And you're there. Now angry at Kelso.	Mr. Barry, I misplaced your chart, I forgot, what's wrong with you again?Oh, that's right, you have a kitty-cat stuck in your mouth.Or should I say you have a person stuck around you, little guy? Gootchie, gootchie.It's not like nurses know everything.	Carla knew that without their charts, doctors didn't know much about their patients.	J.D., why don't you tell me whats wrong with your patient, Mrs. Jones?Without looking at her chart?
Bob, how dare you?	Uh-oh. Carla's gearing up to explode. Save yourself. Attempt a casual side-switch.And you're there. Now angry at Kelso.	Mr. Barry, I misplaced your chart, I forgot, what's wrong with you again?Oh, that's right, you have a kitty-cat stuck in your mouth.Or should I say you have a person stuck around you, little guy? Gootchie, gootchie.It's not like nurses know everything.	Carla knew that without their charts, doctors didn't know much about their patients.
All right, team, let's stay close. Come on. Carol! Look who I found!	Get a load of Mr. Extra-Mile-Guy's leukemia patient sitting there all by herself. Knowing him, he's probably out getting her a cake shaped like a cancerous white blood cell.	I hoped you learned something today.	Exactly, Flo, exactly.
Well, right after I got your test results back, I got on the horn with your dad and we started a phone tree to find everyone. There were some tears, mostly mine, but we got it done.	Larry? Dad? How...?	All right, team, let's stay close. Come on. Carol! Look who I found!	Get a load of Mr. Extra-Mile-Guy's leukemia patient sitting there all by herself. Knowing him, he's probably out getting her a cake shaped like a cancerous white blood cell.
Hear that, Perry? I'm the most amazing doctor because I went the extra 5280 feet. What's that? That's right, it's a mile. And how does that make me feel? Keith!Thank you.	You are the most amazing doctor.	Well, right after I got your test results back, I got on the horn with your dad and we started a phone tree to find everyone. There were some tears, mostly mine, but we got it done.	Larry? Dad? How...?
And I told you I never get dizzy!OK, let me tell you guys why we're here. Carol is starting a journey, OK? Obviously the chemo is gonna be tough, but we're all here for you. Anything you go through, we go through together.	I told you not to call me Lawrence.	EAGLE!	Carol's family had welcomed me as one of their own. No more so than her brother, Larry.
...or as on the ball as you thought.	Fourth?! I'm fourth!	Life in a hospital is constantly humbling. Whether it's making you realize you're not as skilled as you thought...	This is a preliminary ranking of your technical skills. So, whenever you get a chance.
Pause for effect. Pause for effect.	I'm going to go take care of that man and when I come back...	God bless his herpes.	Dr. Dorian, we need you. Mr. Bentley's condition is getting worse.
We're gonna shave this thing.	Pause for effect. Pause for effect.	I'm going to go take care of that man and when I come back...	God bless his herpes.
I'm hiding. I really don't want to be bald. I have a sneaking suspicion it won't work for me. It think it might accentuate my spoon chest.	How's that leukemia patient of yours doing?	I don't think it's funny.	I told you it would catch on.
Plus, the girl I'm dating is totally into my hair.	Mm.	I'm hiding. I really don't want to be bald. I have a sneaking suspicion it won't work for me. It think it might accentuate my spoon chest.	How's that leukemia patient of yours doing?
There is, even if she won't admit it. You know what, I'm stuck, man. I have to shave this down.	No, there's nothing else.	I'm sure there's something else she's into.	If it weren't for your hair, I don't think I'd be remotely interested in you.
That was a long time ago. Maybe you should listen to me for once.	No you don't. You don't have to go the extra mile. That's what I've been trying to tell you. What the hell happened to the days when you used to listen to me?	There is, even if she won't admit it. You know what, I'm stuck, man. I have to shave this down.	No, there's nothing else.
Thank you.	Not in this lifetime. Listen, Newbie, you're not a completely terrible, horrible, incompetent doctor and while I would never let any of my blood relatives be your patient, if it was someone that I knew, an acquaintance, I might be OK with you treating them.	That was a long time ago. Maybe you should listen to me for once.	No you don't. You don't have to go the extra mile. That's what I've been trying to tell you. What the hell happened to the days when you used to listen to me?
She'll be OK. She has all you guys.	What about Carol?	Oh, Larry, man, I don't think I can shave my head.	Hey, where you been?
Oh no, that's Nana.	Dude! There you are. Two things, first, the aliens are here and they're wearing track suits.	Date time.	Whew.Whoa! Nana, how you doing? Looking hot in the track suit. Gym's on the second floor.
Nice.	Oh. Second, I got a job.	Oh no, that's Nana.	Dude! There you are. Two things, first, the aliens are here and they're wearing track suits.
Woo! Ah. Where were we?	And if you hadn't pushed me to do all of that extra mile stuff, that probably wouldn't have happened. So, thank you. You got a hottie waiting for you at the bar. You go get her.	Nice.	Oh. Second, I got a job.
That's one of my conditioners, yes.	Do I smell banana conditioner?	Woo! Ah. Where were we?	And if you hadn't pushed me to do all of that extra mile stuff, that probably wouldn't have happened. So, thank you. You got a hottie waiting for you at the bar. You go get her.
AAHHH!	As great as this was, I couldn't stop thinking about what Turk said and howWhoa, this girl really digs hair. The point is, it's hard getting what happens at the hospital out of your head.	That's one of my conditioners, yes.	Do I smell banana conditioner?
See, that's the thing about and extra mile guy. You never know who it's going to rub off on.	Voila!	I knew if I didn't leave that bar and go back, I'd never be able to enjoy any of the simple things. Even a woman eating my former bangs.	Not helping with the stress.
All right, I'll count. Close a brother up.	I know. It is now my turn to hide.	How bad would she look with red highlights?	Hee hee hee hee!
But the thing you shouldn't toss out is a pregnancy test that takes two minutes longer than you thought.	OH! Oooh! Schoenen busen.	Some things deserve to get tossed out on their asses.	If you would raise my allowance, I wouldn't have to bargain shop so I could buy pizza rolls. Secondly, this pregnancy test works just as well as the name-brand one!Wait a second. Results in three minutes.
Ohh...	I I didn't sleep with Amy Carter. We did everything but.	No. No more. Here are some of the lies you've told us over the last five years: You went to Harvard. You have a wife who only has a pointer and thumb-pinky. You have a a brother-dad, a mother-sister. You have two kids, no wait, you have one kid, no wait, you had a baby with a Chinese local, you're a deaf-mute, oh wait, now you're telling us that you're a world class hurdler and you slept with the beautiful and irreplaceable Amy Carter?	Good race.They offered me a full ride and Grambling, but then I slept with the President's daughter. Not the college president, the President of the United States. But, hey, if Amy Carter asks you out for a nightcap, you do not say no.
We're not buying it, are we gang?	And I really was a world-class hurdler.	Ohh...	I I didn't sleep with Amy Carter. We did everything but.
The people have spoken. Allow me to bask in the glow.	No, nah, heck no...	We're not buying it, are we gang?	And I really was a world-class hurdler.
Not now, Turk, I'm glow-basking.	Oh-ho! J.D., guess what?	The people have spoken. Allow me to bask in the glow.	No, nah, heck no...
Uh, Carla, preggo!	OK, you go	Why don't I tell	What's going on?
This won't be indoors, Turk, and there certainly won't be all those people throwing bird seed. Why were people throwing seed? It's a the point is that you, my friend, have a chance to be on the greatest surprise a husband has ever pulled for his wife. And you get credit for it the length of your entire marriage.	Are you forgetting what happened when you made me have doves at my parents' anniversary party?	Wait, Turk! When has a man ever been able to tell his wife that she's pregnant? Allow me to paint you a picture with my imagination brush, OK? You two come out in the parking lot where all Carla's friends have gathered. They're holding a giant banner that says "Carla, you're pregnant, and I dove you." Did I say "dove?" I did, Turk. That's when I cue the bird-wrangler who releases 500 white doves into the air. Where do they land? I don't know. But one thing Carla knows is that in her uterus is a little, soft, baby Turk.	I haven't told her yet. I'm gonna go tell her now.
Great, I'll tell everybody. You find Carla. Dr. Cox	I'm in!	This won't be indoors, Turk, and there certainly won't be all those people throwing bird seed. Why were people throwing seed? It's a the point is that you, my friend, have a chance to be on the greatest surprise a husband has ever pulled for his wife. And you get credit for it the length of your entire marriage.	Are you forgetting what happened when you made me have doves at my parents' anniversary party?
And Elliot, if you see Carla, don't get emotional.	Fine.	Can you just please not tell Carla?	Ever since I was blitzkrieg'd this morning by an enraged German named Otto, a certain Dr. Barbie no longer exists for me. So, if she was to ask me a question, I wouldn't be able to hear it, and you'd have to repeat it.
Really? Baby.	Oh, no problem.	And Elliot, if you see Carla, don't get emotional.	Fine.
Yeah, I pissed him off earlier today. How am I supposed to avoid him?	Hey, what's up with the Janitor? He seems a little more lurky than usual.	I already have a grandma.If I get one this little, everyone's gonna think I'm gay.Aw, look at this fellow. Come here boy, I got a little hard candy for you.Yes, you're a good boy. You got a candy you can unwrap in a movie theater!I'd name him Sebastian.	He's not good with people.He's great, but we don't want to separate them.
It would take a very clever plan to hide this tiny, penny-like sensor on him.	You should put the hide and seek sensor on him. That way you'll always know where he is.	Yeah, I pissed him off earlier today. How am I supposed to avoid him?	Hey, what's up with the Janitor? He seems a little more lurky than usual.
Spilled mine, too.	I spilled mine, too, honey. You know what you should do? Ask for some of J.D.'s.	I felt like Turk was starting to blame me for all of this.	Turk, I think the answering machine is broken. And I don't think we have any more wine. Can I have some of yours?
What are you going to do?	I'm going to bed.	Spilled mine, too.	I spilled mine, too, honey. You know what you should do? Ask for some of J.D.'s.
Wait, Turk! I have an idea.	I'm gonna go tell her the truth and hope that she's so tired from being pregnant that she doesn't have the strength to kick my ass for more than a few hours.	What are you going to do?	I'm going to bed.
It's a good 'un.	You have another idea, huh? I gotta tell you, I'm done with your ideas. And not just for now, but forever. OK, are we clear on that?	Wait, Turk! I have an idea.	I'm gonna go tell her the truth and hope that she's so tired from being pregnant that she doesn't have the strength to kick my ass for more than a few hours.
OK, we need Carla to find out she's pregnant on her own and we need your help. Can we count on you?	I'm listening.	It's a good 'un.	You have another idea, huh? I gotta tell you, I'm done with your ideas. And not just for now, but forever. OK, are we clear on that?
Unpleasantly.	Unpleasantly.	Really? Because I think you're both very close to Carla, aren't you? And yet you chose not to tell her she was pregnant. Turk how would that go down for them?	You can't blackmail us.
Actually, I need to come with you.	OK. That was right.	You go left.	Heh, we'll see about that.
Uh, she went up to the roof to get some air.	Where's Carla?	Actually, I need to come with you.	OK. That was right.
Follow her. Lock her up there.	Oh.	Uh, she went up to the roof to get some air.	Where's Carla?
Hello, Janitor, waiting around the corner to grab me.	You got it.	Follow her. Lock her up there.	Oh.
I'm holding a GPS warning device that goes off whenever you come within a hundred meters of me. It's responding to a tiny sensor in your stomach.	How'd you know that was me?	Hello, Janitor, waiting around the corner to grab me.	You got it.
You'll never get anywhere near me.	I knew that wasn't a penny.	I'm holding a GPS warning device that goes off whenever you come within a hundred meters of me. It's responding to a tiny sensor in your stomach.	How'd you know that was me?
Yeah, we will see.	We'll see.	You'll never get anywhere near me.	I knew that wasn't a penny.
The only thing left to do? See.	Oh, we're gonna see.	Yeah, we will see.	We'll see.
We'll see.	You're going to pay.	The only thing left to do? See.	Oh, we're gonna see.
OK, bye.	No time.	We'll see.	You're going to pay.
I was a little anxious because it was tie to change Mr. Beeper's batteries. All clear to the left, all clear to the right. You can do this.	Hey. Dr. Dorian, I got those batteries you asked for.	I don't know, I'll have someone from the psych ward check her out.	What's she yelling about?
As I lay there, watching Nurse Roberts hammer-throw 23 pounds of high end fruit my way, I could take solace in one thing.	He's 100 meters away, and it's going to take him at least ten seconds to change those batteries. That's not even a world record pace. Ready, set, go.Time!Still got it.	I was a little anxious because it was tie to change Mr. Beeper's batteries. All clear to the left, all clear to the right. You can do this.	Hey. Dr. Dorian, I got those batteries you asked for.
Any second now, Carla and Turk were coming to tell me they were pregnant. Carla had to believe that I was truly surprised.I was the lynch pin of our plan. Showtime.	We're having a baby!!

What's the scoop? I would have no clue what it could be.	Hey, J.D. We have such big news!	Any second now, Carla and Turk were coming to tell me they were pregnant. Carla had to believe that I was truly surprised.I was the lynch pin of our plan. Showtime.	We're having a baby!!
Oh!	We're having a baby!	What's the scoop? I would have no clue what it could be.	Hey, J.D. We have such big news!
Carla, when Turk first told me, I	Now give them the ten minute emotional roller coaster ride that is the speech you've been practicing all afternoon.	Oh!	We're having a baby!
Oh boy.	What do you mean "when Turk first told you?"	Carla, when Turk first told me, I	Now give them the ten minute emotional roller coaster ride that is the speech you've been practicing all afternoon.
What would you have thought of doves?	Uh...We've known for a day. That pregnancy test you took yesterday was positive. Yeah, I wanted to have everybody at the hospital gather outside and surprise you with balloons and stuff.	Oh boy.	What do you mean "when Turk first told you?"
Yeah, we are.	Who cares? We're having a baby. We're having a baby!	Then I witnessed one of those moments that let me know in my heart that these two would be together forever.	So everybody already knows?
Praise be to Krishna! Dammit.Hey, Mr. Coleman, how are you feeling?	Good morning, Dr. Dorian.	After our tambourine jam they gave me some literature, but I'm not the type that's easily sucked in by that stuff.	Hare Krishna Hare Krishna...
Um, Mr. Coleman, the hepatitis is doing a number on your liver. You're obviously very jaundiced...yellow! Oh, mellow yellow, I get it, that's funny! You know, I never knew what that song was about. Now I now I finally get it. Liver disease. Anyway, we're going to give you suppressive therapy and do everything we can to make sure you don't need a liver transplant, OK?	They call me mellow yellow.	Praise be to Krishna! Dammit.Hey, Mr. Coleman, how are you feeling?	Good morning, Dr. Dorian.
All right, see you, Mr. Coleman.	OK.	Um, Mr. Coleman, the hepatitis is doing a number on your liver. You're obviously very jaundiced...yellow! Oh, mellow yellow, I get it, that's funny! You know, I never knew what that song was about. Now I now I finally get it. Liver disease. Anyway, we're going to give you suppressive therapy and do everything we can to make sure you don't need a liver transplant, OK?	They call me mellow yellow.
Frank, we have no more options. We gotta get you a new liver.	Let's hear it.	Unfortunately, a month later...	All right, see you, Mr. Coleman.
Marc was a stand-up comic on a cruise ship.	Hey, somebody order a liver? Ha ha ha! Uh oh. Jello? Jello? Is this thing on?	The amazing thing about livers is that a healthy person can actually have part of it removed and give it to somebody else. For Frank, that person was his brother, Marc.	All right, buddy. Today's the day.
He was a genius.	If I'm not careful, they'll put me in the pun-itentiary.	Marc was a stand-up comic on a cruise ship.	Hey, somebody order a liver? Ha ha ha! Uh oh. Jello? Jello? Is this thing on?
I do, Carla. I'm building something.	You better have a reason for taking my man's badonka-donk donk.	I didn't either. Hey, Turk, if you ever donated a body part to me, you know which one I'd want?Hey, thanks for the butt, playa!	I didn't get that one.
A brick house!	What?	I do, Carla. I'm building something.	You better have a reason for taking my man's badonka-donk donk.
You mean we are off. I changed my schedule which means I have Thursday nights off which means we are going out which means you are going to be my wingman. Even though you're horrible at it.	Dude, four more hours and I am off.	You know, you could be a dynamite center square.	How does he come up with this stuff?
Turk, are you sure this isn't offensive? It doesn't look like anybody else is wearing a costume.	When have I been a bad wingman?	You mean we are off. I changed my schedule which means I have Thursday nights off which means we are going out which means you are going to be my wingman. Even though you're horrible at it.	Dude, four more hours and I am off.
All right.	Buddy, relax. These are my guys, all right? As long as you're with me, they're going to find this funny.	Turk, are you sure this isn't offensive? It doesn't look like anybody else is wearing a costume.	When have I been a bad wingman?
Wazzup!Waaaah!!	That looks like Talia.	All right.	Buddy, relax. These are my guys, all right? As long as you're with me, they're going to find this funny.
Wooo! Ahh!	My bad, my bad.	Wazzup!Waaaah!!	That looks like Talia.
Every time I saw them they yelled out "cracker." How did they know I love crackers?	That that wasn't Talia.	Wooo! Ahh!	My bad, my bad.
We'll be rooting for you.	All the best.	Good luck fellas.	Wish us luck guys!
And I will see you later.	Good luck.	We'll be rooting for you.	All the best.
And bowled a gentleman's 40. Now, who wants to help me off with my shoes? I forgot to wear socks.I'm losing them.	That's how we do!	It's great. You surround yourself with some new friends. You say one clever thing and you're in. Watch this. You guys, let's tally it up, gather round! Whoa, Carol! 180, amazing! Lisa, you had a 125. Turk, 192!	I can't believe people hang out at bowling alleys now.
Nice save.Krishnas.	If you ladies remain in this area, we'll bring back drinks.	And bowled a gentleman's 40. Now, who wants to help me off with my shoes? I forgot to wear socks.I'm losing them.	That's how we do!
You look great, man, I'm glad.	I feel I feel great.	Look at you, man, you're color's back, there's no sign of infection.	Oh.For the next twenty minutes, you will sit in silence while I tell you why the Detroit Red Wings are the greatest franchise in the history of professional sports. On September 25, 1926...
Unfortunately, things weren't going as well for Marc.	Thanks.	You look great, man, I'm glad.	I feel I feel great.
Sometimes that's the way life works. The ones who do the nice things suffer the most. Whether it's giving up Turk Night for a friend...	He's hypertensive and tachycardic.	Unfortunately, things weren't going as well for Marc.	Thanks.
When you're the one paying the price it can really make you wonder...	Hi!Oh, come on!	...or agreeing to be the bad guy for your boss.	Oh my God.
...was it worth it?	He's bleeding out. Prep the OR. CAN I HAVE THE CRASH CART IN HERE!!	When you're the one paying the price it can really make you wonder...	Hi!Oh, come on!
You're going. Where are the interns?	You know what? Thursday night might not work for me.	Sounds hot. Hey, we're going out Thursday, right? Because I went online and got a magic eight-ball bowling ball. Check this: Are the ladies going to love this? "Ask again later?" Oh, I'm just kidding, it says yes.	The Martin Luther King Fling?
What?!	They're with Dr. Cox. Apparently he's mentoring them and talking to them and stuff.	You're going. Where are the interns?	You know what? Thursday night might not work for me.
No! Zip it! I am so G-darn pissed right now. I was OK when you kept me at an arm's length because everybody said "that's just Cox. That's how he operates." And I believed them. Now I walk in on this. This bi-racial love fest? You know what? I hate to do it, but I'm giving you back the pencil. That's right. The pencil you gave me on my third day of work. You handed it off to me like a like a tiny yellow baton. Like you were trying to say to me "J.D., you are the new me. You, J.D., are my mentee. You are my son."	Newbie...	Oh. My. God.	I might have an answer for that: Ew. I mean come on, children, what do you actually think is going to happen here? Do you think I'm going to take you and sit you down next to me and say, uh, "listen, um, if you need anything......you've got my pager. Just know that I'm there for you, always."
Oh, that's perfect.That's perfect. You know what, take it!Maybe you can use it with Rex, or Gloria, or that guy.	What pencil?	No! Zip it! I am so G-darn pissed right now. I was OK when you kept me at an arm's length because everybody said "that's just Cox. That's how he operates." And I believed them. Now I walk in on this. This bi-racial love fest? You know what?

Heh. His name is Leslie. His name is Leslie. You're name is Leslie. All right, good for you, Leslie.LESLIE!	That guy's name is Leslie.	Oh, that's perfect.That's perfect. You know what, take it!Maybe you can use it with Rex, or Gloria, or that guy.	What pencil?
Cheers.	Me too.	I'm having a great time, man.	Uh, reggaeton.
Carla's pregnancy also affected Elliot.	Ahh, I think the children in pediatrics would love this little fella. Ha ha!	Carla being pregnant had changed everyone. It made Dr. Kelso softer.	Diseased rodent should be nowhere near my pregnant princess.
Well, who cares, Lonnie. Because all that really matters is whether or not America loves it.	We don't love it.	Thanks for your opinion, Carla. But I'm much more interested in what you all think.	You know what, I'm not sure that suit works on you.
He's a dynamite tailor. Not sure why he's here.	For the last time, it's Americo. And of course I love it. I made it!	Well, who cares, Lonnie. Because all that really matters is whether or not America loves it.	We don't love it.
How you doing, buddy?	You better put your scrubs on, Herbert's back.	He's a dynamite tailor. Not sure why he's here.	For the last time, it's Americo. And of course I love it. I made it!
How you feeling, love bug?	Because of his weight, Herbert was a frequent visitor and no one liked treating him.He wasn't a mean thing. See, with big people, even the simple stuff is more difficult. I didn't mind, because Herbie was my man.	How you doing, buddy?	You better put your scrubs on, Herbert's back.
Herbie, it's not a bath house.We'll get those bandages off later today, Mr. Brooks, all right	Fully loaded. Hey, it's time for my sponge bath, right? I need three girls...	How you feeling, love bug?	Because of his weight, Herbert was a frequent visitor and no one liked treating him.He wasn't a mean thing. See, with big people, even the simple stuff is more difficult. I didn't mind, because Herbie was my man.
Life was good, but then came a surprise visit from my brother, and a round of the game he likes to call "Watch her leave."	You look like you need to be rescued.	And just like that, I had the chance to comfort Claire.	You turned me down fourteen times for drinks. Well, who's the creepy loser now, huh?
Yes, she was, Dan. Thank you. We'll be right back.	There's no easy way to say this. We've got the crabs.Oh, she was cute.	Life was good, but then came a surprise visit from my brother, and a round of the game he likes to call "Watch her leave."	You look like you need to be rescued.
Well, OK.	I call him Coxsmith.	Don't call him Coxsmith.	That does not count as a formal hello, Coxsmith.
Hey, I paged you because I can't figure out what's going on with Herbert. He's got acute back pain and no cauda equina signs.	Nothing.	What's up my negro amigo?	Oh, and if you mention the names to anyone, they'll ruin them for us, so don't tell anyone, OK? No one.
That Dan train used to hook up with Elliot.	What?	Thanks a lot, dude.	Dan train. Woo woo!
Look, Dan doesn't exactly have the world by the tail, OK? Every time he calls me all depressed, the only thing I can think of to cheer him up was to say "Elliot still digs you." I'm just trying to find a way to make him feel good about himself, you know?	What? I mean it tickles.	Doctor-patient confidentiality goes both ways, Mr. I-Prefer-My-Temperature-Taken-Through-the-Back-Door.	So? Man, your boy J.D.'s been telling him that Elliot still likes him.
What about Tiger?	If we have a boy, we're gonna name him George.	Look, Dan doesn't exactly have the world by the tail, OK? Every time he calls me all depressed, the only thing I can think of to cheer him up was to say "Elliot still digs you." I'm just trying to find a way to make him feel good about himself, you know?	What? I mean it tickles.
Oh boy.Call Elliot...call Elliot...No. N Call Elliot...got her...	Hey, man, where'd your brother go, anyway?	What about Tiger?	If we have a boy, we're gonna name him George.
As long as you're not my brother.	Mr. Brooks wanted some safety tips on how to safely operate propane heaters.	Hey, Mr. Brooks, let's get these bandages off you.What are you doing here?	Now that Dan knew that Elliot wasn't in to him, my focus had shifted from keeping him away from her, to avoiding him so he doesn't kill me.
Yeah.	I had a brother once. Well, I shouldn't say once, he's still my brother. My parents adopted him when I was about 12. He was about 46. Actually older than my parents. His name was Cleat. And he talked like this. Howsitgoin? Howsitgoin? Good kid. Did what they said. Make the bed, mop the floor, sweep the lawn, whatever had to be done. Everything was good till he was in his fifties, and then, wow, did he have a midlife crisis. Him and my dad fought constantly. And I mean, really, physically beating on each other. But I don't blame him for it though. I blame my mom for sleeping with him. That's just out of line.	As long as you're not my brother.	Mr. Brooks wanted some safety tips on how to safely operate propane heaters.
Watch what?	Anyway, the reason I'm telling you this is because your brother told me that if I could keep you focused on me, he would let me watch.	Yeah.	I had a brother once. Well, I shouldn't say once, he's still my brother. My parents adopted him when I was about 12. He was about 46. Actually older than my parents. His name was Cleat. And he talked like this.

But I don't blame him for it though. I blame my mom for sleeping with him. That's just out of line.
WAAAAHHH!!	Hey, little brother.	Watch what?	Anyway, the reason I'm telling you this is because your brother told me that if I could keep you focused on me, he would let me watch.
Me too. Angie, guys?	I love it!	I guess I could help you name her. Let's see. It's a girl hamster, what about Angie?	Ah-ah... Where did you come up with that name?
Angie it is.	Yeah!	Me too. Angie, guys?	I love it!
Wait, Turk, it was an accident, OK? The name just popped into my head!	Hold his arms!	Angie it is.	Yeah!
No! Turk!	Shut up!! You just shut up right now! Pink belly.	Wait, Turk, it was an accident, OK? The name just popped into my head!	Hold his arms!
Uh, Turk was so proud of his handiwork that he signed it.I think he knows it's so painful I won't be able to wash it for some time.	The best I could do, man. How's your tummy?	So, Herbert, how you doing with your diet, man?	Why the hell not?
Actually, we were. Because the way the whole brother thing works, now that Dan had beaten me up, it was all over.	Hey, man, y'all two OK?	Uh, Turk was so proud of his handiwork that he signed it.I think he knows it's so painful I won't be able to wash it for some time.	The best I could do, man. How's your tummy?
Or not.	WHY DID YOU LIE TO ME ABOUT ELLIOT?!	Actually, we were. Because the way the whole brother thing works, now that Dan had beaten me up, it was all over.	Hey, man, y'all two OK?
The obvious response was that Elliot was looking for a guy with more going on in his life. And the only way to gently break that to my brother was this:	Why wouldn't she be into me?	Oh, come on, man, a girl like Elliot could never be into somebody like you.	Or not.
Elliot, the last time I was honest with Dan about his life it just made him feel like crap. And he didn't talk to me again until our dad died. Do you really want me to do that? Because I'm not sure what would get us back together this time. Dad can't die again.	J.D., just tell him the truth.	My brother is on his way up. You have to tell him that the only reason you don't want to be with him is because he doesn't want kids right now.	'Sup, J.D.?
And like that, he was gone.	Yup. Get my stuff.	All right, man. Say hi to Mom for me.	I got a good feeling about those two. Well, I'm off.
I know what you're all thinking, but I'm not going to do that to Herbert, it's too humiliating.	Nobody wanted to say it, but sometimes when hospitals have Herbert-sized patients they'll send them to the one place that has MRI machines big enough: the zoo.	OK, guys, let's all gather round, huddle up. Now, you guys, Herbert in there needs an MRI, but he won't fit into our machine. Does anybody know what we should do?	Yeah. I gotta vomit first.
Spare me the tough love speech, all right? You really think that going in there and being mean to Herbert is going to cause him to turn his life around and lose 100 pounds?	He's been in here seven times, all for weight related problems. I mean, he's never even tried to get healthier. Sometimes protecting someone's feelings isn't the best way to go.	Why do you hate Herbert?	Damn.
I do, but I want to talk to you about something.	Hey, Johnnie. Just packing up. Thought you had to work?	Hey, Dan?	Yeah, I thought he was gonna learn how to tie knots.
Elliot doesn't want to have babies with Keith.	Yeah, what's up?	I do, but I want to talk to you about something.	Hey, Johnnie. Just packing up. Thought you had to work?
When I said Elliot would never be into a guy like you, it's because you're a 35 year-old bartender who still lives in our mother's attic and is showing no signs of changing. I'm not saying this to make you feel bad, Dan, I'm telling you this because I think you have the potential to do whatever you want to do with your life. But you have to actually try.	Huh. Tough break for Keith. You know, I almost had a threesome with that guy.	Elliot doesn't want to have babies with Keith.	Yeah, what's up?
Even though I knew my brother wasn't going to change, Elliot was right. It comes down to what helps you sleep at night.	Don't you have to get back to work?	And then I got the answer I expected.	When I said Elliot would never be into a guy like you, it's because you're a 35 year-old bartender who still lives in our mother's attic and is showing no signs of changing.

Whether it's a sense of denial......or the fact that you love your son.As for me, I was just happy to get some rest.	Who are we kidding? This is so real now, there's no way we can sleep!	Even though I knew my brother wasn't going to change, Elliot was right. It comes down to what helps you sleep at night.	Don't you have to get back to work?
You know what, man, you might as well just keep it.	Hey, Johnnie, is it cool if I borrow this suit? I figured I might wear it to that job interview.	Hey.	Whether it's a sense of denial......or the fact that you love your son.As for me, I was just happy to get some rest.
I think you can do whatever you want to do.	Yeah, I'll keep it. Hey, uh, you think anyone would ever really hire me?	You know what, man, you might as well just keep it.	Hey, Johnnie, is it cool if I borrow this suit? I figured I might wear it to that job interview.
Not Optimus.	No, he wouldn't.	No, he wouldn't.	That's Optimus Prime, and I don't think he'd appreciate you calling him the big, ugly one.
Whoa! We should probably take a break.	I think you're just jealous because your mom's dead.	Turk gets defensive when it comes to his mother.	What do you mean "did?" J.D., last Christmas I walked in on Turk and his mom cuddling in bed.
Thank you.	You go this time.	I can't get this crib together. And would somebody please bring me a glass of water?	But, baby, it's too soon to be putting a nursery together, or test driving minivans, or buying baby monitors.
Lonnie.	Morning, weirdo.	Thinking about Turk and Carla becoming parents made me think about my own mom, and how much she probably misses me. I bet she wishes she could see what life is like around here through my eyes.And that's why I strapped my video camera on top of my head.	Thank you.
I even got some great footage of Dr. Cox.	Sorry, the old man stole some ice cream.	It was the perfect idea. She got to meet my superiors.	Lonnie.
I'm making a video postcard. Do you have a message for my mom?	Where the hell have you been?	I even got some great footage of Dr. Cox.	Sorry, the old man stole some ice cream.
She had a hysterectomy last month. I'm sure I can just edit over that part.	No, but since she brought you into this world, I have a message for her uterus.Bad uterus! Don't do that anymore.	I'm making a video postcard. Do you have a message for my mom?	Where the hell have you been?
Mr. McNair had locked-in syndrome. A paralysis so severe that he could only communicate through a computer that responds to his eye movements.	Let's go see Mr. McNair.	She had a hysterectomy last month. I'm sure I can just edit over that part.	No, but since she brought you into this world, I have a message for her uterus.Bad uterus! Don't do that anymore.
Now you're being a jerk...jerk...jerk...jerk! JERK!	Oh my God. I get it now. Carol...Carol...Carol...Carol...Carol...	Oh, thank you for asking, Mr. MacNair. You see, the thing about Dr. Cox is the closer he feels to a person, the more he means to push them away. So when he calls me Ava, he's actually saying "J.D., I care about you." Vulnerable people, like...	Why does he call you a girl's name?
What?	Newbie!	Now you're being a jerk...jerk...jerk...jerk! JERK!	Oh my God. I get it now. Carol...Carol...Carol...Carol...Carol...
My bad.I felt bad for Mr. McNair, but I was off until six tonight, so I decided to grab a quick nap in the sun.What the...whoa!	I'm relatively certain the computer is broken.	What?	Newbie!
Cold.	How was your day?	WAAAHHH!	Uh, 6:00.
Even though the Janitor had basically kidnapped me, when he helped me up, I couldn't help but feel there was hope for our relationship yet. I guess being locked up all day really make you appreciate the things that really matter...	Now help him up so he thinks there's hope for our relationship yet.	Cold.	How was your day?
You called my bluff, and today isn't soup and frozen yogurt day, it's actually salad and smoothie day.	Ah, just give me a spoon, will you please?Oh, for goodness sake.	Because it's ludicrous.	Lunch for us, not going to happen. Normally, I'd tell you something harsh right about now, like "we're not friends," but then you'll just grin that stupid grin and shake your head back and forth, like "how could that possibly be true?"
Lookin' good pal, eggs on top, OK? Eggs on top.	Hey there, Dr. Dorian.	Some doctors like to change into their streets when they go out for lunch. Not me. I like how the world reacts to me as a doctor. Whether it's a friendly greeting from the world's slowest bagger...	I think I may vomit.
Hey, Rebecca, you got that echinacea for me? Just kidding, you know I think all this stuff is voodoo. Good to see you. Hey, looks like somebody else is sick of that cafeteria stuff, huh?	...Or a smile from the manager of the herbal section.	Lookin' good pal, eggs on top, OK? Eggs on top.	Hey there, Dr. Dorian.
A friend dropped me off.EAGLE!Hey, wanna go splitsies on some deli counter meatloaf? I can't finish a whole serving. I mean I can, but I don't like to. It all goes right here.	Aw, now what the hell, do you follow me here?	Hey, Rebecca, you got that echinacea for me? Just kidding, you know I think all this stuff is voodoo. Good to see you. Hey, looks like somebody else is sick of that cafeteria stuff, huh?	...Or a smile from the manager of the herbal section.
Oh, we have to get back to the hospital.	Oh my God, what are you doing here? I was supposed to meet a guy for a date. I know what you're thinking, a Tuesday lunch date at the supermarket? He is so not into her. Well guess what? He's not!I waited for an hour just thinking "how many more guys from my yoga class can reject me before just saying enough,"	Yes, it could be more of a nightmare. Jill Tracy was a former patient who had once tried to kill herself. Sad, yes, but this did not change the fact that she was unbelievably annoying.	Guys!
Security?	Security!	Oh, come on, Rebecca, everybody's doing it.I won't tell anyone if you don't.	You know that's stealing.
I don't think there's a security force at...OK, hey fellas.	We've got a grazer.	Security?	Security!
Where's the shaving cream, is that aisle two, still?	Ha ha! Wherever you're taking him, take me, too! Nah, you go ahead.	I don't think there's a security force at...OK, hey fellas.	We've got a grazer.
I had one objective: Pick up everyone's lunch at the grocery store and get out of dodge.	You feel more like a pastry, a very doughy pastry. I don't feel good about that. Way too easy.	I do feel like a sandwich.	Sorry, go step up Davey's dialysis to take your mind off of it.Newbie, you feel like a sandwich?
Hey, Jill.	J.D.!	Whoa!	I had one objective: Pick up everyone's lunch at the grocery store and get out of dodge.
Mmm.	How weird is it that we're both here two days in a row?	Hey, Jill.	J.D.!
It's not not sad.	I was thinking there might be a 50% chance that the guy who blew me off yesterday just got his days wrong and would be waiting here with roses. Is that sad?	Mmm.	How weird is it that we're both here two days in a row?
That's an awesome story, Jill.	Plus I have the whole day free. My shrink couldn't make our appointment. He found his third wife in bed with his second wife and got so depressed that he downed an entire bottle of his bulimic daughter's Prozac. So now he's back in the hospital.	It's not not sad.	I was thinking there might be a 50% chance that the guy who blew me off yesterday just got his days wrong and would be waiting here with roses. Is that sad?
Stay away from my organs!	Because we'll probably just go ahead and sell this one.	Ah, what the hell. I can live with one kidney.	Yeah, this will do.
Having lunch. The cafeteria stinks and I can't go to the grocery store because apparently crazy Jill Tracy lives there. Every time I try and shop she follows me around, like I'm her only friend in the world. It's pathetic.	Dude, what the hell are you doing?	Stay away from my organs!	Because we'll probably just go ahead and sell this one.
I'll come, too.	I'm gonna go talk to Carla.	Having lunch. The cafeteria stinks and I can't go to the grocery store because apparently crazy Jill Tracy lives there. Every time I try and shop she follows me around, like I'm her only friend in the world. It's pathetic.	Dude, what the hell are you doing?
She had been, uh, stood up on a couple dates. And, uh, she hadn't seen her shrink in a while. She was definitely depressed.	She was admitted a short time ago and she hasn't regained consciousness. Tox screen's positive for cocaine.Do you think she could have OD'd?	Sure, what's going on?	Dr. Dorian? Can you help me?
She told me.	How do you know all that?	She had been, uh, stood up on a couple dates. And, uh, she hadn't seen her shrink in a while. She was definitely depressed.	She was admitted a short time ago and she hasn't regained consciousness. Tox screen's positive for cocaine.Do you think she could have OD'd?
...It probably means bad news for another.	People, I've got our organs.	...He's probably gay.And if there's good news for one doctor...	No, why?Oh, he's glistening.
Thank you.	You can use her organs.	...It probably means bad news for another.	People, I've got our organs.
No.	Just tell me this: Is there anything anyone could have done?	Thank you.	You can use her organs.
God, this girl's annoying.	What's that?	You know what I was thinking the whole time I was havig lunch with Jill?	Vintage Cox.
Why?	I saw her in that supermarket, too, but I'm not torturing myself. Would you like to know why?	God, this girl's annoying.	What's that?
OK, I hear you.	Because she didn't come to the hospital looking for help. We just randomly bumped into her out here in the world. I mean, don't get me wrong, if a guy gets shot, or if he has a heart attack and I am physically the closest doctor to him, I will intervene. But shy of that, you can't. I mean, you just can't. It's too much to ask of yourself.	Why?	I saw her in that supermarket, too, but I'm not torturing myself. Would you like to know why?
And because he said that, I knew it wouldn't.	No, you don't. Once you start blaming yourself for deaths that aren't your fault, my friend, that's a slippery slope that you can't come back from. And trust me, I've seen it ruin a hell of a lot of good doctors and I will not let it happen to you.	OK, I hear you.	Because she didn't come to the hospital looking for help. We just randomly bumped into her out here in the world. I mean, don't get me wrong, if a guy gets shot, or if he has a heart attack and I am physically the closest doctor to him, I will intervene. But shy of that, you can't. I mean, you just can't. It's too much to ask of yourself.
I guess that lunch was kind of a one-time thing, huh?There's no way you could have seen that coming. I mean, rabies? Come on, there's, like, three reported cases a year. In fact testing for it would have been irresponsible. You would have wasted time those people didn't have.	No.	Hey. Hungry?	We did everything we could over the next few days to keep the transplant patients going, but odds were against us.First we lost Mrs. Sikes......And then Mr. Dennison.And I knew that Dr. Cox needed me the exact same way I needed him earlier.
You had to be. The fact is, those people were going to die in a number of hours and you had to make a call. I would have made the same call.	I was obsessed with getting those organs.

Yes. Now I got us lunch. And I think we should eat it.Right then I knew I was going to pull him out of this. But unfortunately, sometimes the hospital picks a day where it's just going to pile it on.	Yeah?	You had to be. The fact is, those people were going to die in a number of hours and you had to make a call. I would have made the same call.	I was obsessed with getting those organs.
Where are you going? Your shift's not over. Hey! Remember what you told me? The second you start blaming yourself for people's deaths...there's no coming back.	Oh, God. Come on.Clear!Still in V-tach, clear!Come on. VF, Clear!Aw, come on. Come on, Come on! GOD! GOD, GOD!He wasn't about to die, was he, Newbie? Could have waited another month for a kidney.	Yes. Now I got us lunch. And I think we should eat it.Right then I knew I was going to pull him out of this. But unfortunately, sometimes the hospital picks a day where it's just going to pile it on.	Yeah?
Uh, I would have, Mr. Catay, but Dr. Reid is throwing a huge celebration for you later.	Why aren't you guys making a bigger fuss?	...Or nobody remembering Ray Catay's eightieth birthday.	Right after I put some drops in.
Let us not feel sorrow for Bobby Adams. He was 12. He lead a full life. He will be missed, especially by his beautiful wife, Jenny, who stood by him even when he turned 6 and had a midlife crisis and was caught banging one of those naked people who brought us corn.I'd be the oldest man in pilgrim village.	I should tell her about that. The truth is, with modern medicine, 80 isn't that big a deal anymore. It's not like the olden days.	Uh, I would have, Mr. Catay, but Dr. Reid is throwing a huge celebration for you later.	Why aren't you guys making a bigger fuss?
Still, you should always celebrate life, because you never know when it's going to throw you a curve ball. Like with Dr. Cox. He recently made a decision any doctor would have made and because of it, three patients died. At first, he was inconsolably sad.After that, he started acting out.

Oh, no.	Newbie, will you give me a little trouble? I'm having some help here.	Yup, he's the best damn doctor here.	OK. Well, make sure to put antiseptic on any puncture wounds, OK? Now, I know Dr. Cox seems crazy mad at the world right now, but let's remember. Three patients died. What's amazing is that he can take a hit like that, one that would knock the rest of us out for good, and come out the other side still standing. That's why the man's an inspiration. I mean, he is a rock.
Always pass, sir.	Well, standing invitation, every Thursday.	Pass.	You fellows want to go to a real donkey show? It's really very tastefully done. I understand one of the women who entertains the donkey used to be on a soap.
Turk, you know what bothers me? Dr. Cox shows up to work drunk and we're all acting like nothing happened.	Well, uh, I'll ask Mickhead.	Always pass, sir.	Well, standing invitation, every Thursday.
Turk was psyched because orthopedic surgeons are notoriously the most unemotional, jockish surgeons of all.He was finally going to have a boss he could connect with.	I don't know, I kind of feel for the guy. Besides, I am way too excited. I start my orthopedic rotation today. It is going to be awesome.	Turk, you know what bothers me? Dr. Cox shows up to work drunk and we're all acting like nothing happened.	Well, uh, I'll ask Mickhead.
Well, you hug me all the time.	I'm just not into all of that sensitive, touchy-feely stuff.	That's pretty lame.	He actually said "I think that's pretty special." Then he got all emotional. How lame is that?
A grand slam!	Ha! What a game!	You're sports team's in the World Series!	Yeah!
Turk was right. Personal feelings shouldn't get in the way of a professional relationship. But they do.	Nah, it'll blow over. Plus, he's a surgeon, and surgeons don't hold grudges. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go scrub up. And by the way, your shift with Dr. Cox starts in ten minutes.	You gonna go talk to Dr. Stone?	It doesn't look cancerous. Eh, get in there and take your pants off.
I can help you with Dr. Stone. He's one of my people. He's a sensy.	I'm never gonna get a good surgery on this rotation.	I'm just not down with the whole drinking and doctoring thing, OK? Excuse me.	...sunshine all over the place, just put on a happy face! Yeah!
It's short for sensitive guy. Our music is acoustic alternative. We marvel at fireflies. And when we help a drunk girl home from the bar, sure we cop a feel. A feel of her hair as we're pulling it back so she doesn't get any vomit in it.	What's a sensy?	I can help you with Dr. Stone. He's one of my people. He's a sensy.	I'm never gonna get a good surgery on this rotation.
I did! That was our last year! I didn't what you to get Jagermeister in your corn rows.	I'm having a weird med-school flashback. I think you held my hair back while I vomited.

Dammit.	Basketball.	Hockey?	My Latrell Sprewell phase.
You're gonna cry in front of him.Laugh if you must, but it'll show him you have emotional depth and it will trigger a nurturing impulse inside him that we sensies can't resist.	What am I gonna do about Dr. Stone.	Dammit.	Basketball.
Oh, I'm using it for the final death scene in my movie, Dr. Acula. Last night, my German financier, Hans, rest in peace, died on the Autobahn. So now I gotta shoot the whole thing on my cell phone.	Why do you have five of them?	Anywho, don't worry about crying. I got this menthol from the pharmacy. I read online that actors in Hollyweird actors spray it in their eyes when they need to fake cry.	You need to cry, let's brainstorm. I could hit you over the head with a wrench. Or, I could stab you in the gut with a knife.Knife-wrench! Practical and safe.Waah! OH! Ohh! Oh boy. Ahh!
No!	Oh, yeah, I forgot all about that crying stuff. I was just...Oh, hey, loose thread.	OK, there he is. You ready?OW! He's the one who needs to cry, you idiot, not me!AAAHHH!!	She made me watch.
OK, he's hugging Colonel Doctor, which means you got about seven seconds.	Got it. Knife-wrench! For kids.	No!	Oh, yeah, I forgot all about that crying stuff. I was just...Oh, hey, loose thread.
A good one does. Here's the plan. What you're gonna do is tell him a story that isn't inherently sad. That way, when you get all emotional, he's gonna think you're extra sensitive. At which point, I'm gonna nail you with the menthol and you'll be crying like a ten year old pilgrim widow. Here he comes. And, blacktion.	A hug takes seven seconds?	OK, he's hugging Colonel Doctor, which means you got about seven seconds.	Got it. Knife-wrench! For kids.
He's your attending, you have to connect with him. You need somebody you can look up to. Someone you can count on. What you need is someone who will always have your back.	Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. That's it. I'm done. There's no way he and I are going to have a relationship. Not unless I want to bear his seventeenth child.	Good. That gives us time to come up with a new plan.	Old habit.So, he has a mild concussion, and they're going to let him rest for awhile.
Right then I knew what I had to do.	No, J.D., that's what you need. That's what you've always needed. Maybe after five years of working here, that's not such a good thing anymore. I gotta go and do my shift with Dr. Cox.	He's your attending, you have to connect with him. You need somebody you can look up to. Someone you can count on. What you need is someone who will always have your back.	Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. That's it. I'm done. There's no way he and I are going to have a relationship. Not unless I want to bear his seventeenth child.
You're probably wondering why I didn't show up before, huh? I know you wanted me to, even though you'd never admit it. Normally I would kill to get into this apartment. And you try and keep me out. I say try, because at your Superbowl party, which I was not invited to, I was lucky enough to be able to watch the second half from right over there. I was the bearded Domino's employee you invited in because I said I was a fan of Jerome Bettis, who ever the hell that is. Anyway, I tried to convince myself the reason I didn't come earlier was because of you coming into work drunk. But that's not it. I was scared. I guess after all this time, I still think of you as like this superhero that will help me out of any situation I'm in. I needed that. But, that's my problem, you know? And I'll deal with that. I guess I came over here to tell you how proud of you I am. Not because you did the best you could for those patients. But because after 20 years of being a doctor, when things go badly, you still take it this hard. And I gotta tell you, man, I mean, that's the kind of doctor I want to be.	What's up.	Hey.	Right then I knew what I had to do.
Ohhh, that's awful.	You don't drink scotch.	Maybe he just needed time to heal, or maybe he just needed to see how much everybody cared but I like to think that it was because of me that he was finally able to say this.

That's the thing about family. When you fall off the deep end, you can always count on them to rally around you. When you come back, you might get a quick hug, a pat on the shoulder......Maybe just a nod.But no words really need to be spoken. Of course, it's always nice when they are.	Glad you finally shaved.	Ohhh, that's awful.	You don't drink scotch.
Welcome.	J.D....Thank you.	That's the thing about family. When you fall off the deep end, you can always count on them to rally around you.

Uh, no, you big knucklehead, I don't. On behalf of everyone here at Sacred Heart, I'd like to say konnichiwa.	J.D., I'm sure you know Kim Briggs.	Hello!	Hmm, Turk talking to a new staff member. Give her a treat and say hello.
I know that, Kim. It's a game we play. What's your name? It's Turk. What's that guy's name? I don't know, he's a patient. Looks like a Dave. Are you a Dave? Maybe he's a Dave, we don't know. Hey!	I've been here five years, big guy.	Uh, no, you big knucklehead, I don't. On behalf of everyone here at Sacred Heart, I'd like to say konnichiwa.	J.D., I'm sure you know Kim Briggs.
Please, T, I'm not that shallow.	Yes.	] Everybody was Kung-fu fighting! Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah!So you're saying because she wears a wedding ring she's invisible to me?	Kim was here on your first day.She was at Ben's funeral.She's been around.
Dr. Feinburg? Anastasia? Gift Shop Girl?	Oh, really? Will all the women in the room who are married, please remove your wedding rings?	Please, T, I'm not that shallow.	Yes.
I thought you died.	Hey, J.D.	Dr. Feinburg? Anastasia? Gift Shop Girl?	Oh, really? Will all the women in the room who are married, please remove your wedding rings?
But I sent your family flowers.	Nope. I just got married.	I thought you died.	Hey, J.D.
Gift Shop Girl!	I know. You bought them from me. It was kind of weird.	But I sent your family flowers.	Nope. I just got married.
Sorry.	What?Stop that!	Gift Shop Girl!	I know. You bought them from me. It was kind of weird.
She even got along with the greasers.	I just love that every woman knows how to do that.	All the women liked her.	Thanks, Todd.
I never got a synchronized snap from the greasers.	Guys, I know everyone gives you a hard time, but trust me. This look is coming back.	She even got along with the greasers.	I just love that every woman knows how to do that.
WHAT?!	Mr. Peters, I know that having a gal urologist might seem a little uncomfortable, but the penis is just another excretory organ, so let's go ahead and take the stigma off it. Now this is the length of the average penis.	I never got a synchronized snap from the greasers.	Guys, I know everyone gives you a hard time, but trust me. This look is coming back.
Well, I'll have to come by sometime.	I'm at the Giggle Pit. Every Monday at sunup.	Where do you perform?	Hey, Dorian, let me borrow that pencil for a second. Just one second? Thank you.Oh no. I snap-a da pencil. What do you think? It's for my stand-up act.
No, wait a second, I'm mad at you! You stole my video camera with all the scenes on it from Dr. Acula, the vampire movie I'm making.	Do it, man.	Well, I'll have to come by sometime.	I'm at the Giggle Pit. Every Monday at sunup.
I don't know, maybe I was surfing the hospital's website and I saw that someone posted the "Dr. Acula delivers a baby, then eats it" scene? Someone with the screen name "Rotinaj?" Rotinaj is just Janitor spelled backwards, Rotinaj.	Why do you think I stole it?	No, wait a second, I'm mad at you! You stole my video camera with all the scenes on it from Dr. Acula, the vampire movie I'm making.	Do it, man.
I don't mind it a turtle's wink.	Anyway, I hope you don't mind your new middle initial.	Hm.	This is goodbye for us, but I'm leaving you in the very capable hands of Dr. John D. Dorian. You take care.I gave you a new middle initial. It reassures me for some reason. In my mind, the D stands for Dallas because I just got finished telling Mr. Peters that's where I lost my virginity. Don't know how we got down that path, it's something about that old man that just makes me want to open up.
Quick as a porcupine's hiccup.	Could you lend me your pen?	Wait, you only pepper your conversations with cute animal imagery if you're smitten.	I don't mind it a turtle's wink.
Kim, wait. Unfortunately there's no way I can make you mine. Unless I make you mine...for eternity!	OK. See you J.D.	All right, there's only one problem with this.	Quick as a porcupine's hiccup.
Vampires like it windy.	Dr. Acula, don't....stop!	Kim, wait. Unfortunately there's no way I can make you mine. Unless I make you mine...for eternity!	OK. See you J.D.
Your melon-size prostate, sir?	Do you know the difference between me and you, Dorian?	Don't let him in your house, sir. He'll steal everything you got, like he stole my video camera.	I'll do it. I shouldn't be mopping in here anyway. This is a rug.
Wait, Kim's single?	And you know how hard single life can be. Just ask Kim.	Relax, brown bear, there's no shame in cry-maxing.	Baby!
Turk! Keys!Yahtzee!Hey, girl. What are you doing? Wanna get some coffee later?	Oh, yeah. She's been divorced for like, over a year. She just wears her ring at the hospital so she doesn't get hit on all the time.	Wait, Kim's single?	And you know how hard single life can be. Just ask Kim.
Even if it meant losing respect for someone you thought you might like.	Surgery is really the only thing that has a shot at curing this guy and the reason that she's not going to do it is because he's older and he's got heart issues which makes him high-risk and if he were to drop dead on her operating table, well, that would make her surgery stats go down. And that wouldn't look very good on a young doctor's resume, would it?	Still, it's always good to hear the truth.	Mmm, I don't think it's any business of yours.
Damn.	What can I say? You got me.	Even if it meant losing respect for someone you thought you might like.	Surgery is really the only thing that has a shot at curing this guy and the reason that she's not going to do it is because he's older and he's got heart issues which makes him high-risk and if he were to drop dead on her operating table, well, that would make her surgery stats go down. And that wouldn't look very good on a young doctor's resume, would it?
It bothers me that a doctor wouldn't help a patient so she could keep her stats up.	Non-threatening, colloquial greetings?	Don't "Hey, dudes" us, you know what bothers me?	Hey, dudes.
Oh, my God. Out of here!Dr. Cox, please weigh in.	Actually, I have done that. Everyone has.	Well, my best friend here is a surgeon and he would never pass on a risky surgery just to keep his stats up.	Look, J.D., surgery is competitive. We do what we have to to get ahead.
Now back to the crux of the matter! Hit her, Per!	Well, it's no secret how I feel about surgeons. I hate them. I would liken them to rocks, but that would be an insult to rocks, because you see, at least rocks are useful to society. We build bridges with them. We throw them at guys who wear those tiny phones clipped to their heads. It's a phone. You can't do this? However...	Oh, my God. Out of here!Dr. Cox, please weigh in.	Actually, I have done that. Everyone has.
Yes, please.	Blacker.	Because it's my movie! Now let's take it from the top and I'm not gonna ask you again. Blacker.	You ain't takin' no more blood from my ho-slappin' hand. I will pimp slap you. This feels a little racist, J.D. Why can't I be a vampire?
The irony was that Keith was yelling at the one woman who was trying to save his relationship.	It was really cool getting to know you, man.	Nobody really speaks to Carla like that.	Whoa, whoa, OK, that's enough! I don't know what you two are fighting about, but it doesn't matter. Because no one is allowed to be that mean to my girlfriend, especially when all she's trying to do is apologize! Are we clear?
And even more ironic was that it looked like she had.	I'm sorry, Elliot.	The irony was that Keith was yelling at the one woman who was trying to save his relationship.	It was really cool getting to know you, man.
Yeah, well, it's just...	Look who's happy again.	I think Elliot finally seeing who Keith really was made me understand why I was so upset with Kim.	Yeah, totally.
I finally figured out what bothers me so much about you.	J.D., one second, uh, I'm on the phone with my Mom.She just got her RV fixed. Mom, I gotta go. You can call me from the road.My mom loves the road.	Yeah, well, it's just...	Look who's happy again.
It's the way you're so concerned about protecting yourself. I mean, no one in this entire hospital has a bad thing to say about you, and I'm guessing that's because you're so careful not to rub anyone the wrong way. And you still wear your wedding ring. That prevents any guy from getting anywhere near you. You wouldn't operate on Mr. Peters, and we both know you're protecting yourself there. I don't know, I guess in the grand scheme of things, it's not that big a deal. I just I was a little disappointed to find out how you turned out to be. I'll see you around, Kim.	Well, lay it on me, studly.	I finally figured out what bothers me so much about you.	J.D., one second, uh, I'm on the phone with my Mom.She just got her RV fixed. Mom, I gotta go. You can call me from the road.My mom loves the road.
Then why did you do it?	No, actually it was a stupid career risk.	I saw you did that surgery on Mr. Peters. Did you decide it was the right thing to do?	And good luck. I love that movie.
Oh. Cool.	Because for some reason, I find myself really caring about what you think of me.	Then why did you do it?	No, actually it was a stupid career risk.
Dr. Kelso celebrated spring by wearing his golf shorts to flaunt his oddly youthful legs.	She's out in the car with the cats.	Where's your mom?	Bank foreclosed on my house.
You zoom, zoom, zoom?	I'd rather just go out with you. Ohh! Zoom, zoom, zoom!	Hey, Kim, how would you like a night on the town with the hottest doctor in this place?	Yup, love was definitely in the air.
Oh, cool.	Ha! Of course. I invented the zoom, zoom, zoom.	You zoom, zoom, zoom?	I'd rather just go out with you. Ohh! Zoom, zoom, zoom!
Help the poor kid out.	So, Josh, you are suffering from a condition called phimosis. It's basically a hardening of your foreskin. As part of your treatment, I'm going to ask that you masturbate five times a week.	Liar.	Oh, cool.
He said, in front of his future girlfriend.	Well, five times a week, huh? For me that would be cutting back.	Help the poor kid out.	So, Josh, you are suffering from a condition called phimosis. It's basically a hardening of your foreskin. As part of your treatment, I'm going to ask that you masturbate five times a week.
You know what? I should probably mosey.Looking forward to our date.	He said, in front of his future girlfriend.	Well, five times a week, huh? For me that would be cutting back.	Help the poor kid out.
That's mine.	See you around six, wear something slutty. Zoom, zoom, zoom.	You know what? I should probably mosey.Looking forward to our date.	He said, in front of his future girlfriend.
Ooh.OWWWW!!	Oh, J.D., come here, I want to you to feel something, quick!	Hey, Tubby.	I know, and I'm loving it.
Pregnant witch. Hey, there's Kim. She and Elliot had bonded over their ability to communicate at the speed of light.You'd have to slow it down for humans to understand.	Don't call me Tubby.	Ooh.OWWWW!!	Oh, J.D., come here, I want to you to feel something, quick!
Too late, I'm already there.	J.D., not Floating Head Doctor.	We are not going the mall, Elliot. I was gonna make you dinner and then go to karaoke, but I'm not sure how to do both in the same night. Unless, of course...	Ah, yes. The best thing about having a date with J.D. is that if you're having Chinese food and you decide you want Mexican, you can just walk right on to the other side of the food court.
I couldn't if I tried.	Don't go breaking my heart.	Body could stay home and prepare the feast.And as always, Head could take care of entertainment.	Too late, I'm already there.
Body, come!Stupid Body! I gotta do everything myself!Oooh, oooh, and nobody knows...Come with me, Come with me...	Stop hogging the mic!	Oh, honey, if I get restless...	I couldn't if I tried.
Well, trust me, Kim. I've beaten up many nerds in my day. But tonight's about you having the best first date ever.	Well, I'm up for anything. I married my high school boyfriend, so the only first date I ever went on was in tenth grade. I began with me sitting in the backseat of his Miata, because his friend, Benny, called shotgun. And it ends with us going to the arcade, and I quote, to eat pizza and beat up nerds. And I married that guy!	Head loves karaoke.	Body, come!Stupid Body! I gotta do everything myself!Oooh, oooh, and nobody knows...Come with me, Come with me...
Bye!	All right, slugger!	Well, trust me, Kim. I've beaten up many nerds in my day. But tonight's about you having the best first date ever.	Well, I'm up for anything. I married my high school boyfriend, so the only first date I ever went on was in tenth grade. I began with me sitting in the backseat of his Miata, because his friend, Benny, called shotgun. And it ends with us going to the arcade, and I quote, to eat pizza and beat up nerds. And I married that guy!
You had to soil the whole food court thing. It's veal piccata night at Sbarro's!	You don't have anything planned, do you?	Bye!	All right, slugger!
Yeah, yeah, but except this time with two horses.	Ooh, like you and I did for your birthday.	I have to get ready, man. I want my date with Kim to be perfect. What do you think about a romantic horseback ride on the beach?	Uhhhh...AHH! Believe that, missy!
Unfortunately, I can't. My deck has sort of become a cruise-in spot for older, gay gentlemen.Get off my deck, you old queens! Go! HEY! Whose is this?!Whose is this? You find somewhere else to hang out! I know for a fact Les Mis is in town!I tried turning my hose on them, but they liked it.	Why not just take her to your deck? You can just lie out, look at the stars?	Yeah, yeah, but except this time with two horses.	Ooh, like you and I did for your birthday.
I didn't need luck because this was going to be the most romantic date ever.	Well, if anything, good luck, buddy,	Unfortunately, I can't. My deck has sort of become a cruise-in spot for older, gay gentlemen.Get off my deck, you old queens! Go! HEY! Whose is this?!Whose is this? You find somewhere else to hang out! I know for a fact Les Mis is in town!I tried turning my hose on them, but they liked it.	Why not just take her to your deck? You can just lie out, look at the stars?
Upsy-daisy.	J.D.! I've never ridden a horse on the beach before!	Your steed, m'lady.	I didn't need luck because this was going to be the most romantic date ever.
No problemo.	Wow, no saddles. Are you sure you're going to be OK riding bareback?	Upsy-daisy.	J.D.! I've never ridden a horse on the beach before!
Oh, yeah, it was awesome.	Oh, that was amazing! Wasn't that so much fun?	What's so hard about riding bareback?	No problemo.
Looks like my plan is working.	J.D., I'm a urologist and there's a good chance you have testicular torsion. In which case, you could lose a testicle. So, come on. Off with the pants.	Oh, no, no, no. The date continues.	OK, I called an ambulance, but you should really let me examine you.
Actually, that's a preexisting condition.	All right, testicular function is normal. OK, one is significantly larger than the other.	Looks like my plan is working.	J.D., I'm a urologist and there's a good chance you have testicular torsion. In which case, you could lose a testicle. So, come on. Off with the pants.
Yes. Wait, your right or stage right?	So the right one's always been bigger?	Actually, that's a preexisting condition.	All right, testicular function is normal. OK, one is significantly larger than the other.
Retract it.	Ugh, let me test the retraction.	Yes. Wait, your right or stage right?	So the right one's always been bigger?
So, you're from Texas, huh? They say that's the Lone Star State. What exactly does that mean?	OK, the date's not going as planned, but you can still save it with your legendary gift for small talk.	Retract it.	Ugh, let me test the retraction.
And there it was. The moment where pity was turning into genuine affection. Classic Dorian.	No, it was so much more fun than you might think. I mean the first seven or eight minutes rocked! Admittedly, it was a little more like work after that, but at least I got to third base with you.	Oh, Kim, I'm sorry. I wanted to something fun for our first date.	J.D., I hope you're not beating yourself up about this.
Well, maybe we should fix that.	Me too.	I feel like we kinda missed first base.	And there it was. The moment where pity was turning into genuine affection. Classic Dorian.
And then it happened. Elliot Reid: Moment Killer.	We should.	Well, maybe we should fix that.	Me too.
I'm afraid, mocha bear.	All right. There she is. We spent all morning crafting a line so raw with confidence, that if you pull it off you're back in the game.	Sorry.	What are you talking about? I'm selling my old mop. The 2007's are in.
Hey, Kim.	I know. Buck up.	I'm afraid, mocha bear.	All right. There she is. We spent all morning crafting a line so raw with confidence, that if you pull it off you're back in the game.
Well, uh, the swelling's gone down... for now.	Oh, hey, J.D., how are you feeling?	Hey, Kim.	I know. Buck up.
Go out with me again tonight.	You're an idiot! Ha ha ha!	Well, uh, the swelling's gone down... for now.	Oh, hey, J.D., how are you feeling?
With who?	Oh, J.D., I would love to, but I'm going to a Neil Diamond concert.	Go out with me again tonight.	You're an idiot! Ha ha ha!
Hey, Kim. What happened to Neil Diamond?	What's up, chicken butt?	Ugh, I hate cleaning up after those messy, old queens.Ooh, appletini. When did they start drinking straight-guy drinks? Mmm. It's fresh.	Hmm.
Thank you.	I haven't seen Keith in a while, so I'm gonna take him instead. Kim's letting me off the hook.	Hey, Kim. What happened to Neil Diamond?	What's up, chicken butt?
What's up?	You're welcome.	Thank you.	I haven't seen Keith in a while, so I'm gonna take him instead. Kim's letting me off the hook.
It seems like good friends always come through for you.	Nothing.	What's up?	You're welcome.
OK. I'm cool with that.	Why don't we just hang here and look at the stars until we're comfortable to make out a little?	So what do you want to do tonight?	Why does your TV smell like doodoo?
OK, you let me know.	Not yet.	OK. I'm cool with that.	Why don't we just hang here and look at the stars until we're comfortable to make out a little?
And right then, I knew this was the start of something important.	OK, now.	And like that, I felt like all was right with the couples in the world.	OK, you let me know.
Uh, Kim, I'm not really sure how to phrase this, so I'm just gonna dive right in: Have there been other penises?	I'm pretty sure.	You're pregnant? Are you sure?	As for me, I spent my free time getting coworkers I just met pregnant.
Cool.	It's yours, J.D.	Uh, Kim, I'm not really sure how to phrase this, so I'm just gonna dive right in: Have there been other penises?	I'm pretty sure.
Aaaaauuuuugggggghhhhhh!!!!!!	Are you okay?	Cool.	It's yours, J.D.
Well, that's different, Kim, that's hilarious. This is life-changing.	Said the father of my unborn child. Heh!	Yeah. I don't think I've ever seen the inside of your apartment before.	Aaaaauuuuugggggghhhhhh!!!!!!
You know what else is pretty classic when the coffee guy asks for money, you say, "Sorry, my wallet's in my other pair of mocha-chinos." That always gets 'em.	We can get through this.	Well, that's different, Kim, that's hilarious. This is life-changing.	Said the father of my unborn child. Heh!
Scone is also a a funny word; but I don't like them, I prefer croissants.	Ah, dammit. I have to go to the hospital.	You know what else is pretty classic when the coffee guy asks for money, you say, "Sorry, my wallet's in my other pair of mocha-chinos." That always gets 'em.	We can get through this.
Please! I'll be fine. You be careful you're walking for two!Call Turk.	You're clearly freaking out, so, um, you need to promise me that you're gonna find somebody to talk to about this while I'm gone.	Scone is also a a funny word; but I don't like them, I prefer croissants.	Ah, dammit. I have to go to the hospital.
All right! That's enough! I have seen Les Mis over a dozen times, so I have nothing against giant queens per se, all right? In fact, my life would be a whole lot easier if I was married to one of you guys.... Excuse me.	Unfortunately, it was still a hangout spot for gay seniors.	No problem. I'll just go chill at my deck with a little vino.	Awwwwww!
Ohhhh. Wait, let me hear it.	I was dancing.	Why didn't you answer your phone when I called you?	Hold up! Hold up! Hold up! "Las Vegas Police Department." Hello?
Whatever. I'm I I I'm not saluting a pole!	Nah. I'm a pirate.	Are you insane?	We're at war, my friend. All American flags are on backorder. What do you want me to do in the meantime, run a pirate flag up there? Maybe turn the whole building into a pirate ship? I could put a captain's wheel up on the roof...catch a parrot somehow...slap on an eyepatch...go to work with a caulk-gun, seal her up, make her watertight I can take her out to sea.
I was trying to!	'Scuse us!Dude, please tell me you're not comparing getting cancer to knocking up your girlfriend.	Trust me, I know what you're going through. Just yesterday, I found out that my girlfriend	I can't believe this is happening to me.
What about you and the motorcycle accident guy!?	You can't pawn your personal stuff off on your patients!	I was trying to!	'Scuse us!Dude, please tell me you're not comparing getting cancer to knocking up your girlfriend.
No, I do. I find it gets the ladies going, but I occasionally get wrapped up in it myself, especially when I use some of my different voices....	Ooooh! She like-a the dirty talk!	Okay, on the night of said conception, uh, Kim and I nuded up, and um...the dirty talk began, and I got a little over-excited.	Right. Sure.
Anyhoo, there was some unexpected friendly fire. And, uh, even though I never got a chance to enter..."the village"...uh, there was a..."airstrike" on one of the outlying regions	He does.	No, I do. I find it gets the ladies going, but I occasionally get wrapped up in it myself, especially when I use some of my different voices....	Ooooh! She like-a the dirty talk!
Anyway, I spoke to the gals up in OB-G, and they said it's not uncommon for a woman to get pregnant even if there was no actual penetration.	Thank you.	Anyhoo, there was some unexpected friendly fire. And, uh, even though I never got a chance to enter..."the village"...uh, there was a..."airstrike" on one of the outlying regions	He does.
No, I didn't have a condom.And, uh, we decided not to have sex because here's the kicker I didn't want to get her pregnant.	What you trying to tell us is that you...never actually had sex with her?	Anyway, I spoke to the gals up in OB-G, and they said it's not uncommon for a woman to get pregnant even if there was no actual penetration.	Thank you.
As I thought about how Mrs. Zeebee and I had gotten such a raw deal, I realized how easy it was for doctors to see themselves in their patients.Whether it's in the choices they made in their life...	Oh, no you didn't!	No, I didn't have a condom.And, uh, we decided not to have sex because here's the kicker I didn't want to get her pregnant.	What you trying to tell us is that you...never actually had sex with her?
Or not.	There you are. You ready to grab some lunch so that we can talk?	Either way, it forces you to face your problems head-on.	No, I punched a whale, right in the face. Down he went, like Liston.
What if Kim and I don't end up together? Okay? I already have enough trouble meeting girls. Can you imagine it now? "Hey, how you doin'? I'm J.D., and this little bugger right here already hates ya for not being his real mommy! Wanna get freaky? I'm apparently very fertile!"	I knew it was something Puerto Rican.	Yeah, that you planned with your wife, whose middle name you know.	Really? 'Cause the last time I checked, I was having a kid, too.
The most important thing to remember when you see yourself in a patient is that they're not actually you.In fact, sometimes, they're actually who we wish we had the courage to be.	Mrs. Zeebee, unfortunately the cancer isn't localized just to your breast. We're gonna have to start chemo right away.	Oh, man. This just sucks.	Mrs. Zeebee's CAT-scan came back.
Yeah.	You know what? I'm gonna get through this. Just you watch.

Mrs. Zeebee, unfortunately the cancer isn't localized just to your breast. We're gonna have to start chemo right away.
Whoa! Oof!	Right then, I knew exactly what I had to do, come hell or high water.	Yeah.	You know what? I'm gonna get through this. Just you watch.
What the hell?	Uh-huh! I got your Juanita. Juanita, huh? Well you can Jua-nita this right there.	Whoa! Oof!	Right then, I knew exactly what I had to do, come hell or high water.
Are you gonna let me down anytime soon?	It's now or never.	What the hell?	Uh-huh! I got your Juanita. Juanita, huh? Well you can Jua-nita this right there.
As I acted like a flag, I sensed that the Janitor learned nothing from this experience.Dr. Cox, on the other hand, got halfway there. He may always be angry at work, but he had learned to control himself when it counts.	Not until you spend a little time acting like a flag.	Are you gonna let me down anytime soon?	It's now or never.
You're right.	I dunno. If we keep it, it'll just end up in the dumpster.	Should we keep it or get rid of it?	Dr. Cox and Jordan weren't the only ones with kid troubles. My brand new girlfriend was pregnant, and we were trying to decide what to do.
Of course I do! What about you? Any nieces or nephews?	So, uh, let's go.... Um.... Do you like kids?	You're right.	I dunno. If we keep it, it'll just end up in the dumpster.
Oh, no!	Yeah, I have a nephew. Although he's forty-five. But occasionally I do have to change his diaper he was kicked by a horse.	Of course I do! What about you? Any nieces or nephews?	So, uh, let's go.... Um.... Do you like kids?
So beautiful! I hope you keep some ice in this locket, 'cause you're making me hot all over!	Yeah.	Oh, no!	Yeah, I have a nephew. Although he's forty-five. But occasionally I do have to change his diaper he was kicked by a horse.
What? Oh! Sure! Uh, I'll take a look at it first thing tomorrow morning, huh?	Actually, it's the only picture I have of my biological father. D'you wanna see it?	So beautiful! I hope you keep some ice in this locket, 'cause you're making me hot all over!	Yeah.
I know I will.	You think if it's a girl, you'd doink her?	Yeah, I'm not a big fan of adoption.	What? Oh! Sure! Uh, I'll take a look at it first thing tomorrow morning, huh?
I'm totally fine with stalling.	Yep. All right, well, look, we don't need to make this decision tonight, right? I mean, plenty of time.	I know I will.	You think if it's a girl, you'd doink her?
Stylish big daddy hat!	Check.	Okay, Brown Bear, commence Operation Brown Cub! Suitcase!	He's here! And now we can have our baby!
Big-time collegiate drum-line!	Check.	Stylish big daddy hat!	Check.
Fo' shizzle.	Sometimes when you need a miracle, you have to pray extra-extra hard. You wanna help me out?	What are you doing?	Of course I have your suitcase, honey.
But what if	Okay, I'm gonna make this real simple: No abortions, okay?	But what if having this baby is a huge mistake for us?	She's right, J.D. Every life is precious.
Lemme finish! What if the parents were like abusive drug addicts who would neglect their kids?	No abortions!	But what if	Okay, I'm gonna make this real simple: No abortions, okay?
Really?	Oh, well, in that case it'd be okay.	Lemme finish! What if the parents were like abusive drug addicts who would neglect their kids?	No abortions!
Ohhh!	Owen Wilson.	Kirsten Dunst?	This sucks. I mean, the hardest decision I've had to make in the last year was what hairstyle to get. And even then, all I did was open up an US Magazine, close my eyes and pick a random celebrity.
You know what might give us an inkling? We haven't technically had sex yet. That might help us find out if we're on the same page...you know...in the boudoir.	Yeah.You know what's making this so hard? This relationship is so new, we can't tell if we have a chance of making this work long-term.	Ohhh!	Owen Wilson.
I'm sorry, I'm being an idiot, aren't I.	Are you hitting on me?	You know what might give us an inkling? We haven't technically had sex yet. That might help us find out if we're on the same page...you know...in the boudoir.	Yeah.You know what's making this so hard? This relationship is so new, we can't tell if we have a chance of making this work long-term.
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...!...Yeah!	Nope. Clothes off. We're doing it.	I'm sorry, I'm being an idiot, aren't I.	Are you hitting on me?
I can finally buy Beanie Babies without feeling weird, and kids are great!	True.	your boobs'll get huge	Yes.
Tax deductions!	Which we already said.	I can finally buy Beanie Babies without feeling weird, and kids are great!	True.
Ohhh! Yeah! That's some	Ohhh! Nice one!	Tax deductions!	Which we already said.
Nice. Let's see, that's twenty cons and nineteen pros. I guess we gotta abort.	All right, so then what's the final tally?	Ohhh! Yeah! That's some	Ohhh! Nice one!
Wait, I'm sorry. That's an eyelash, I made a wish. It's a tie abortion's off.	Yep.	Nice. Let's see, that's twenty cons and nineteen pros. I guess we gotta abort.	All right, so then what's the final tally?
Every couple has its share of problems.	Okay, so now what?	Wait, I'm sorry. That's an eyelash, I made a wish. It's a tie abortion's off.	Yep.
You don't see that every day.	Don't you wish it was this easy head's yes, tail's no.	Still, nothing's worse than facing the biggest decision of your life and not getting anywhere.	Elliot's got everything covered.
Ahh! Should I have a baby, too?	Ah, it's really simple: See, when Carla says "I'm thirsty," Elliot'll say, "Oh no, I forgot the ice chips." That's when I walk in, ice in hand, and I say, "Christopher Turk, at your cervix!"	So what is Elliot's plan?	Keith! Private!
Ah, this is way over Justin's head. He's never been in love. Not real love, anyway.	You know, I'm a little preoccupied right now. Why don't you ask your unicorn?	Ahh! Should I have a baby, too?	Ah, it's really simple: See, when Carla says "I'm thirsty," Elliot'll say, "Oh no, I forgot the ice chips." That's when I walk in, ice in hand, and I say, "Christopher Turk, at your cervix!"
Appletinis.	I got nothing.	One, two, three.	Okay.
Carla's having a C-section.	Maybe that's your answer.	Yeah, but what if we don't feel anything?	It's not a logical decision. If it's right, you'll feel it in your heart.
They say you never realize your capacity to love until you have a child. It can change who you are...	The baby's out, but the cord was wrapped around its neck, so...we had to take it to the NICU.	Miguel, please!	Guys. I have an announcement.
...it can even give your heart the answer you thought you'd never find.	Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce you to Isabella Turk.	...they can fill you with joy...	"Where do babies come from?" Well.... When a mommy and a daddy love each other very, very much, sometimes they close their eyes...and they make a wish.
Mmm. That's what we call "Cabbage-tastic."	Hey, Dr. D.	Frontsies!	Still, the best discovery was learning that someone I drummed out of medicine had landed on his feet.
Eww. How about a second of that dynamite ape impression.I'm sorry, Cindy, once he's in monkey mode, you can't stop him. But who would want to, right? Cheers.Hey, Kim! Just checkin' to see if your socks are back on, since I knocked 'em off last night! Helloooooo!	Oh, I love this job I screw up, nobody gets hurt. Except Cindy.	Mmm.

On the bright side, you have beautiful nubs.	This is my wife, Sally. She lost her thumbs last month when our pet Komodo dragon, Morty, got out of his cage.	How great is that!	Dr. Lemke! You're gonna love this. We're a husband and wife piano playing team, only I have no hands!With my head!
You always buy me a cotton candy after the game to celebrate my good sportsmanship.	Yeah.	Ohh!	No, "Rajesh" is like "Steve" in India.
Yeah, well, I'm very close to a tantrum.	Yeah, well, you know what? I can't be buying you stuff all the time!	You always buy me a cotton candy after the game to celebrate my good sportsmanship.	Yeah.
Come on, Vijay, first you dunk on me and yell, "Who's your bitch!" now you want free medical advice?	Could you guys look at my shoulder? I tweaked it pretty good.	Yeah, well, I'm very close to a tantrum.	Yeah, well, you know what? I can't be buying you stuff all the time!
I'm sorry, my friend, but that's just not ethical.	I'll give you twenty bucks.	Come on, Vijay, first you dunk on me and yell, "Who's your bitch!" now you want free medical advice?	Could you guys look at my shoulder? I tweaked it pretty good.
Ohhhhh! You crafty, crafty man that is fluffing up nicely. Hey, give me some money, I'm jonesing for some c-squared.	Just added the dye.	I'm sorry, cotton candy man, but unlike my friend, here, I have no interest in being sued for Do I smell blue?	Hey. I'll give you twenty bucks if you check out my rash.
You heartless bastard. All right, let's see your disgusting rash.	Oh, you don't want my back-alley money, do you?	Ohhhhh! You crafty, crafty man that is fluffing up nicely. Hey, give me some money, I'm jonesing for some c-squared.	Just added the dye.
"...they may deceive you..."	Greetings, customer! What can I get you?	Sometimes everything you need to know is on the side of a coffee cup.	Is anybody planning on emptying that?
Please, this isn't about that. It's just that I looked all over, I never found any balloons. You'd think there'd be some balloons.	J.D., for the last time, nothing happened.	I know. In seven months, I'm gonna have a family, too.	Wow, I got a family.
Well that sucks, 'cause I was counting on you to make it look easy so I know I can handle it when my turn comes.	I look at Isabella, and I get really scared. And I'm gonna need you to be there to help me through this.	Please, this isn't about that. It's just that I looked all over, I never found any balloons. You'd think there'd be some balloons.

And I'm gonna need you to be there to help me through this.
You're gonna be just fine.	It's good to hear that from you, thank you.	Turk, you're at the beginning of your career. You know you're gonna make plenty of money.	Awesome.
...Totally fine.	I suppose so.	You're gonna be just fine.	It's good to hear that from you, thank you.
Would you mind telling me that I'm gonna be fine, Turk? Am I gonna be fine? I think I'm gonna be fine!	Yeah.	...Totally fine.	I suppose so.
I really like her.	Well, I would, but I don't know how much you like Kim.	Would you mind telling me that I'm gonna be fine, Turk? Am I gonna be fine? I think I'm gonna be fine!	Yeah.
Thanks.	Then you're gonna be fine.	I really like her.	Well, I would, but I don't know how much you like Kim.
...or taking a new job.	Hey.Now clean up this mess.	Opportunities are everywhere......Whether it's accepting an old job...	Thanks.
As for me, I was just excited to have the opportunity to get to know the mother of my child better.	I'd...like to join your practice.	...or taking a new job.	Hey.Now clean up this mess.
Cool! Is it over at County? 'Cause that way I can drop you off every morning.	I got offered a new job.	As for me, I was just excited to have the opportunity to get to know the mother of my child better.	I'd...like to join your practice.
Oh. That's gonna be a little rough on my scooter.	It's in Tacoma, Washington.	Cool! Is it over at County? 'Cause that way I can drop you off every morning.	I got offered a new job.
I am your superior! what the ?Oh, hey, Elliot, I'll have him back to you in one second.	Oh, J.D., I don't want -	Oh, of course I miss you, baby! Want to see a picture of me missing you? Hold on. Oh, thanks. Do you want to see a picture of my rock-hard abs? Ok, hold on. No, no, I've always had an innie. She wants to see a picture of my ass.	As for me, my pregnant girlfriend just moved away, but I was still keeping things spicy.
Still, the biggest perk is that at 5:00, she gets to dump her patients on someone else and go home.	Hey, Dr. Kelso. Oh, if you're a doody face, don't say anything.	Now that Elliot was private practice, there were tons of perks. For one, Dr. Kelso still refused to speak to her.	One areola shot, real quick.
"7- car pile-up" would be a good name for a rock band.	Hey, roomie! I went shopping. Oh, this couch reminded me of my grandpa. He used to drive around in a car just like it. You know, until he was killed in that 7-car pile-up.	To me, the best thing about Elliot is all her extra cash.	Woman, the turks can handle anything.
Why stop at hardwood?	Yeah, you actually told me that on the day that he died. Anywho, I was thinking maybe we should put in some new hardwood floors.

Careful. Trampoline floors take some gettin' used to. But I love 'em.I like bouncing, but it is dangerous.	Yay, the new floors are in!	Why stop at hardwood?	Yeah, you actually told me that on the day that he died. Anywho, I was thinking maybe we should put in some new hardwood floors.
I guess I do.or even just a little surprise waiting at home.	Wait, do you actually agree with dr.	I just thought, you know, money, like a sell-out, so	I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
I do not! OK, resist smelling that coconut goodness that caresses your tresses! Don't do it! Whatever.	Oh, please, J.	I am not jealous.	ooh, hey, chuckles! If you're a doody face, just keep walking.I'm not mad.
No, not particularly.	Oh, don't you just love the way his thighs feel against your ears?	No, never, ok? And thanks a lot, because the one hour that Kim and I had to actually talk, I was stuckin your stupid boyfriend's scissor-hold.	He wrestled you, didn't he? See, Keith got his old high school uniform so that he actually incorporated it into our love play. I'm the lesbian coach and he's the captain of the wrestling team, and he turns me. So, have you decided to admit that you're jealous?
Or how he found a way to eliminate any facetime with the patients.	Thanks.	Dr.	And back to insulting you, she's been gone 6 weeks, Bobo, the 6 days that you're referring to are the 6 days you actually worked this month.
Since Elliot bought a house, I had to look for a place to live. Time to get out of my head and into an apartment.	Ooohdizzy.	My daydreams are crazy.	Ask again later. Why would I say that?
You've that globe nearby?	Ok, in my opinion we should be looking for Bin Laden in Pakistan.	Prepare to be dazzled.	I'll debate Iraq with you.
For Dr. Kelso, he wouldn't have it any other way.	Good night minions, Slugathor.	In life it seems we all have a role to play. Some of us are meant to be loved, and some of us, unfortunately, are meant to be hated.	You've that globe nearby?
Donna! Ahhh!!!	I'm gonna beat your ass!	My bad...	I wasn't home last night.
Oh man, Kim is having her first ultrasound tommorow.	I'm trying, Doc, but it's hard.	Alright, Mr. Mariani, mazel tov; you are the proud owner of yet another kidney stone! Did you try laying off the red meat, buddy?	You smell like my mom...
Are you kidding me? I can't just up and leave, I got to find an apartment I live in a T.P.	Oh, there's nothing like that first ultrasound. Bring tissue.	Oh man, Kim is having her first ultrasound tommorow.	I'm trying, Doc, but it's hard.
So you guys in?	The secret to a great road trip is to get as many people as possible to come along.	'Dorian'. Oh, damn it now I'm doing it. Careful, he's going fetus.	He can't possibly make it my fault, right?
Ye...	Ye?	You know, Keith, if the buyer hadn't been an undercover federal, Elliot would be a slave somewhere. There wouldn't be any uncomftorable sexual tension between us, and you and I would probably be best friends.	Keith, they tried to sell me.
I knew that little tant baby will eventually ruin everything.	Getting to know his daughter.	Road trip! Where's chocolate bear?	Ghandi, I'm great at this stuff. Don't ever talk to Jordan again.
Ted, who's driving?	Don't touch the kimonos, those are for Dr Kelso's various masseuses.	Nice cover.	Carla got some serious moves! She can even do an inverted spread - legs pole spin. You know if thats how they called, It's not like I've take a pole dancing class or anything.
You got it, pal.	Could you rub that spot off my dashboard?	Of course, Jonathan 3000.	We are cruising at a comfortable speed, Dr. Dorian. We should arrive on schedule. Could you possible do me a small favor?
Alright.	Oh yeah, just like that.	You got it, pal.	Could you rub that spot off my dashboard?
It can get lonely on the road, even for computers. But this is gonna be great, right?	That's the stuff, you bitch!	Alright.	Oh yeah, just like that.
Whar are you doing here?	Amen to that.	That's enough! If you guys can't get along just sit down and don't talk.	Kick his ass, Ted!
You guys, Turk told me how amazing it was when he say Izzy's ultrasound, I can't miss this, I just, I won't.	Ahhh! Oh... I think you popped it back in the joint.	See? He's great. And so is Ted.	Hi, wait, no. coming back. Hello. Who is making pancakes?
There are a lot of times in life when you just got to take control.	Can I say something? I don't know this young man, I wish I did. I admire his spirit! And if he says we must continue on then I say I am in!	You guys, Turk told me how amazing it was when he say Izzy's ultrasound, I can't miss this, I just, I won't.	Ahhh! Oh... I think you popped it back in the joint.
Come here for a second, come here. Is this your office?	Oh my God... J.D.!	Surprise.	In life, it's never easy to know what's waiting for you on the other side of the door.
Other times, it just takes your breath away.	J.D., I had a miscarrige.	How's our baby doing, huh?	Sometimes you find a moment that knocks you on your ass.
I was alredy kinda looking for doing all those parents things you hear about, you know like - change diapers, first steps, playing catch. Turk was gonna even teach me how to throw like a guy, so...	I know...	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I just... it's kinda weird, there was this thing that I never met and now it's gone and I kinda miss it.	I should have told you earlier, I just didn't want to do it on the phone and... are you O.K.?
No... no, c'mon. Come back from this in a couple of months and we'll pick up whereever we left off. I mean, I guess it will be a little more casual, we should probably won't talk without either one of us wearing full body condoms.	Unless it was a girl, then you could just throw like yourself. Can I ask you something? Were we just staying together cuz' we were having a kid?	I was alredy kinda looking for doing all those parents things you hear about, you know like - change diapers, first steps, playing catch. Turk was gonna even teach me how to throw like a guy, so...	I know...
Did they?	What if I... wasn't coming back because they offered me a permanent position here?	No... no, c'mon. Come back from this in a couple of months and we'll pick up whereever we left off. I mean, I guess it will be a little more casual, we should probably won't talk without either one of us wearing full body condoms.	Unless it was a girl, then you could just throw like yourself. Can I ask you something? Were we just staying together cuz' we were having a kid?
We sat there all night and talked about everything. How we felt about each other, whether we can handle a long distance relationship, did she ever see herself come back to 'The Sacred Heart', will a pizza place deliver to a bench at three in the morning... they would... And on the end of it all, we realized that without a baby in the picture, the best thing to do is to say goodbye, stay friends and just hope that our paths cross again. Someday.	Yeah...	Did they?	What if I... wasn't coming back because they offered me a permanent position here?
Then you have to convince the morgue guy to sit on the paperwork so the deceased's bed stays open.	Cool, Mr. Rabinowitz just kicked it! Oh, don't worry, he put his peep in an electrical socket. You can't do that.	When a patient doesn't have insurance, you have to work around the system. First, you have to find someone who's recently died.	All right, let's find her a room.
Then you have to get the floor nurses to play along.	Deal.	Then you have to convince the morgue guy to sit on the paperwork so the deceased's bed stays open.	Cool, Mr. Rabinowitz just kicked it! Oh, don't worry, he put his peep in an electrical socket. You can't do that.
Then you have to find a surgeon to do the work pro bono.	Enjoy your kosher meal, Mr. Rabinowitz.	Then you have to get the floor nurses to play along.	Deal.
Dr. Kelso, we need to talk to you.	Bob, I want to thank you for doing all this, even though I don't have any...	But, most importantly, you can't let any higher-ups find out that a patient is uninsured, even if they're the ones who brought her here in the first place.	I got this one.
Uh, we want to go somewhere with you.	What is it?	Dr. Kelso, we need to talk to you.	Bob, I want to thank you for doing all this, even though I don't have any...
A spa. We'd like to get some massages.	Okay. Where?	Uh, we want to go somewhere with you.	What is it?
Others are admittedly a tad more dramatic.	Save my seat.	Everyone reacts differently to unpleasant discoveries. Some people get angry.	I don't have insurance. It's okay, I can get by.
Please, God!	Lord!	God, please!	I mean, guys, I know all about bottoming out. All right? It wasn't long ago that I was out there , on my knees, praying to the gods for help.
Why?	Bring him back!	Please, God!	Lord!
And just like that, we got our old scrubs back.	Yeah, when you took away the scrubs, you took away the trust, and without trust, everything falls apart.	We used to, but if you're gonna threaten to fire us over taking a pair of scrubs, why wouldn't we think you'd fire us for treating an uninsured patient?	Well, why didn't we do what we always do? Why didn't you fix it while I turned my back and pretend not to notice? You know the dance.
Even though I was the only one who knew how to embrace life, we all left thinking about how important trust is.Dr. Cox let Elliot keep her trust in humankind a while longer.	I'm telling you guys, this could have been a much bigger moment.	And just like that, we got our old scrubs back.	Yeah, when you took away the scrubs, you took away the trust, and without trust, everything falls apart.
That's Stephen. Don't ask me how I know that.	Well, how are we supposed to know who's who?	I'm cool with keeping Stephen. We've gotten to know each other quite well.	Now, at least, you can both have one.
Still, it was worth it.	Good night, sir.	As for Dr. Kelso, he knew that trusting us again was probably foolish.	That's Stephen. Don't ask me how I know that.
