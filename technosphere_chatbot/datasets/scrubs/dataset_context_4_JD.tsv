Chris Turk's my best friend. We roomed together in college...We roomed together in med school...Hell, we even got accepted by the same hospital.	Dude, be whiter.	You know how I'm totally down with the rap music?	'Sup.	Hey, Turk.
See, that's good for me to know. I didn't-I didn't know that.	No.	Right. My question is this: if we're both singing along, and knowing that otherwise I would never use the word, am I allowed to say-	I got it.	Here's the thing: TuPac, DMX, Dr. Dre, in most of their songs, these artists use an extremely volatile racial slur... the "N" word.
Hey, listen, I found us an apartment....	Finally, doctors, if there is a mistake, don't admit it to the patient. Of course, if the patient is deceased, and you're sure, you can feel free to tell him or her... anything.	See, that's good for me to know. I didn't-I didn't know that.	No.	Right. My question is this: if we're both singing along, and knowing that otherwise I would never use the word, am I allowed to say-
Your butt looks like two Pringles hugging.	Anyway, I know what you're thinking.	I know. I would have laughed if you'd paused.	So, every male in my family is a doctor: my dad, my grand-dad, and my brother. I guess that's why dad gave me a guy's name, made me play sports, date girls. I'm joking.	Heh-heh. Hello.
Please. I'm not that desperate.	Yes!	Hey, are we, like, racing?	I'm probably "Miss Hyper Competitive". I mean, it used to be a big problem for me. "Used to" - past tense.	No you don't.
Oh, yeah.	So, you do a lot of cardio, or...?	Please. I'm not that desperate.	Yes!	Hey, are we, like, racing?
You ever notice how quickly some people make an impression?	Elliot Reid? John Dorian? Great. One: I am your resident, Dr. Jeffrey Steadman - not "Jeff". Two: Here are your manuals. This -	Oh, yeah.	So, you do a lot of cardio, or...?	Please. I'm not that desperate.
Yeah.	I'm a tool. I'm a tool. I'm a tool, tool, tool, an unbelievably annoying tool.	You ever notice how quickly some people make an impression?	Elliot Reid? John Dorian? Great. One: I am your resident, Dr. Jeffrey Steadman - not "Jeff". Two: Here are your manuals. This -	Oh, yeah.
Back to today.	Yeah. Finally, these are your beepers . From now on, they control your entire life. 'Kay? Thanks. Move it.	Yeah.	I'm a tool. I'm a tool. I'm a tool, tool, tool, an unbelievably annoying tool.	You ever notice how quickly some people make an impression?
Oh, I know. Yeah.	You know with the...	Well, how could you not be....	I was just frazzled.	I'm sure you did.
You could let me take you to dinner tomorrow night.Around seven.... Or eight.	Good. But thanks. If there's anything I can ever do for you, just	Oh, I know. Yeah.	You know with the...	Well, how could you not be....
Dr. Kelso, he's always telling me, you know, "You've gotta stay positive!"	And under no circumstances are you to compromise our "no talking" agreement.	But I	It's regular-strength Tylenol! Here's what'cha do: Get her to open her mouth, take a handful, and throw it at her. Whatever sticks, that's the correct dosage.	I was worried that it could exacerbate the patient's
It's just that, this isn't really what I expected... You know...Most of my patients are, uh...older and sorta checked-out, mentally.	I'm gonna go ahead and say this just as carefully as possible so I don't overstate it: Dr. Kelso is the most evil human being on the planet. And may, in fact, be Satan, himself.	Dr. Kelso, he's always telling me, you know, "You've gotta stay positive!"	And under no circumstances are you to compromise our "no talking" agreement.	But I
It's just that, do you really think we should be talking about this in front of....	Pumpkin, that's modern medicine. Advances that keep people alive who should have died a long time ago, back when they lost what made them people.Now, your job is to stay sane enough so that when someone does come in that you actually can help, you're not so brain-dead that you can't function. For the love of God, what!?	It's just that, this isn't really what I expected... You know...Most of my patients are, uh...older and sorta checked-out, mentally.

You've been like a father to me.	Her? She's dead.Write this down, newbie: If you push around a stiff, nobody'll ask you to do anything.

And there it is.	Fair enough, you want some real advice? If they find out the nurses are doing your procedures for you, your ass'll be kicked outta here so quick, it'll make your head spin.	You've been like a father to me.	Her? She's dead.Write this down, newbie: If you push around a stiff, nobody'll ask you to do anything.	It's just that, do you really think we should be talking about this in front of....
Oh, you think?	Okay, uh, maybe the needle was just a little too big.	Why couldn't I do that? I hated him at that moment.	Come on, man, learn by doing! Learn by doing.	I think this needle's too big. I'm gonna get a nurse.
Okay.	Do me right here.	Well, I'll tell you one thing, the last thing in the world I wanna do is sleep wit'cha now!	Oh please, if you didn't want to sleep with me, you'd have done the same thing.	I thought we cared about each other....
ARGH!	See!	Okay.	Do me right here.	Well, I'll tell you one thing, the last thing in the world I wanna do is sleep wit'cha now!
Our date is is totally canceled!	Right. Pass me a trach. kit.Thanks.	ARGH!	See!	Okay.
Call you?	Look, worst case scenario, you kill somebody, and that hangs over your head the rest of your life....But that is the absolute worst case scenario. Come on, newbie, look: Just have the nurses do all the stuff you're still too chicken to do, which I assume covers just about everything, and if you have a really rough admission	Yeah.	You're worried about being on-call tonight, aren't you.	Seems like a good kid.
Why didn't anybody page me?	He crashed. The attending thinks it was a pulmonary embolism.No way anyone could have caught it. Anyhow, you have to pronounce him.	Are you flirting with me?You are, aren't you!	I need to see you in Mr. Bursky's room.	I'll check on you every ten minutes, Mrs. Moreno, okay?
I'll never forget that moment, the way he looked exactly the same...only completely different. The shame that all I could think about was how hard this was for me.	Could you just pronounce him so I can go home?	Why didn't anybody page me?	He crashed. The attending thinks it was a pulmonary embolism.No way anyone could have caught it. Anyhow, you have to pronounce him.	Are you flirting with me?You are, aren't you!
I just wanted to help people.	Time of death 0200.	I'll never forget that moment, the way he looked exactly the same...only completely different. The shame that all I could think about was how hard this was for me.	Could you just pronounce him so I can go home?	Why didn't anybody page me?
Ask him to move in again.	Anyway, I just came to check up on you; see how you're doing.	He needs me?	Well, I need you to tell me that every once in a while, man.	Well, I think it's okay to be scared.
They're still in there with him, sir.	Okay..... Uh, did you ask the Bursky family for permission to do an autopsy?	Yeah, but she's, like, a second away from total renal failure.	I saw that you're still pushing to put Mrs. Pratt on the transplant list. Bad news, though, sport: she doesn't have the insurance to cover it.	Ah, there he is, my safety net.
Just tell him you can't see Mr. Bursky again. He'll understand.	It's a teaching hospital, son, you gotta ask.	They're still in there with him, sir.	Okay..... Uh, did you ask the Bursky family for permission to do an autopsy?	Yeah, but she's, like, a second away from total renal failure.
I am pretty tired!	In fact, why don't you just head on home. You look kinda tired.	See? Every story needs a good guy.	Why, sure, sport.	Sir, do you do you think I could skip just this one?
Crystal clear.	Dr. Dorian, do you not realize that you're nothing but a large pair of scrubs to me? For God's sake, the only reason I carry this chart around is so I can pretend to remember your damn names! Now look, if the patient has insurance, you treat them; if they don't, you show them the door.And if somebody dies, you get the autopsy. You get it by rounds tomorrow morning, or I'll be scratching your name off my chart! Are we clear!?Answer me!!!	I am pretty tired!	In fact, why don't you just head on home. You look kinda tired.	See? Every story needs a good guy.
I don't get it, if he's the jerk, then who's the good guy?	Great, sport.	Crystal clear.	Dr. Dorian, do you not realize that you're nothing but a large pair of scrubs to me?

...You know, kinda.	Chest-tube tray.	And I believed him...	Look at me. You can do this.	Oh God, no.
You can do this. You have to do this.	Come on, baby, let's go; chop-chop.	...You know, kinda.	Chest-tube tray.	And I believed him...
Okay, gimme the tube.I can't get it through the pleura.	J.D., cut him or lose him.	You can do this. You have to do this.	Come on, baby, let's go; chop-chop.	...You know, kinda.
Okay, connect it, please, Carla.	Well, don't be gentle, get it in there.	Okay, gimme the tube.I can't get it through the pleura.	J.D., cut him or lose him.	You can do this. You have to do this.
No way!	Normal rhythm.	Okay, connect it, please, Carla.	Well, don't be gentle, get it in there.	Okay, gimme the tube.I can't get it through the pleura.
You're leaving?	Eh? It's a piece of cake.That's your patient.	No way!	Normal rhythm.	Okay, connect it, please, Carla.
Even now, when I finally get to go home, in the back of my head, I'll know the hospital's still here, wide awake.	I'm a dork. I'm a dork! I'm a dork. ...I'm a dork.	You see, I can't survive on my own.	I forgive her.	The worst part was knowing, right then, that I could never forgive her.
But what the hell. The most important thing is that I got through my first three days without looking like a complete idiot.	Bambi! Get out while you still can.	Even now, when I finally get to go home, in the back of my head, I'll know the hospital's still here, wide awake.	I'm a dork. I'm a dork! I'm a dork. ...I'm a dork.	You see, I can't survive on my own.
No. She's just a friend, man.	Yeah!	Nooo....	Ohh... you want to hit that!	Just give her a chance, man.
I think it's healthy hanging out with a girl without the ultimate goal being sex. You know?	Yeah.	No. She's just a friend, man.	Yeah!	Nooo....
I like Will. That actually makes this harder.	He was... We're all in on it.	Oh. I know, I was just totally kidding with you.	What tests have you ordered?	Oh, I don't smoke, so... zero packs.
Means, Don't ever touch him.	Don't. Ever. Touch me.	Means, "You're really coming along as a doctor."	I'm, um, I'm just happy you haven't messed up yet today.	Means, "Great idea!"
No, see, nothing needs to be clear.	I I just want to make one thing clear.	Okay, good!	But thank you for apologizing.	Ahhh, the comfortable silences.
No, it's not.	Let me see.This is so cool!	So, right now, the one thing that I want you to think about......How would you like to sound like this?	I had to scare him, but I had the sense he'd heard it all before. Luckily, part of being a doctor is your ability to improvise.	Yeah, well, Will, you're on a slippery slope, man.
It's not a toy.Would you like to play a game?	Bwiddy-bwiddy-bwiddy. Okay, doc.	No, it's not.	Let me see.This is so cool!	So, right now, the one thing that I want you to think about......How would you like to sound like this?
Look, man, you're a great patient. I like you enough to hope I never see you again. But, I promise you, if you keep smoking, you'll be back here. I bet my own life on that.	Sometimes, if all you have is old words, all you can do is put them together and hope they say something new.	It's not a toy.Would you like to play a game?	Bwiddy-bwiddy-bwiddy. Okay, doc.	No, it's not.
I'm not your lap-dog.	No more walkies, no more treats, no more following me around the hospital.	Excuse me?	Do you know what you've just done? You just lost all lap-dog privileges.	I need to know how we're going to fix this thing with Will.
Of course I will.	Then, would you stay... and watch the game with me? Maybe have a slice of pizza?	It's not.	Well, actually, you have a point. I guess watching the game by yourself with a scotch isn't, really, the only way to watch a game, huh. I don't know. I just, I've always thought of needing people as a sign of weakness.	Okay, if he comes at you, just try and roll out the door.
You know it all, man.	So... anything you wanna say?	Yeah... he's new here.	This is a strange resort, man. I mean, this wheelchair service is great, but that suite I rented... there's another person in it. And for some reason, the bellhop gave me an enema.	...Acceptance that some things are gonna be what they're gonna be.
Yeah, but you told me not	But you wanted to.	Nope.	Say anything else to him?	Still, I hated Will a little.......'Cause, thanks to him, I started to look at all the people who were important to me in terms of what will probably kill them.Heart Disease...Liver disease...Somebody choking her...I dunno... Probably stress.
Wait a second, is she joking? 'Cause if she's joking and I kiss her...Of course, if she's not joking...	Well, uh, goodnight....	Oh, baby, I don't play by the rules.	You better. And don't do the whole two-day waiting thing.	Oh, yeah, me too. So... can I page you?
Yes!	Come on, I don't do this for all the doctors.	Wait a second, is she joking? 'Cause if she's joking and I kiss her...Of course, if she's not joking...	Well, uh, goodnight....	Oh, baby, I don't play by the rules.
Okay, I was looking at Bidwell...	J.D., I'ma show you what the deal's oh, oh, oh, ohh...All right, that's game. What's so important?	Suddenly, I was so fed up, I decided to teach Turk and Todd a lesson right there on the court.......You know, once I warmed up a little.	Don't bring in the same weak-ass crap the last kid did!	And there it was, everything was more important than me now.
Well, I'm sure you'll end up seeing him before I do, so....	Not since this morning.	Okay.... Have you seen Turk?	Um... no, it hasn't come back yet.	Have you seen Mr. Bidwell's blood work?
What if I am?	Bambi? Are you giving me attitude?	Well, I'm sure you'll end up seeing him before I do, so....	Not since this morning.	Okay.... Have you seen Turk?
Okay, I'm gonna leave now.	Sweetie, you have to be a minority sidekick in a bad movie to pull that off. You know what I'm talking about, right?Explain it to this man, please.First, you do the head, then you do the finger, then you talk through the nose......And then you give a lot of attitude. That's how it works. But if you're not from there, you don't understand, so I'm not gonna even 'axe' you	What if I am?	Bambi? Are you giving me attitude?	Well, I'm sure you'll end up seeing him before I do, so....
Why am I protecting Turk when he can't even give me five seconds of his time?	Look, if you know about something, by not reporting it you're every bit as culpable. Now, is there anything that you'd like to tell me?	No, no, I'm not even sure there is a problem. I'm running tests, I'm doing everything that I should be doing.	...Maimed, mutilated, disfigured.... Let's not split hairs.	No, no; no one killed anyone.
Tell him.	Anything at all?	Why am I protecting Turk when he can't even give me five seconds of his time?	Look, if you know about something, by not reporting it you're every bit as culpable. Now, is there anything that you'd like to tell me?	No, no, I'm not even sure there is a problem. I'm running tests, I'm doing everything that I should be doing.
Oh, that's funny, because the only person who coulda given him insulin...	There's no infection. He's diabetic; so when someone gave him insulin during post-op, when he wasn't eating, he became hypoglycemic.	What happened?	Hi!	Negative? How could they be negative? The guy looks like death.
Me!I gave him insulin!	Uh-oh.	Oh, that's funny, because the only person who coulda given him insulin...	There's no infection. He's diabetic; so when someone gave him insulin during post-op, when he wasn't eating, he became hypoglycemic.	What happened?
Thank you so much. You totally saved my ass.	Well, he's fine, Bambi. I gave him an amp? of D-50 and he's eating, now. But you should probably give him a glass of orange juice in about an hour.	Twice!	Me!I gave him insulin!	Uh-oh.
Look, Turk....	Well, it wasn't me....	Thank you so much. You totally saved my ass.	Well, he's fine, Bambi. I gave him an amp? of D-50 and he's eating, now. But you should probably give him a glass of orange juice in about an hour.	Twice!
I know.	Come on, man; you know I always got your back.	Look, Turk....	Well, it wasn't me....	Thank you so much. You totally saved my ass.
I miss you so much it hurts, sometimes.	Just tell him how you feel without sounding like a girl, for once.	I know.	Come on, man; you know I always got your back.	Look, Turk....
Thank you.	Okay, um, you've had a rough day, so I'm gonna let that go for now.	I miss you so much it hurts, sometimes.	Just tell him how you feel without sounding like a girl, for once.	I know.
Oh, crap!	Look, we're gonna find time to hang, man. It's just that we're both really swamped right now, and I'm hanging out with Carla a lot, I know... But tell me, if there was someone you were into, you wouldn't be doing the same thing.	Thank you.	Okay, um, you've had a rough day, so I'm gonna let that go for now.	I miss you so much it hurts, sometimes.
Not gross, pretty. Come here.	No, I just ate, I feel gross.	Well, we can wait like, three, four seconds.	What? Right now?	You're right. Kiss me.
It never fails.	J.D., can we just... talk for a second?	Not gross, pretty. Come here.	No, I just ate, I feel gross.	Well, we can wait like, three, four seconds.
Uhh... would you guys mind....	Make 'em know you're a man, not a boy.	That'd be nice.	Honesty.... Well, I like that. You probably want these people to wait outside.	It's kinda too soon to tell.
Yes, please!	Want a hard candy?	Right... that's what I'm talkin' about.	Well, that was manly!	Everybody outta here, now!"Now!"
What's his name?	I know, I can't help it. I got a hernia patient to take care of.	You're using that "somebody called" joke a lot.	Dude, the League of Women Voters called and they want to know where to send your membership info.	I feel like you're missing out. Like, this Mrs. Tanner, she's got this...incredible energy and...and warmth.
He must feel so safe and taken care of.	Well, his name is Hernia Patient, but we've gotten close so I like to call him "Hernia".	What's his name?	I know, I can't help it. I got a hernia patient to take care of.	You're using that "somebody called" joke a lot.
What's that?	These labs don't look good; I think it's time she got started on dialysis.Oh, but you know what you should do first, kiddo?	Yeah... I ordered them.	We'll put her on diuretics.	Why?
Okay, here we go.Blow!	Candles are still lit.	Thank you. Come on, let's go.	You're very cute.	Okay, enough of this. I don't think any of you realize how serious this is. Right now we need to be worried about your mother, your grandmother... your....I'm sorry, we we haven't met, I'm Dr. Dorian.
Okay. "Number One: Eat a sausage-and-pepper hoagie from Enrico's."	Oh, no.	Speaking of which, I took the liberty of jotting down a few things I think everybody should do at least once in their life.	It didn't come up. Look, they don't need that burden; besides, they'd just give me a bunch of reasons to change my mind.	You didn't tell them, did you.
"Number Two: Go to Asia."	Well, of course I've done that.	Okay. "Number One: Eat a sausage-and-pepper hoagie from Enrico's."	Oh, no.	Speaking of which, I took the liberty of jotting down a few things I think everybody should do at least once in their life.
I'm gonna take that as a yes, and I'll also check off "Learn a foreign language".	Gonenn kan kurai Kyoto ni sunnde imashita.	"Number Two: Go to Asia."	Well, of course I've done that.	Okay. "Number One: Eat a sausage-and-pepper hoagie from Enrico's."
Me? No, no, I've I've been off for two hours.	Good, then we agree. Now, aren't there other patients you need to be seeing?	You have had an amazing life.	Listen, Dr. Dorian, there's not one thing I regret as I lay here right now. I'm ready. I really am.	No, I'm not; it's right here, you can look at it!
I will.	So, with your precious free time, you've been sitting in a hospital room talking to an old lady. What about your list? How many of those things have you done? For that matter, how many times have you sat in the grass and done nothing, hm?You need to start taking some time for yourself, young man. Promise me you'll do that.	Me? No, no, I've I've been off for two hours.	Good, then we agree. Now, aren't there other patients you need to be seeing?	You have had an amazing life.
Yeah, well, let me I just want to check out a few things before I...get going.Uh-huh.... Uhh-huh....	Good. Now, get outta here. Go on.	I will.

Dorian. You see me every day. Say my name; say it!	Well, excellent catch Dr..... uh... Dr.... uhm....	Well, he's dead.	Why would you think that's unnecessary?	I, uh.... Sir, I was going over Mr. Martinez's chart, and it seems like the TIPS procedure he's scheduled for is completely unnecessary.
That was the name of the patient, sir.	....Martinez.	Dorian. You see me every day. Say my name; say it!	Well, excellent catch Dr..... uh... Dr.... uhm....	Well, he's dead.

No, just 'cause you guys have been dating...for a while. Do Latina women put out more? Because that's not something I've I've ever heard.Turk told me.	Why would you think that Turk and I slept together? Because I'm a nurse? Because I'm Latina?	"What up...dude?"	What did you just say?	Once every 4.2 seconds a man says something stupid that a woman hears and punishes him for....Luckily, this wasn't one of those times.
Once every 6.3 seconds, a man says something stupid that another man hears and punishes him for...Luckily, this wasn't	I still think I was right.	Don't say it!	Well, geez, newbie, just what in the hell do you want from me, huh?I don't know if they taught you this in the land of fairies and puppy-dog tails, where you obviously, if not grew up then at least spent most of your summers, but you're in the real world now. Nnnnn-kay?	You don't have to be, like, mean about it.
Oh, no.	That's it!	Once every 6.3 seconds, a man says something stupid that another man hears and punishes him for...Luckily, this wasn't	I still think I was right.	Don't say it!
Is it really that bad?	Don't interrupt me. Come here;Pull that curtain. Mrs. Blitt over there needs the TIPS procedure, no insurance? Yeah, well, she can now look forward to a lifetime of encephalopathy and jaundice thanks to Bottom-Line Bob.	I accept!	Anyway, newbie, the reason I was all bent outta shape yesterday	Look at him, pretending like yesterday never happened. Well, if he thinks I'm gonna forgive him without so much as a
Totally.	I...hate...Robert Kelso. I hate his family, I hate his friends, I hate the guy that cleans his vaguely racist little lawn jockey; in fact, I hate anybody who ever even associates with him. Is that clear?	Is it really that bad?	Don't interrupt me. Come here;Pull that curtain. Mrs. Blitt over there needs the TIPS procedure, no insurance? Yeah, well, she can now look forward to a lifetime of encephalopathy and jaundice thanks to Bottom-Line Bob.	I accept!
Hell no!	Hell, yeah, I'm right! Screw Cox! ....I mean, you're not afraid of him, are you?	You're right.	Almost one. You know what, Cox doesn't need your help taking her down for a TIPS procedure. As a matter of fact, he shouldn't even be putting you in that situation!	How many has she had?
....Okay, maybe a little.	The Hospital Hallway	Hell no!	Hell, yeah, I'm right! Screw Cox! ....I mean, you're not afraid of him, are you?	You're right.
That's three!	That's four.	....Okay, maybe a little.	The Hospital Hallway	Hell no!
So is everyone else around here.Oh, that's not funny.	I'm waiting for the "but."	Oh, come on. Yes, exposing yourself to a dead guy might have been a tad unorthodox; and yes, it might be a little hard to live down....	At what point did I become a crazy person?	You know that's not even a real disease?
Come on. When I look at you, I look at a doctor who'll do whatever it takes to help a patient.	Thanks. Glad I shared.	So is everyone else around here.Oh, that's not funny.	I'm waiting for the "but."

So it was all a test.	What, are you kidding? It's way too big of a risk for a peon. Okay I just wanted to see what team you were playing for.	I just want you to know, if you still want my help, I'm on board.	The Admissions Area	And...on that note....
I think I liked it better when he didn't know my name.	Well, I guess that's your choice, isn't it... Dr. Dorian.	Actually, sir, I'm not really that in to golf.	You're suspended! Effective immediately.Well, sport, it looks like a permanent spot just opened up on the golf course. How does joining the Chief of Medicine for a weekly round sound?	NO!!!
Owww.	That's one for me.	I think I liked it better when he didn't know my name.	Well, I guess that's your choice, isn't it... Dr. Dorian.	Actually, sir, I'm not really that in to golf.
I'm hurt.	That's two.	Owww.	That's one for me.	I think I liked it better when he didn't know my name.
So this board member almost fainted? I'll fire up the paddles.	Pre-syncope.	What happened?	But for hypertrophic cardio-myopathy.	That can't be true. I hate that expression.
Sir, I'm confused.	Ah! Dr. Wisenheimer's back; how was your ski trip?	So this board member almost fainted? I'll fire up the paddles.	Pre-syncope.	What happened?
Oh, now I get it.	You annoy me.	Sir, I'm confused.	Ah! Dr. Wisenheimer's back; how was your ski trip?	So this board member almost fainted? I'll fire up the paddles.
Oh, great, an eighty-year-old, grouchy, pretentious	But you have this nauseating charm everyone else around here seems to respond to. Use it, okay, sport?	Oh, now I get it.	You annoy me.	Sir, I'm confused.
How sweet.	Like it matters. Look, you seem like a nice, spineless little boy, so let's be honest. I'm here because it was the only way to end my beast of a mother's nagging, pseudo-concern.	J.D.	Great. That's why I'm here. Listen, R.J.	Oh. I woulda said sorry back then, but I had a little trouble with my S's....I was five.... S's.... So... uh... how are you feeling?
Okay, well let me just check out	So, do your little tests; but first, close the blinds, wash off whatever eighth-grade dance cologne you're wearing so we don't add nausea to my symptoms, and I'll need lemon wedges for my sparkling water which, for some reason, you have yet to get me.	How sweet.	Like it matters. Look, you seem like a nice, spineless little boy, so let's be honest. I'm here because it was the only way to end my beast of a mother's nagging, pseudo-concern.	J.D.
Nice to meet you.	Doing things I want first, your little tests later.	Okay, well let me just check out	So, do your little tests; but first, close the blinds, wash off whatever eighth-grade dance cologne you're wearing so we don't add nausea to my symptoms, and I'll need lemon wedges for my sparkling water which, for some reason, you have yet to get me.	How sweet.
That's it!	Oh, I'm going to a party. I assume my tests are normal, or else you wouldn't be chatting me up.But, gosh, Huckleberry, I sure hope we can go down to the river sometime and race frogs!	Sorry. He's a.... Wait, wait, wh-why are you dressed?	Losing interest!	Look, I know that you're on the Board, and I have this friend well, he's not really a friend, he's more like a mentor....
Yes, ma'am.	Take off your pants.	Well, get used to it...missy.Uhm... I didn't mean to be such a hard-ass just now. You can totally wait until I'm gone to put your gown back on.	No one talks to me that way!	I'm the doctor, here. So put your gown back on, get back in bed, and shut the hell up.
...And timing.	He was released a couple-a hours ago.	...Dependence...	Oh, God.	The beginning of any relationship is really about three things: Control...
Other than that, there aren't really a whole lot of surprises.	Your mother broke her leg.	...And timing.	He was released a couple-a hours ago.	...Dependence...
I am so sorry.	The story of my life. Anytime I let my guard down just a little, I get hurt.	Okay... 'Jordan'Uh... I just don't think we should see each other again.	Honey, I think we're way past "Miss Sullivan".	Miss Sullivan? Excuse me, Miss Sullivan.
She's gonna be okay.	You know how long it's been since I connected with someone? You know, it's not fair that just because of him I don't get to spend time Boy, it's hard to keep that going! See ya, D.J., I got a date...."See each other again"...	I am so sorry.	The story of my life. Anytime I let my guard down just a little, I get hurt.	Okay... 'Jordan'Uh... I just don't think we should see each other again.
I wonder if he wants me to ask her?	I'm gonna go ahead and do this just as slowly as possible so you don't misunderstand: Nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnooooooooooooooooooooooo.	...Ask?	No!	Come on, she's on the board! Deep down, I'm sure she's a reasonable person.... Not that I know her that well, or at all, or have ever been alone with her.... But I'm sure if you just
That's a "no".	Fine. I'll ask her.	I wonder if he wants me to ask her?	I'm gonna go ahead and do this just as slowly as possible so you don't misunderstand: Nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnooooooooooooooooooooooo.	...Ask?
I think we both know that's not completely true.	Yeah, you had nothing to do with why we slept together.	Oh, thanks, that's that's special. Look, I have to ask you a favor, but you have to know this is not why we slept together.	I don't dislike you I nothing you.	Jordan!Look, I know you're on your way to the board meeting, and I know you don't really like me, but
Please don't do that.	Oh, please. Even though you're terrified the Good Dr. Cox'll find out, if I wanted you to go to his apartment right now and have sex with me in front of him, you would.	I think we both know that's not completely true.	Yeah, you had nothing to do with why we slept together.	Oh, thanks, that's that's special. Look, I have to ask you a favor, but you have to know this is not why we slept together.
Then, Jordan, look into your heart and see if you can dig up some sympathy for someone who means a whole lot to me; and probably means a little to you, too.So will you help him?	You know, you remind me of him when he was younger.	Please don't do that.	Oh, please. Even though you're terrified the Good Dr. Cox'll find out, if I wanted you to go to his apartment right now and have sex with me in front of him, you would.	I think we both know that's not completely true.
Stick with the truth, and you can't get hurt; it's just always been my philosophy.	Although, it did take some stones to be honest.	It felt good.	Well, geez, Agnes, does the field hockey team know that you're missing?	I'll always remember that moment as the first "thank you" I got from Dr. Cox.
God, no!	You didn't sleep with her, did you?	Stick with the truth, and you can't get hurt; it's just always been my philosophy.	Although, it did take some stones to be honest.	It felt good.
Well, the gurney adds drama.	Wow.	The only problem with reaching the top is that sooner or later someone starts nipping at your heels....For me, that guy was Nick Murdoch.	You know, it's it's okay to be impressed by me most girls are.	It's good to be the king.
Yeah, I know. I still feel like I'm seven years old, playing 'MASH' with my older brother.	Gosh, can you believe we're doctors? The other night, I'm at a restaurant and this guy starts choking. They asked if anyone was a doctor, I didn't even move!	Hey, how are you?Oh, okay. There there that is.	He was born John Dorian, but he was simply known as 'J.D.' Doctor. Friend. Lover.Hey, man, how are ya?	That's the...that's the stud, right there. That's where you'd...hang a painting.
Shut up, and kiss Frank.	I don't wanna be HotLips again!	Yeah, I know. I still feel like I'm seven years old, playing 'MASH' with my older brother.	Gosh, can you believe we're doctors? The other night, I'm at a restaurant and this guy starts choking. They asked if anyone was a doctor, I didn't even move!	Hey, how are you?Oh, okay. There there that is.
What are you doing? Don't connect with him.	I don't talk to my brother much.	Shut up, and kiss Frank.	I don't wanna be HotLips again!	Yeah, I know. I still feel like I'm seven years old, playing 'MASH' with my older brother.
Well, I'll see ya.	What are you doing? Don't connect with him.	I don't talk to my brother much.	Shut up, and kiss Frank.	I don't wanna be HotLips again!
Wait. Whatever happened to the guy in the restaurant?	Okay.	Well, I'll see ya.	What are you doing? Don't connect with him.	I don't talk to my brother much.
Don't laugh. Don't laugh!Damn!	Oh, eventually I remembered I was a doctor; 'course, he'd been dead for twenty minutes very embarrassing. Food was good, though.	Wait. Whatever happened to the guy in the restaurant?	Okay.	Well, I'll see ya.
It felt weird trying to push Nick on her. I mean, this morning I wanted to kill the guy; but the truth is, he's so nice, he probably would've helped me.	Did he look back, did he like me? Why doesn't he like me? I can't believe I already blew it.	Well, you could start by looking at him.	Oh... I'd let him drool on me. Oh, that's gross, why did I say that? I I shouldn't talk to people. Besides, I wouldn't know what to do even if I was interested.	How about Nick?
Please. Like he knows me.	Everyone looks up to you. It's important to them that you don't get stumped. Besides, come on, it's important to you, too.	Then why don't you just answer it?	It's Erythema Migrans.	Oh, my God, I'm drawing a.... Oh, my God, I can't even remember what you draw when your mind draws a...something!
Whoa!	See you tomorrow.	...if only for a moment.Or being selfless every once in a while.I don't know.I guess, in the end, it's about surviving......any way you can.	Okay....	The scariest thing was that I thought he was stronger than all of us. But maybe it's not about being the best. Maybe it's about finding the little things that get you through the day.Whether it's the support of someone close to you......or letting yourself feel overwhelmed...
That's it?	You're stupid.	Whoa!	See you tomorrow.	...if only for a moment.Or being selfless every once in a while.I don't know.I guess, in the end, it's about surviving......any way you can.
Am I stupid?	Give it time, it'll eat at ya.	That's it?	You're stupid.	Whoa!
Damn him!	Yeah, little bit.	Am I stupid?	Give it time, it'll eat at ya.	That's it?
Sir!No pulse.	Neil!	Oh, this is just, um, it's thirty-eight dollars in singles....I-I bought a newspaper, and this is the change from my forty.	So what's that in your pocket?	I'm worried about the kids.
Call an ambulance!	Starting CPR.	Sir!No pulse.	Neil!	Oh, this is just, um, it's thirty-eight dollars in singles....I-I bought a newspaper, and this is the change from my forty.
It's a proud day for women everywhere.	An A-plus. But, then I turned on the water-works and the resident changed it to an A-plus-plus.	Really, what'd you get?	Who cares? It's only a grade.	Life in a hospital moves so fast. One second you're a hero, the next, you're obsessing about intern evaluations.
Anything for the hospital, sir!	Excuse me?	Okay, whose breasts haven't I signed yet?It could happen!	It's just a pleasantry, sport; let's keep it moving. Listen, I've been thinking, with all the publicity you and your friend have been getting, it would be silly not to milk it a little bit see if we can't promote the hospital. What do you say?	Well, sir, these evaluations...
I'm I'm not...gonna bark like a	Say it right into the camera, there, hotshot. Now, you can have this thing back anytime you want. You're gonna have to bark like a dog, though.	Well, yeah....	Hey, Newbie. This thing actually does matter, so tell me, were you completely honest with yourself?	Enjoy. I think you'll find it's a good read.
Woof!	It's your call.	I'm I'm not...gonna bark like a	Say it right into the camera, there, hotshot. Now, you can have this thing back anytime you want. You're gonna have to bark like a dog, though.	Well, yeah....
Look, this is so unfair, you're supposed to do my evaluation not me. And, you know what? You're gonna do it, buddy-boy.	And that's when I realized, I'm not gonna let people take advantage of me anymore.	Come on, it's different this time. Now it's both of us.You can still see my hand on your shoulder.	Twice?Ohh? Ohh!	So what, they put you on the cover.
I'm serious.	"Buddy-boy"? Why...I...oughtta....	Look, this is so unfair, you're supposed to do my evaluation not me. And, you know what? You're gonna do it, buddy-boy.	And that's when I realized, I'm not gonna let people take advantage of me anymore.	Come on, it's different this time. Now it's both of us.You can still see my hand on your shoulder.
Well, if it's that easy, then it won't take you that long to do it.	Relax, Newbie. It's just an evaluation; it should be easy.	I'm serious.	"Buddy-boy"? Why...I...oughtta....	Look, this is so unfair, you're supposed to do my evaluation not me. And, you know what? You're gonna do it, buddy-boy.
When?	All right, well, don't you worry about it another minute, there, Newbie. I'll evaluate you, I'll evaluate the hell right outta ya.	Well, if it's that easy, then it won't take you that long to do it.	Relax, Newbie. It's just an evaluation; it should be easy.	I'm serious.
Fine!	Oh, just the second I get off work.	When?	All right, well, don't you worry about it another minute, there, Newbie. I'll evaluate you, I'll evaluate the hell right outta ya.	Well, if it's that easy, then it won't take you that long to do it.
Great!	Fine!	Fine!	Oh, just the second I get off work.	When?
Here it is.You get off, like, six-ish, er...?	Great!	Great!	Fine!	Fine!
Keep it real!	Hit me one.	I love you, man.	It's okay; your intentions were good, and there's never been an issue of race between us. Since the day I met you, you've been nothing but a friend to me.	Hey, Turk. Look, I'm really sorry about the whole poster thing. It was racially insensitive of me; I should have been more aware of your feelings before I went ahead and spoke for you.
Well, I once tripped over an I.V. and blood shot over everyone! Er uh a little got on my nose… Every damn day saving those children!	I was laughing so hard milk was coming out of my nose.	I know two things about bars, one they're always packed the week of Thanksgiving and two put a beer in my hand and I'm Mr. Smooth.	It's on, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on!	I do what I can.
Right.	Who wants margaritas? Dude, less blood more fruity drinks.	Well, I once tripped over an I.V. and blood shot over everyone! Er uh a little got on my nose… Every damn day saving those children!

That sounds like a Fat Albert joke.Don't worry about it man I feel good tonight, you know what I'm saying?. Except for this stabbing pain in my side.	Because you're like a 24 hour convenience store. You never close.	Why do you say that?	Dude, this girl's pretty hot, so try not to blow it. Okay?	That's the thing about Turk he hasn't changed a bit since college. He's still the same goofball who tells me how to be cooler.
Dude!	So he was up all night with a high fever, cramping and crying.	That sounds like a Fat Albert joke.Don't worry about it man I feel good tonight, you know what I'm saying?.

Cold hands.	I'll write, rare dry spell in the margin. Okay time for the physical	Oh it's active.	Oh, you're making this so much easier! Are you sexually active?	No, no, is it a problem if it whistles?
What annoying thing?	I don't know Dr. Benson was kind of my mentor, so don't do that annoying thing.	I'm still puking every hour and my fever's pretty high but you're sure it's okay for me to be out of bed right?	See that wasn't so bad. All done.	Ow!
Come on that's a little-	You know when you talk.	What annoying thing?	I don't know Dr. Benson was kind of my mentor, so don't do that annoying thing.	I'm still puking every hour and my fever's pretty high but you're sure it's okay for me to be out of bed right?
He can say what he wants. The bottom line is he's showing me off.Watching Dr. Cox I realized we never really stop craving the attention of people we look up to.	See there it is. How does that not drive you crazy?I know you're all excited because got the gown on but under no circumstance are you to curtsy.	Come on that's a little-	You know when you talk.	What annoying thing?

You have a Chicago? Be nice to me, I'm getting surgery.	You mean Chicago?	Do they celebrate Thanksgiving in your homeland?	Not really.	I can't believe I have to spend all Thanksgiving here. Tell me that wouldn't kill you.
Yeah but who's the intern who's gonna do all the work?	Dr. Wen's the attending.	You have a Chicago? Be nice to me, I'm getting surgery.	You mean Chicago?	Do they celebrate Thanksgiving in your homeland?

The best thing about good friends is how quickly things like this blow over.	Fair enough. Dr. Kotter will perform the procedure tomorrow morning.	Sir I'd prefer it if someone other than Dr. Turk performed the surgery.	Dude! I'm about to bust a mad slizzice in your insides!	After all he's a highly trained competent young doctor.
What do you mean like school in July?	I can't believe you, I would never ever do something like this to you. You're like school in July.	You want some salsa for that chip on your shoulder?	Whatever man.	You understand right?
Dude she rocks.	I wanna be the one inside you.Look J.D. I get it. I mean to me you'll always be that geeky kid with the Pat Benatar T-Shirt on.	No seriously man, I want you to know if I ever need surgery again I want you inside of me.	It's okay man.	Turk I was an idiot

I guess what they say is true the people you work with really do become your family. Like your brother, and your sister in law, or that cousin you have funny feelings for,. and the crazy angry uncle everyone sort of hopes isn't coming this year.	Happy Thanksgiving man.

It's just a bench.	J.D., I've had such a crappy morning in this hell-hole that I decided to come out here and eat my lunch. This spot feels secluded I mean, it's so peaceful. I feel like I'm getting my spirit back.	Yeah; I'm okay with it.	You realize you're annoying me?	Yeah, see, there ya go.So, what are you doin'?
Nice. You know, I've already eaten, but I suppose I could	Sit down, sweet thing. Sit down.	It's just a bench.

Your cupcake.This is how I get _my_ spirit back.Mmm-mmm! ...I feel _alive_ again! I feel alive again! Alive again! I feel alive....!	Okay, what's it gonna take for you to leave this second?	Nice. You know, I've already eaten, but I suppose I could	Sit down, sweet thing. Sit down.	It's just a bench.
Morning.	Okay. You know what? It's time to change this pattern.	Your cupcake.This is how I get _my_ spirit back.Mmm-mmm! ...I feel _alive_ again! I feel alive again! Alive again! I feel alive....!	Okay, what's it gonna take for you to leave this second?	Nice. You know, I've already eaten, but I suppose I could
Just doing a little drilling, huh?	How do you figure?	Morning.	Okay. You know what? It's time to change this pattern.	Your cupcake.This is how I get _my_ spirit back.Mmm-mmm! ...I feel _alive_ again! I feel alive again! Alive again! I feel alive....!
Look, I have an idea: Let's try and go the whole day without getting in each other's hair; you know, just...give each other a break...? What do you say?	Yeah.	Just doing a little drilling, huh?	How do you figure?	Morning.
That that's good, but you know, I already I have a nickname; it's...it's "J.D."	I'm gonna give you a nickname.

The future of the relationship depends on how she handles that very moment.	Uhhhh...actually, Carla, I think, because of the congestive heart failure, he just needs Lasix.	You see, when you start out, the nurses know more than you. But after a few months, the training kicks in and you both feel the dynamic shift.	His O-2 set's dropping; I think he just needs respiratory treatment.	It's hard for doctors and nurses to be long-term friends....
Take it back.	Oh, come on, it wasn't even that good a show.	Okay, how 'bout a little of this.	What up, Raj!	Hey-hey-hey what's happenin', Rerun.
Are we still on for that, uh, Bresson exhibit?	This second.Ooh, look at the time! Gotta go it's lunch-time! See you, Baby!	Take it back.	Oh, come on, it wasn't even that good a show.	Okay, how 'bout a little of this.
Yes.	Discharge summaries?	Yes.	Did you do your pre-rounds?	After working at a hospital for a while, you develop a sixth sense for danger.Maybe there's a mass cas. alert...maybe there's a code.......Maybe someone spent the morning with the most annoying patient in the world and needs to vent.Luckily, I was prepared.
Yes!	Pharmacy renewals?	Yes.	Discharge summaries?	Yes.
Yes.	S.O.A.P. notes?	Yes!	Pharmacy renewals?	Yes.
Yes.	Central line changes.	Yes.	S.O.A.P. notes?	Yes!
...Yes.	Okay, Janet. But...did you go ahead and fix your beeper so it doesn't play that annoying song every single time you get paged?	Yes.	Central line changes.	Yes.
It's not fair. Wait, why are you eating in here?	You wanna kick and scream while you're teaching people here, that's fine. But if you _ever_ yell at my friend again over _nothing_, then I will personally wipe that scary smile off your face, put it in my purse, and keep it there until no one around here is any more scared of you than I am.	Yeah; you know what really pisses me off? Is that no one ever calls him on anything, you know?	So Cox tore into you, huh?	Pain.
Carla, I do not think	I don't work with Turk! And I'm not that close to Elliot. The only problem here is _you_, okay? We're supposed to be friends. Your self-esteem is so wrapped up in what you do. You're a doctor that's all you are, that's how you define yourself. And you think that you're better than me because of it.	Look, Carla, if it's a problem, then you, me, and Elliot and Turk, we'll get together and	I've had hundreds of interns decide that they don't need me anymore. Why should You see, this is why you can't be friends with doctors.	Oh, thank goodness; 'cause I thought you were mad at me.
Okay, sometimes that's true.Carla, you're a good nurse.	Admit it. Admit it right now, or I'll never respect you again.	Carla, I do not think	I don't work with Turk! And I'm not that close to Elliot.

And you think that you're better than me because of it.	Look, Carla, if it's a problem, then you, me, and Elliot and Turk, we'll get together and
Please wait.	I'm a _great_ nurse; you patronizing ass.You don't even get it, do you? For nine years, I never once felt bad about myself for what I do not for one second. And then I met you.	Okay, sometimes that's true.Carla, you're a good nurse.	Admit it. Admit it right now, or I'll never respect you again.	Carla, I do not think
He's actually very talented.	See you tomorrow, Scooter.	From that moment on, I knew I'd be "Bambi" forever.	You know the answer to that; don't do that. But thanks, Bambi.	Hey, Carla, how many M.A.Q.s of potassium should I give this guy?
Heyyy.I'm sorry, but it's been two weeks and your son shows no neurological improvement.	Hey, everybody!	I hate him.....but not as much as moments like these. There's nothing I can do for that guy, and yet, when I go in there, the whole family's gonna look at me like I got some magical power to fix him.	Hey, Randy, Jackie, whatta ya say? This is the monkey I got to videotape the birth.	Huh!
Oh, you're ridiculous.	It was a miracle! First of all, the man was damn-near dead; then he comes out!	Heyyy.I'm sorry, but it's been two weeks and your son shows no neurological improvement.

There's nothing I can do for that guy, and yet, when I go in there, the whole family's gonna look at me like I got some magical power to fix him.
It was not a miracle!	He was damn-near J.D., I'm telling you, it was a miracle!	Oh, you're ridiculous.	It was a miracle! First of all, the man was damn-near dead; then he comes out!	Heyyy.I'm sorry, but it's been two weeks and your son shows no neurological improvement.
I kind of envy Turk to be that sure of something, to have that faith of course, that doesn't mean I don't love busting him about it.	Yes it _was_ a miracle! Dude!	It was not a miracle!	He was damn-near J.D., I'm telling you, it was a miracle!	Oh, you're ridiculous.
I can't believe I'm wearing a suit at 6:30 in the morning.	You see, maybe it's because Christmas is a hard time for people, maybe it's because too many families get together, but, statistically, Christmas Eve it's one of the worst nights of the year to be on-call.	At least I can go home now.	Don't kid yourself, Newbie I couldn't _be_any madder at you!Oh! Ah! Do _not_ do that again! That's a bad newbie! Oh, bad! Oh, bad!Bad!Ah! Oh! Oh! Oh! Bad newbie!	You know, if he was really mad at me, he would've stayed and yelled at me.
Noted.	If you ruin this for Turk, I'll have to hurt you.	I can't believe I'm wearing a suit at 6:30 in the morning.	You see, maybe it's because Christmas is a hard time for people, maybe it's because too many families get together, but, statistically, Christmas Eve it's one of the worst nights of the year to be on-call.

Yep; definitely. Shave and a hair-cut...two bits.	Well, it's standard procedure, what with the recent outbreak of pre-natal lice.	Shaved it....	You shaved the baby?	We shaved the baby.
They can help you find something you thought you'd lost.	Aw! Look at the baby!	Because a baby can stir something deep down inside you you didn't even know was there.	What up, little dawg!	I really think it's impossible to be unaffected.
Hellooo.	Ooh, a firm handshake. I like that.	Nice to meet you.	Alex Hanson.	Hello!How are ya, I'm Dr. Dorian.
I can't; you were knocked unconscious, you could have a serious head injury. Just be glad you're not claustrophobic.	Well, pull me the hell out of here!	Well, stuck is such a literal term. It's more like, not moving.	Oh, my God! Is it stuck!?	Not that good a sound.
I promise.Dr. Cox must have my pager on speed dial. He's completely on top of me today.	Promise you won't leave me.	I can't; you were knocked unconscious, you could have a serious head injury. Just be glad you're not claustrophobic.	Well, pull me the hell out of here!	Well, stuck is such a literal term. It's more like, not moving.
That's naughty!	Oh, do you know how much I wish Dr. Cox was on top of me?	I promise.Dr. Cox must have my pager on speed dial. He's completely on top of me today.	Promise you won't leave me.	I can't; you were knocked unconscious, you could have a serious head injury. Just be glad you're not claustrophobic.
Oh, come on, you're over-reacting a little bit.	You make me so mad, I might actually scream! Every day you bitch and you bitch about how hard Dr. Cox is on you, and you don't even realize that you're his go-to guy.	That's naughty!	Oh, do you know how much I wish Dr. Cox was on top of me?	I promise.Dr. Cox must have my pager on speed dial. He's completely on top of me today.
Ummm.... He had me intubate and extubate Mrs. Pollard; float a Swan on Mr. Caulca; and then do two thoracenteses, a paracentesis, a radial art. line...oh, and then place a transvenous pacemaker for a complete heart-block. Why? What did you do?	What has he had you do today? Hm?	Oh, come on, you're over-reacting a little bit.	You make me so mad, I might actually scream! Every day you bitch and you bitch about how hard Dr. Cox is on you, and you don't even realize that you're his go-to guy.	That's naughty!
He takes it sugar, no cream.	Oh, uh....Cream. No sugar.	Ummm.... He had me intubate and extubate Mrs. Pollard; float a Swan on Mr. Caulca; and then do two thoracenteses, a paracentesis, a radial art. line...oh, and then place a transvenous pacemaker for a complete heart-block. Why? What did you do?	What has he had you do today? Hm?	Oh, come on, you're over-reacting a little bit.
I am so in.I'm right back out.	I'll tell you what I'm not doing: I'm not checking for a wedding ring....	Why are you squeezing all my fingers?	Why am I always in your fantasies!? You got a problem, man!	Whoa.... It really feels like there's something going on, here. I wonder what she looks like?
Ohhh....ohh....are you sure? 'Cause....okay.Ah! I gotta go. Sorry.	I'm kidding! You don't have to take me out to dinner.	You know, you're not a bad guy if you wanna wait and see what she looks like.	Oh. So, what, uh, restaurant are you taking me to?	Uhh, Alex, he's gone.
But I still do it. Get back in the game, Elliot.	You're afraid.	I don't know...I just thought it'd be hot. Elliot, he's testing you. If you ever want Cox to respect you, you can't be afraid to disagree with him.	What does that have to do with anything?	Fine, why don't you just quit, become a lesbian, and hook up with some hot model?
It's iffy.	If I say no, will you still let me out of this thing?	Will you go out with me?	What the hell are you doing!?	Wait! Stop the machine!
So, say it.	Then I guess I have to say yes, don't I?	It's iffy.	If I say no, will you still let me out of this thing?	Will you go out with me?
Huh.	Sure. I'd love to.	So, say it.	Then I guess I have to say yes, don't I?	It's iffy.
Yeah, that's me.	But the page is addressed to Lillian.	Oh, it's Cox he wants me back at the hospital.	Nooo!	...Killed our first raccoon.Ever since then, every date we've been on has always ended the same way.
That was probably the wrong time to ask for a quickie.	What a drag....	Yeah, that's me.	But the page is addressed to Lillian.	Oh, it's Cox he wants me back at the hospital.
Not really.	Okay.There. Now no one gets to eat it! Ya happy?	Staring....	What are you doing?	Eating.

Yeah, like, let's say for instance you wanted to watch a movie we could just go to the conference room and watch that video on S.T.D.s. It's funny, and it makes you think!	Hm?

But if you didn't know Dr. Cox like I did, you'd have believed his performance, too.I guess the key to a lot of things is balance. Whether it's balance of power...	...ridiculous! Now get the hell out of my I.C.U! I'm taking over!	...maybe he just hated rounds, I don't know.	How on earth are they ever going to learn anything....	Maybe he felt sorry for Kelso and didn't want to take away the one thing the guy had.
...balance in love......or sometimes just balance.For some of us, it seems too far out of reach......too difficult to achieve.....But the important thing is just to never stop trying......especially if you like girls named Alex...and chicken salad.

I was talking to her.	I don't know.... I think most of the bad things that happen around here are your fault.	I just don't think it's my fault he quit.	J.D. standing against the doorframe looking into the Admissions Area.	It's not like I forced him to quit.
Even Nurse Roberts says he's the most incompetent young doctor she's ever worked with.	Well, I'm not gonna tell you what you wanna hear.	I was talking to her.	I don't know.... I think most of the bad things that happen around here are your fault.	I just don't think it's my fault he quit.

Are you bummed out that we have the same name?Oh, don't don't worry about it, man; I'll tell you what you're a little bit older than I am, so you were J.D. first. So how about you'll be J.D. Number One, and I'll just be J.D. Number Two. How about that?
Number One!All right, cool.	Hey, Number Two!	Okay.	Yeah.	Hey Number One. So, uh, I've got one more patient, do you want to have lunch in ten minutes and you can bring my clipboard?
Number One!	Hey, Number Two!	Number One!All right, cool.	Hey, Number Two!	Okay.
No, sir, I was just trying to assess how you're	I was just asking Nurse Fajita here if you guys get extra points for asking stupid questions.	Okay, Mr. Simon. Good morning, how you feeling?	About time. Idiot.	I honestly think the best part about working here is the patients. When they see how much you care, they're always grateful.
Carla, please. Sir, if there's anything I can do to make your stay here more comfortable	Bambi. Don't bother.	No, sir, I was just trying to assess how you're	I was just asking Nurse Fajita here if you guys get extra points for asking stupid questions.	Okay, Mr. Simon. Good morning, how you feeling?
Okay. Will you hold me after?Maybe we shouldn't bother.	You can kiss my man-sized ass!	Carla, please. Sir, if there's anything I can do to make your stay here more comfortable	Bambi. Don't bother.	No, sir, I was just trying to assess how you're
Hey, Number One.	Hey, Number Two!	Frank used to be a Navy SEAL.	Frank.	Which one?
Yes, once.	Son, you go back to bed, I'm fixing Mommy's back.	Mommy, are you and Daddy playing wheelbarrow?	J.D., when you were a kid, did you used to walk into your parent's room in the middle of the night?	Just thought I'd talk to you guys.
Peace out, Turk!	Mmm-hmm.	You're right. Argh...thank you, Carla.	Well, could have been the neglect. Could have been the terminal cancer. Bambi, you're a conscientious doctor, you'd never do anything to hurt a patient, you know that.	I just can't stop thinking about Mr. Simon. I neglected him because he was such a jerk; and I'm just kinda worried that's what killed him.
We all know what goes on in the bedroom...	Night.	Peace out, Turk!	Mmm-hmm.	You're right. Argh...thank you, Carla.
Still, there's no reason to start obsessing. You did nothing wrong.	Okay.	Is it hot in here? It's, like, it's hot!No, I'm fine.	Bambi. Don't be nervous.	Morbidity and Mortality conferences are just fun little meetings they have when they think you may be in any way responsible for a patient's death.
Okay, listen, I know we have the same name, and I feel very bad about that; but I can't spend every second of my day playing this game with you. I'm sorry, I...	Number Two!	Okay, you have to stop doing that. Look, Number One	Hey, Number Two!	Hey, Number One.
You know, it's, uh it's barely misting out...	But your drug addicts, your child abusers, your garden-variety jerks... Man.	Uh huh.	I have to warn you, I just got dumped in front of my ex-wife not ten minutes ago, okay Betty? It's always easy to treat the nice ones nice, isn't it?	Depends what you mean by different, I
Mine too!	It's my hair, if it even gets damp, it frizzes out and becomes wildly unmanageable.	You know, it's, uh it's barely misting out...	But your drug addicts, your child abusers, your garden-variety jerks... Man.	Uh huh.
It’s all right.	I could tell my friends were pretty upset. Still, there was a bright side....	Oh, I am so sorry.	Our parents are coming.	And that’s when Elliot said something that explained everything.
You missed a spot!	...I knew I could make it worse.	It’s all right.	I could tell my friends were pretty upset. Still, there was a bright side....	Oh, I am so sorry.
I like the pictures.	You know, you can help. You can't even hear the television!	You missed a spot!	...I knew I could make it worse.	It’s all right.
Hey, Dad. No, no, nothing. Turk and Elliot are freaking out because their parents are coming to visit.	If I believed in karma, I might be a little more cautious about giving these guys a hard time...	I like the pictures.	You know, you can help. You can't even hear the television!	You missed a spot!
No, no, no, no, it hasn't been that long since you and I saw each other.Dad...	But karma doesn't scare me!	Hey, Dad. No, no, nothing. Turk and Elliot are freaking out because their parents are coming to visit.	If I believed in karma, I might be a little more cautious about giving these guys a hard time...	I like the pictures.
Ooo! Ooo!	It's like... working with a monkey!	Yeah...	Look, Reba, if I ask you a question that doesn't specifically deal with a medical issue, you can bet your powdered bottom that I don't want you to answer. Do you understand?	Well, sort of. Elliot and Turk wrote this paper and then my dad decided "I want to come, too!"
Nothing.	What?	Ooo! Ooo!	It's like... working with a monkey!	Yeah...
Nice meeting you.	Oh, aggressive, huh? Do you really want to get it on with me, Pipsqueak? Because if you do, I guarantee it'll be the last stupid thing you ever do on God's green earth.	Excuse me?	You can help me by minding your own damn business!	Can I help you, sir? Sir?
That sucks. I totally wanted to spend some time with my dad tomorrow.	Thanks, man.	Actually, I	Hey, I have to give the med students a lecture on heart murmurs tomorrow. Could you cover for me?	He can't be that mad. We both know that even though residents are supposed to teach you, they really only show up when they want something.
What do you mean?	Then take him?	That sucks. I totally wanted to spend some time with my dad tomorrow.	Thanks, man.	Actually, I
I don't I don't think you really get my dad. He's not really interested in my work. He's more like a buddy.	Uh, I don't know, secure a vehicle of some kind car, balloon, tricycle and transport your father from wherever he is to where you're going to be.	What do you mean?	Then take him?	That sucks. I totally wanted to spend some time with my dad tomorrow.
The thing is, I don't really need a buddy. What I need is a father.	Ohhh-kay, that was my mistake. Here I engaged you and gave you the impression that I actually care which is just so wrong! God!	I don't I don't think you really get my dad. He's not really interested in my work. He's more like a buddy.	Uh, I don't know, secure a vehicle of some kind car, balloon, tricycle and transport your father from wherever he is to where you're going to be.	What do you mean?
I have testicles.He's he's a kidder! Heh.	Well, you definitely need something. Um, maybe a backbone, or perhaps some testicles. At the very least, a pillow that you could carry around the hospital and just cry your sad eyes out into whenever drama occures.	The thing is, I don't really need a buddy. What I need is a father.	Ohhh-kay, that was my mistake. Here I engaged you and gave you the impression that I actually care which is just so wrong! God!	I don't I don't think you really get my dad. He's not really interested in my work. He's more like a buddy.
That means a lot, Dad.	Are you kidding? I'd love to come to your heart murmur lecture! I'm a big fan of those things!	And that's when I decided to take a chance.	I know! Lemme tell ya, there are no gratuitous winks in the Reid household. It's like...	If that's not saying, "I love you and I'm proud of you," I'm not really sure what is.
Well, remember on Thanksgiving when I said your turkey was dry and you picked me up and shook me?	After all these years, are you still afraid of me?	Well, uhh, umm...	John Dorian, get over here.	Hi, Ms. Turk.
There's no food on your tray.	Hi...	I always thought parents were like tornadoes.They blow into town and devastate everything in their path.	Yeah, I prefer to call them dreams. I'm gonna-I'm gonna steal another Jell-o.	But Dad, you sell office supplies.
But it's different for me.	Oh.	There's no food on your tray.	Hi...	I always thought parents were like tornadoes.They blow into town and devastate everything in their path.
No.	How you doin', Elliot?Great talk. Uh, anyway, Johnny, I was talking to my buddy Jake this afternoon. You remember my buddy Jake?	But it's different for me.	Oh.	There's no food on your tray.
Right!	Well, anwyay, Jake's my buddy and he's leaving the country for who knows how long so I thought I might get out of here tomorrow afternoon and go catch up with him which would mean I'd miss your thing but I wouldn't know what I was hearing anyway. Right?	No.	How you doin', Elliot?Great talk. Uh, anyway, Johnny, I was talking to my buddy Jake this afternoon. You remember my buddy Jake?	But it's different for me.
Arrrrgh!	Fantastic!	I meant that later I'm not that busy	Well, if you're not that busy, then you have time to do this discharge summary for me.	Yeah, I'm not that busy.
I skipped lunch but I've been snacking all day.	Are you in jail? Have you been beaten? Are you malnourished?	What? No!	I'm sorry, um, you're not on drugs, are you?	My dad flaked on me again.
Well, he did some considerable emotional damage, so...	You are, in fact, a perfectly healthy twenty-six-year-old doctor who keeps crying about how horrible his father was.	I skipped lunch but I've been snacking all day.	Are you in jail? Have you been beaten? Are you malnourished?	What? No!
Hey, Dad.	But then I stopped thinking of my dad as a father, and started thinking of him as a man. And I realized some things that deep down I probably always knew. Like, maybe he wasn't crashing on my couch to spend more quality time with me but because he couldn't afford a hotel room.And maybe he wasn't going to see his buddy Jake to catch up, but because Jake was someone he might be able to sell something to and he really needs a sale.And maybe the truth is, he's just a middle-aged lonely guy trying to get by and it sure would be nice if someone would give him a break once and a while.	If it's okay with you, we just won't talk right now. Got a needle. Need to focus.	So... how's it going down there?	Part of me thought Cox was wrong and I had every reason to be angry with my father.
You know, I did, but I got someone to cover for me because I wanted to make sure I caught you and let you know how cool it was to see you.	Hey, there he is! I thought you had to work all day.	Hey, Dad.	But then I stopped thinking of my dad as a father, and started thinking of him as a man. And I realized some things that deep down I probably always knew. Like, maybe he wasn't crashing on my couch to spend more quality time with me but because he couldn't afford a hotel room.And maybe he wasn't going to see his buddy Jake to catch up, but because Jake was someone he might be able to sell something to and he really needs a sale.And maybe the truth is, he's just a middle-aged lonely guy trying to get by and it sure would be nice if someone would give him a break once and a while.

Yeah.	Really?	You know, I did, but I got someone to cover for me because I wanted to make sure I caught you and let you know how cool it was to see you.	Hey, there he is! I thought you had to work all day.	Hey, Dad.
That would be really great.	Well... Well, listen, I, um, you know, I have to travel a lot lately so I'm sure I'll be back in this region again soon. I could swing back out to see you.	Yeah.	Really?	You know, I did, but I got someone to cover for me because I wanted to make sure I caught you and let you know how cool it was to see you.
Great.	Great.	That would be really great.	Well... Well, listen, I, um, you know, I have to travel a lot lately so I'm sure I'll be back in this region again soon. I could swing back out to see you.	Yeah.
I see you've been taking advantage of the farting policy.	Great. I'd be happy to see you.	Great.	Great.	That would be really great.
I'm not gonna pull your finger!	Hey, pull my finger!	I see you've been taking advantage of the farting policy.	Great. I'd be happy to see you.	Great.
No, see, I paid seventeen dollars for this steak, and I'm not gonna....You want some?	Steak: The first person to finish their steak is the winner of Steak.	What?	Let's play Steak.	Turk turns everything in to a competition. It can get kind of annoying.
The problem is, these stupid games always seem to end the same way.	Uh-huh.Ankles is a simple game: The first one to get embarrassed and pull up their scrubs loses.	No, see, I paid seventeen dollars for this steak, and I'm not gonna....You want some?	Steak: The first person to finish their steak is the winner of Steak.	What?
I'm your beeyotch.	HA! HahahahaHA! Say it!Say it!Just say it.	The problem is, these stupid games always seem to end the same way.	Uh-huh.Ankles is a simple game: The first one to get embarrassed and pull up their scrubs loses.	No, see, I paid seventeen dollars for this steak, and I'm not gonna....You want some?
You're getting a meat plate for dinner!	I'm gonna go with surgery.	I can't believe you're turning this into a competition. Luckily, it's not up to you it's up to Mr. Hoffner.	How frequent?	That's why we're gonna give him frequent colonoscopies!
Oh yeah?	That's just the lamest smack-talk I've ever heard in my life.	Benedict Arnold?	What?	What's up, Benedict.
Well, that's not what the red-coats thought!	Yeah.	Oh yeah?	That's just the lamest smack-talk I've ever heard in my life.	Benedict Arnold?
So, what's up, man? You're gonna go under the knife just 'cause that guy told you to?	Wow! You went Colonial on his ass!	Well, that's not what the red-coats thought!	Yeah.	Oh yeah?
Like who?	No, I spoke to some other people.	So, what's up, man? You're gonna go under the knife just 'cause that guy told you to?	Wow! You went Colonial on his ass!	Well, that's not what the red-coats thought!
He's a janitor!	All fixed.	Like who?	No, I spoke to some other people.	So, what's up, man? You're gonna go under the knife just 'cause that guy told you to?
Oh, you know, that sounds like a great friendship.	You're damn right I'm competitive. See, that's what makes me a good doctor I want to win at everything every day, and you should, too.	Excuse me?	Tough.	That was my patient, Turk! I brought you in as my friend, and you're so damn competitive you just go ahead and take him from me? That sucks!
He never got the concept of the team.	Dude, if you don't wanna play Steak again, that's fine, all right? This has nothing to do with friendship, and you know it! So stop blaming me, because the truth is you're angry at yourself 'cause you couldn't get the guy to believe in you!	Oh, you know, that sounds like a great friendship.	You're damn right I'm competitive. See, that's what makes me a good doctor I want to win at everything every day, and you should, too.	Excuse me?
I win at Cookie.	I know. Have a cookie, man.	He never got the concept of the team.	Dude, if you don't wanna play Steak again, that's fine, all right? This has nothing to do with friendship, and you know it! So stop blaming me, because the truth is you're angry at yourself 'cause you couldn't get the guy to believe in you!	Oh, you know, that sounds like a great friendship.
Could somebody get that?	No big deal at all!	Nurse Roberts is gonna take a blood sample so we can check your Hepatitis viral load absolutely no big deal.	Can we get a move on, Q-Tip? I got tickets to "Bring in Da Noise, Bring in Da Funk" and I don't want to miss The Noise.	And I was having problems with my lady, too.
Hey, here's your pen.	Um, I'm I'm sure you'll be fine.	Thanks. That's, uh, that's comforting.	If you should develop any symptoms that suggest you may have contracted Hepatitis B, this form simply states the hospital is not responsible.	What's this?
The curse of the scrubs machine one of the hospital's most annoying money savers. The only way to get clean scrubs out is to put dirty ones in.	I can't find my scrubs top! I must have left it at Sean's.	She got some aaaction!Come on...it's funny!	Ugh!	Somebody got some a action!
Okay.	Just go!	How else can I help?	Give me your shirt.	How can I help?
No. Oh, come on, I have problems, too!	This stuff doesn't come as easy to me as it does for you, okay? I study every night, and you know what else I have to do to try and remember all this crap? I tape-record myself saying it, and then I listen to myself over and over. Do you have any idea how annoying it is to hear myself go on and on and on...and on...and on...?	What's your problem?	Shut up!	You knew the answer to that.
I traded my meningitis patient just traded him, like a baseball card. And you wanna know why? Because I was afraid of him!I'm a doctor who's afraid of sick people! You wanna take a picture with me?

Fantastic.	No. Because, aside from his weird Judy Bloom obsession, I like him. You will be de-lousing Mr. Schaffer guy's like fly-paper!	Thank you. Now, can I have my patient back?	Well, gosh, Newbie, I don't know what it was about that day. Maybe I hadn't had enough sleep. Maybe my mind was on other things. Maybe I didn't have enough fiber in my diet, and I failed to do my morning business. I don't know what the hell it was, but the bottom line is I didn't feel like spelling it out for you. And I know, I know, you want your little speech, and that's fine because here it is: You're a doctor. You might get sick. Get over it.	No, see, you're full of it you knew I was scared, why didn't you just tell me to go in there and deal with it?
You know, when you start med school they warn you that you're gonna have to make sacrifices.... But I guess that means different things to different people.	Oh, and, Belinda? D'you know what else is real contagious?A big ol' smile!	Fantastic.	No. Because, aside from his weird Judy Bloom obsession, I like him. You will be de-lousing Mr. Schaffer guy's like fly-paper!	Thank you. Now, can I have my patient back?

Thank you....Look here: My friend needs you to check on the Ben Sullivan file, and you're gonna do it right now. Why? Because you're not gonna drop the ball like you did on my patient.

If we're gonna beat this thing, and we damn sure are, we're gonna do it one way and one way only. We're gonna be a team! We're gonna be a team, team, team, team, team! You hear me?	But I didn't even say anything.
It's funny how people handle bad news in different ways.Some people have a visceral reaction...	Newbie, stop!	Oh, I don't mind, I just	Well, you're just an absolute lamb but you don't have to do that.	Dr. Cox, Ben seemed pretty down after you left so I thought I could cover for you and you could go hang out with him.
Some people go into denial...	Time to get my soapy soap on!	It's funny how people handle bad news in different ways.Some people have a visceral reaction...	Newbie, stop!	Oh, I don't mind, I just
And others...	No way.	Some people go into denial...	Time to get my soapy soap on!	It's funny how people handle bad news in different ways.Some people have a visceral reaction...
...Others just walk away.Chemotherapy looks harmless, but it's really poison pumped directly into your veins.	What chance do you give a guy with Ben's blast percentage, huh? Twenty percent, thirty, maybe? You see, I can't handle that. I cannot. So, no thank you there, Johnny.	And others...	No way.	Some people go into denial...
Look, Dr. Cox, I've been doing a lot of thinking and I honestly think that the only reason you're not down at that hospital right now is that you're afraid.	That's right! You run away! Run away from the truth!	How are you doing this?	You like the way cashmere feels on your skin!	That's not uncommon.
You gotta get back in the game, Coxie!Okay, Coxie was a mistake. Pretend I didn't say Coxie.	I think you're right. I do. Partly because you've really... gotten to know me this year.But mostly it's because, well... I told you that I was afraid earlier today so please don't tell me that you've come here to reiterate things to me that I've already said because I know the things I've already said. In fact... I'm the one who said them.	Look, Dr. Cox, I've been doing a lot of thinking and I honestly think that the only reason you're not down at that hospital right now is that you're afraid.	That's right! You run away! Run away from the truth!	How are you doing this?
Look, it boggles my mind that you just bail on a patient!	Geeeet out.	You gotta get back in the game, Coxie!Okay, Coxie was a mistake. Pretend I didn't say Coxie.	I think you're right. I do. Partly because you've really... gotten to know me this year.But mostly it's because, well...

I'm the one who said them.	Look, Dr. Cox, I've been doing a lot of thinking and I honestly think that the only reason you're not down at that hospital right now is that you're afraid.
I think one of the most universal human experiences is feeling alone. You'd never know it, but there's most likely tons of people feeling the exact same way.Maybe because you're feeling abandoned.Maybe because you realize that you aren't as self-sufficient as you thought.Maybe because you know you should've handled something differently.Or maybe because you aren't as good as you thought you were. Either way, when you hit that low point, you have a choice. You can either wallow in self-pity......Or you can suck it up. It's your call.	No. A patient is a stranger in a bed that you can distance yourself from whenever you need to. Ben is my friend and I'm going to try to get in there to visit him in the next couple of weeks but if I can't... that'll be very sad for me. But really... it will just mean that I'm human. Oh, and newbie? Please don't think that you have come here because Ben needs me. You're here because you're scared to death that you might have to rely on yourself for the first time ever and that... that is just the saddest thing of all.	Look, it boggles my mind that you just bail on a patient!	Geeeet out.	You gotta get back in the game, Coxie!Okay, Coxie was a mistake. Pretend I didn't say Coxie.
Uhhh....	What was that, Newbie?	You know, I never woulda slept with you if you'd told me you were Dr. Cox's ex-wife.	We could shower together for old time's sake.	I haven't even showered yet.
He likes Carla, anyway.	Relax. He doesn't know.	Uhhh....	What was that, Newbie?	You know, I never woulda slept with you if you'd told me you were Dr. Cox's ex-wife.
I heard that!	I got Carla wrapped around my finger.	He likes Carla, anyway.	Relax. He doesn't know.	Uhhh....
Nothing.	What are you guys talking about?	I heard that!	I got Carla wrapped around my finger.	He likes Carla, anyway.
Forget about it.	Thank you.	Nothing.	What are you guys talking about?	I heard that!
Why is he so uptight today?	Despite the fact that when you wake up tomorrow morning you will be a resident, you'll still be the same excitable little girl that you are right now; the only difference will be that some sorry new intern will probably mistake you for somebody who actually knows something.	Okay.	Come here!	Nuh-uh.
Oh, okay.	Hey, Perry.	Why is he so uptight today?	Despite the fact that when you wake up tomorrow morning you will be a resident, you'll still be the same excitable little girl that you are right now; the only difference will be that some sorry new intern will probably mistake you for somebody who actually knows something.	Okay.
Fine, loser gets Bober.	Okay, Rock-Paper-Scissors, right now.	Or nothing, I'm on break - let's do it.	Or?	Look, we can stand here and argue all day about who screwed who
Aw, just say it.	I've got a new shrink.	Are you dying?	Don't ever be afraid to come to me with stuff like that. The simple fact that you actually seem to give a crap is the reason I took an interest in you to begin with. It's why I trust you as a doctor. Hell, it's...it's why I trust you as a person.	W-well, th thank you!
Great! I'm off in, like, a half hour	That'd be terrific.	And I just wanna know...if I can buy you dinner.	Oh, no, no, no...no.	You know, Dr. Cox, I wanna thank you for this whole year
Would have been nice.	Oh, no. Here, I was led to believe that you were doing a gift certificate kind of thing. But, to sit and eat...with you, that's-that's just...that's crazy talk! I have half a mind to issue you a drug test. I mean, come on, what'd I sign up for	Great! I'm off in, like, a half hour	That'd be terrific.	And I just wanna know...if I can buy you dinner.
Ugh. I'm not!Ready to go?Morning, boy.	Could you be more homophobic?	Yeah, but with the head-to-foot alignment, it's just there's no way for them to lock in.	Dude, either way the naughty bits are still in the middle.	This is unacceptable. You said we were gonna sleep head-to-foot.
Rowdy, no.	I can't remember the last time I was in this foul a mood.	Ugh. I'm not!Ready to go?Morning, boy.	Could you be more homophobic?	Yeah, but with the head-to-foot alignment, it's just there's no way for them to lock in.
What?	I can't get to sleep / I think about the implications....	I'm cool. I'm cool.	Everything's gonna be fine. Okay? Just be cool.	I had my shoes on, it would have been impossible to lock in.
Uhhh....	I can't get to sleep / I think about the implications....Of diving in too deep / And possibly the complications....	Just keep it down.Shh!	Come back another day....	Oh, God!
Woo!	Dr. Dorian.	What the hell?	Good morning!	Steady now.... Be brave.... Don't cry.
Ooh! Is that my new nickname? 'Cause, you know, I actually thought people were gonna start calling me that in high school when I was in our production of 'The Wiz'....Yeah, it was the sort of the "hip" version of 'The Wizard of Oz'.... Nipsey Russell played the TinMan? "Come on and ease on down, ease on down the road!" Remember that? No? Well, anyway, you know, kids can be mean and everyone just started calling me "Dorothy." ...High school was hard....	Here you go, whiz-kid.	Woo!	Dr. Dorian.	What the hell?
Uh...yeah, sir, I have a full patient load; I don't understand that you just drop this guy in my lap and expect me to make him a top priority.	Oh, I'm sorry, sport; I was thinking about soup. Now, Mr. Zerbo was initially admitted with a high fever and suspected meningitis; but, both the NCT and the lumbar puncture came back negative.	Ooh! Is that my new nickname?

Neurology, rheumatology, hematology.... This guy's been turfed to every service in the hospital, no one knows what's wrong with him, what do you want me to do?	You want me to say "ta da!" so it seems more like a trick? Mr. Zerbo back there is a major hospital benefactor. And, by golly, you know it's a lot harder to write a big, fat check if you're dead.

'Kay, fine! You know.... After all, I'm I'm the Whiz Kid!	Well, gee, sport! I would say you should stop whining, find out what's wrong with him, and treat it; or you can be damn sure I'm going to give you something to whine about.	Dr. Kelso....	I hope it's navy bean today.	Neurology, rheumatology, hematology.... This guy's been turfed to every service in the hospital, no one knows what's wrong with him, what do you want me to do?
All negative.	Auto-immune serologies?	Who knows.... Maybe he just decided to let the whole ex-wife thing go.	Dr. Cox, I have this, uh, patient, Mr. Zerbo, I can't quite	I had planned to avoid Dr. Cox all day; but, unfortunately, I needed his help.
It was an accident.	I think I'll sit back down.	Okay, fine: I'm sorry I slept with your ex-wife!	Afraid you got yourself a toughie.	What kind of man tortures people like this!?!
A little scary Sorry! Jitters!	Look.... First of all, it's not like you tripped and fell into her...and then out of her...and then into her...again. And, second of all, you're smart enough to know that I don't want to talk about this; I don't want to know where you did it; I don't even want to know...how it was.	It was an accident.	I think I'll sit back down.	Okay, fine: I'm sorry I slept with your ex-wife!
Just hear me out: Our relationship ended so quickly, maybe too quickly, you know? And, now there's like these these feelings floating around, and I feel like we're always gonna regret it if we don't...see if they lead somewhere.What do you think?I can't believe how weird it feels to be back here again.	I'm sorry?	I think we should sex each other.	Now, she's in a really awkward place; so just be sensitive.	I have no idea how to treat this patient. Help me out.
If Carla's so mad, I don't understand why she doesn't just crash at her own place.	Yeah.... But it seems so right.	Just hear me out: Our relationship ended so quickly, maybe too quickly, you know? And, now there's like these these feelings floating around, and I feel like we're always gonna regret it if we don't...see if they lead somewhere.What do you think?I can't believe how weird it feels to be back here again.	I'm sorry?	I think we should sex each other.
What are you talking about, Willis?	Oh, she is back at her place.	If Carla's so mad, I don't understand why she doesn't just crash at her own place.	Yeah.... But it seems so right.	Just hear me out: Our relationship ended so quickly, maybe too quickly, you know? And, now there's like these these feelings floating around, and I feel like we're always gonna regret it if we don't...see if they lead somewhere.What do you think?I can't believe how weird it feels to be back here again.
Yeah, I know.	That's pretty funny!We should make that one of our things.	What are you talking about, Willis?	Oh, she is back at her place.	If Carla's so mad, I don't understand why she doesn't just crash at her own place.
Mm-mm.	This is the guy that screamed on you for like twenty minutes for dropping a thermometer? And he hasn't raised his voice once about you bumping uglies with his ex-wife?	No.	He hasn't yelled at you?	Yeah. You know what's weird, though? It's like, Dr. Cox and I are pretty vegan-kosher.
And that's when I realized something....	I don't get that guy.	Mm-mm.	This is the guy that screamed on you for like twenty minutes for dropping a thermometer? And he hasn't raised his voice once about you bumping uglies with his ex-wife?	No.
Uh...I must have misplaced my pager.	Hey, where you been? I paged you twice.	And that's when I realized something....	I don't get that guy.	Mm-mm.
You know, Elliot, I think we should talk about the sexual tension	Hey.	Hey.	Uncool!You look totally hot, Mirror Todd.	Do these help?
Awesome!	There is no sexual tension, okay!Just...go ahead and look before your neck snaps.	You know, Elliot, I think we should talk about the sexual tension	Hey.	Hey.
And the and the sexual tension.	J.D., the problem is this place. I mean, when we broke up, I had to see you the next day...and the next day. And we never...got any distance from the relationship. I never got...to move on, you know?	Awesome!	There is no sexual tension, okay!Just...go ahead and look before your neck snaps.	You know, Elliot, I think we should talk about the sexual tension
Rounds started five minutes ago, and I totally forgot about Mr. Zerbo! Oh, my God...Oh, my God...Oh, my God	The Hall	Oh, my God rounds!	I'm going out for Mexican food tonight. And I'll see you in bed, my friend.	Aren't you glad we did this?
Ow!	Are you plannin' on makin' this worth my while?	Rounds started five minutes ago, and I totally forgot about Mr. Zerbo! Oh, my God...Oh, my God...Oh, my God	The Hall	Oh, my God rounds!
Think, Whiz Kid, think!Ah, the hell with it.	Dr. Dorian? How 'bout you step up to the mic and tell the entire gang how you ended up treating Mr. Zerbo.	Ow!	Are you plannin' on makin' this worth my while?	Rounds started five minutes ago, and I totally forgot about Mr. Zerbo! Oh, my God...Oh, my God...Oh, my God
Oh, God. The ex-wife.	Hello, Perry.	Clear.	It's short for "Sandra".	You know, "Sandy" isn't necessarily a girls' name.
You know, it's J.D. Okay? And at least I remember the names of all my sexual partners.	Good job, D.J.	Ow!	Goodbye, Jordan. Sandy.	No worries.
It was Camp Meadow Wood. ...I made a lanyard.	Well, I'm sure that girl from high school and your bunk-mate from Camp Morning Wood are both extremely grateful. Yeah.	You know, it's J.D. Okay? And at least I remember the names of all my sexual partners.	Good job, D.J.	Ow!
Ted, I know, you told me last time that we	Hey. This is my band. We all work in different departments in the hospital.	Or the nurse who everyone agrees is just a little bit off.Or, if there's a full moon....	Hey, bro.	Unfortunately, I'm on-call tonight, and as weird as this place is during the day...it's even worse at night. See, that's when all the weirdos come out.Like the ER doctor who likes to work nights 'cause he says he's up anyway.
Never actually...done one of these unsupervised before.	Okay, Elliot: The ER doctor knows there's no attending up here, so instead of treating-&-streeting people, he's just admitting everyone. You've got twelve so far.Turk: Oncology, Cardiology, and Pediatrics all need surgical consults...plusThat phone is for you. It's the clinic they, too, know you're on your own so they're just patching all their night calls right on through.And Bambi: Room 201 needs an art-line, Room 202 needs reintubation; plus, Carol, you're needed in ICU to place a femoral swan under flu on Mr. Freed.	...And then the next moment, everything changes.	Oh, God. Come on.	It's amazing how one moment you think you know exactly what you want....
YES!	Oh. So you can do my stuff, but I can't do yours.	This this isn't like being a janitor, okay! It's not just like something everybody can do.	I owe ya. I'm helping you out.	What are you doing in here?
I don't know, the...rough side of a sponge?	Okay, hotshot, what would you use to get a coffee stain up off a tile floor?	YES!	Oh. So you can do my stuff, but I can't do yours.	This this isn't like being a janitor, okay! It's not just like something everybody can do.
But I...use those...for listening.	It's too late.	Okay, I want that, then.	You know you could have just asked me to stop hassling you for, like, a year?	Thank God.
His vitals are exactly the same. There's gotta be one attending in this stupid hospital.	Oh, uh, they want you upstairs in room, um, 208.	But I...use those...for listening.	It's too late.	Okay, I want that, then.
Sometimes, just making a decision is half the battle.	Surgery.	We all knew what we had to do.	Now I know you're all hoping Officer Berson's vitals will go up or down and this decision will be made for you, but guess what? Nothing's changed. So it's on you.	It's on my to-do list.
I-I gotta tell you, it's such an unusual case.... Would you mind if I try and get it published in a medical journal?	Wow. I can't wait to get my cast signed.	You broke your penis.	Great, and that means....?	You know, I have an interesting patient, too.So, basically, Mr. Davis, you received a blunt trauma to the fibrous tissue of the corpus cavernosum.
I'll let you...mull it over. And smile, Mr. Davis - tomorrow's gonna be a better day...for everyone.	That would be fantastic!	I-I gotta tell you, it's such an unusual case.... Would you mind if I try and get it published in a medical journal?	Wow. I can't wait to get my cast signed.	You broke your penis.
"Go aschmay."	Go away.	No, seriously, try me I can deal with anything.	Nothin'. Might just veg.	Well, why? What do you have to do?
Not about Reno.	Beg your pardon, Newbie? What are ya thinkin'?	I'm goin' to Reno! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!	What the hell. Go ahead and use me in your case report.	You see, ten minutes ago....
Okay.	She's talking to me, pumpkin.	Well, I've only been here a year, and he's actually just started calling me "The Kid" - which I love, by the way.	So, why haven't I heard your name before?	"The kid"? This is great.
You can't just change your mind!	She's not _my_ mother, dammit!Oh. And don't think that I've forgotten that you have yet to turn in a case report. You have until six.	Well, sir, I	You know, that's what my son always says. But then when Mother's Day rolls around, guess who wants me to go halvsies on a pasta pot for Enid?	Nothing, sir. I don't want anything from you, ever.
Crap.	Oh, I'm sorry. Did I pass out from the pain in my penis and suddenly we're not in America anymore?	You can't just change your mind!	She's not _my_ mother, dammit!Oh. And don't think that I've forgotten that you have yet to turn in a case report. You have until six.	Well, sir, I
Mrs. Warner, I was wondering if you'd give me permission to present your case to possibly be published in a national medical journal, so that I might be chosen to go to an AMA conference.	Come on - heel, toe - whatta you say, kid?	To marry me.	What?	Actually, if you could just give me a second, I want to ask Mrs. Warner something.
Thanks.Excuse me.	Sure. Why not.	Mrs. Warner, I was wondering if you'd give me permission to present your case to possibly be published in a national medical journal, so that I might be chosen to go to an AMA conference.	Come on - heel, toe - whatta you say, kid?	To marry me.
Glup.That's a good one.	No, that was you.	But you cried!	I like the old one.	Well what about your new mop?!
Maybe if you wore your hair up?	We're residents now, we should be treated more like colleagues, and I can't even get him to notice me.Oh, God! Oh! Uh! Sorry, sorry, sorry!	Clearly we're on the same page.	You know?	Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
Maybe I shouldn't bother.	Go ahead, I'm "mopping."	Let me explain, I	Yes, that's it. I'm a janitor, so I couldn't think of the word "sad." I was gonna say, It makes me feel so "mop."	Sad?
I guess after a while, you just stop being surprised by people.	Maybe you "mopn't."	Maybe I shouldn't bother.	Go ahead, I'm "mopping."	Let me explain, I
I know. I'm still gonna ask. So, how come I don't know anything about your family?	J.D., I was kidding.	That is adorable. Do you think he'd mind if I call him that, too?	That's my pet-name for Turk you know, 'cause he's mine and he's a black man: "My bruthah."	I didn't know you had a brother.
But you know everything about me. You even know I have them switch Lauren's shifts so we always end up working together.	I don't know. I g I'm just not big on sharing my personal life with people.	I know. I'm still gonna ask. So, how come I don't know anything about your family?	J.D., I was kidding.	That is adorable. Do you think he'd mind if I call him that, too?
He said "Holla."	I'll holla.	Catch you later, my bruthah!	Whatever. I'm out.	Not entirely unlike a...ninja!
Wow.	Fine!I don't like the way I look. I don't like the way I think. I don't like the way I feel about how I look. ...I have too much hair, my boobs are too low, my butt is too big, and I'm so short!Plus, when I work up this morning, I cried for like half an hour because I thought I was getting wrinkles, but it turns out I just fell asleep on Turk's corduroy pants!	I think I can handle it.	Okay. You want in? You want me to open up?	Rough day, huh? Well, maybe it would help to share...with someone?
Carla! Trust me, there's no way that he's cheating on you.	Please, they might as well be naked. Slut.	He's not! That's his "In your face" dance.... Or it's his "There's a sale on lotion" dance. I dunno; he's got so many dances.	Then why is he doing his "You're so getting a piece of this" dance?	What, Turk and Bonnie? They hate each other.
Wait, that's it? You were just freakin' out.	Yeah, you're probably right.	Carla! Trust me, there's no way that he's cheating on you.	Please, they might as well be naked. Slut.	He's not! That's his "In your face" dance.... Or it's his "There's a sale on lotion" dance. I dunno; he's got so many dances.
Crazy!	Hey, you wanted in!	Wait, that's it? You were just freakin' out.	Yeah, you're probably right.	Carla! Trust me, there's no way that he's cheating on you.
Okay, never. But we both know that if you ever did, I would give you a break. Now let's see how you like it when I walk away from you.Actually, I need to go this way.Right the first time.	When have I ever screwed up with you?	Quiet; this isn't about you! Don't eat meat!Carla! Look, every time you screwed up with me, I've totally let you off the hook.	Thanks, man.	Will you lay off Mr. Hogan? So he made a mistake, all right, people make mistakes. When they do, it wouldn't hurt you to cut them some slack once in a while.
And if you're lucky, when it really matters, you'll pass with flying colors.	Mm-hmm. He's having some problems.	Really?	I spoke to my brother today.	I think every day is made up of tiny little tests.Some are tests of character.Some are tests of fortitude.Others are tests of friendship.
I'm watching you.That's right, Sasquatch.	The...janitor branch.	Which branch?	Yes, I was.	You were never in the military.
T. Diddy?	Okay, it's a tie.	I ain't hearin' that, woman, 'cause I'm talkin' to him.	Oh, come on, J.D.'s white!	Yeah, you are.
I would watch that show.	That'd be true if Starsky was a ventriloquist and Hutch was a tiny puppet.	You know, you guys are getting to be like Starsky and Hutch.	I don't know, dude.	Domo arigato, Dr. Amato.How is that not funny?
Why do you keep ending up with that guy?	Yeah.	I would watch that show.	That'd be true if Starsky was a ventriloquist and Hutch was a tiny puppet.	You know, you guys are getting to be like Starsky and Hutch.
Oh, what, ending up with Dr. Amato is like a punishment or something?	Because the other surgeons are busting my chops for skipping guys' night out.	Why do you keep ending up with that guy?	Yeah.	I would watch that show.
Check that out.	No, dude; I actually enjoy needing you to lower me on the toilet in the morning.	Oh, what, ending up with Dr. Amato is like a punishment or something?	Because the other surgeons are busting my chops for skipping guys' night out.	Why do you keep ending up with that guy?
Mmm?	I know it looks innocent, but Elliot was late this morning. Plus, once you've been here a while, you learn to read between the lines.	Check that out.	No, dude; I actually enjoy needing you to lower me on the toilet in the morning.	Oh, what, ending up with Dr. Amato is like a punishment or something?
You know what I mean!	What, you mean after Labor Day? Eh.	You can't wear that!	How's it goin'?	I love it that Mr. Blair trusted me. It's one of the best feelings you can have as a doctor.
Jerk!	It's a white coat. Anybody can wear a white coat.	You know what I mean!	What, you mean after Labor Day? Eh.	You can't wear that!
Just when you think you have this place figured out, it finds a new way to get you.	You mean "permanent."	'Course it's temporary. It could also be slightly more un-temporary.	This is only temporary, right?	Whoa; nobody needs to go call Dr. Cox.
My bad.	MAYBE _YOU_ SHOULD CALM DOWN!	Ted, I don't I don't have the nose. Maybe you should just calm down.	Kelso's gonna blame me. Just...get rid of the nose!	No, I-I just gave him I.V. Imipenem.
Great. Thank you, Ted.	Imipenem...Imipenem...Imipenem...."Unlike Gentamicin and Tetracycline, Imipenem has never been associated with anosmia." My God, we're okay. We're okay.	My bad.	MAYBE _YOU_ SHOULD CALM DOWN!	Ted, I don't I don't have the nose. Maybe you should just calm down.
What?	It's...my birthday.	Great. Thank you, Ted.	Imipenem...Imipenem...Imipenem...."Unlike Gentamicin and Tetracycline, Imipenem has never been associated with anosmia." My God, we're okay. We're okay.	My bad.
"Woof"?	Gosh, I'm so proud of ya. Put her there.Woof.	kinda.	Here you've put me in a tough situation: I can't honestly decide whether to say, "Duh," uh, "Doy," or a very sarcastic, "Oh, really?" My God, Fiona, I know it wasn't your fault; hell, the patient probably knows! But he seemed a little distraught, like maybe being able to blame somebody for a second or two just might make him feel a little better? And, I know, maybe it's me, but doesn't that seem like something that goes right along with wearing that fancy white coat? It...does, doesn't it.	Anosmia isn't a side-effect of I.V. Imipenem. Plus, Mr. Blair had multiple nasal polypectomies, and septoplasty; and his loss of smell is most likely caused by repeated manipulation of the sinuses along with concurrent infection. So, I didn't make a mistake; and you were wrong when you said, "Nice goin', Newbie."
Laverne! Careful.	Come on, baby. Let's see if we can find you a ride.	Good luck.	It's all right.	Oh, Mr. Blair, I just wanted to say again that I made a mistake, and I'm sorry.
Well, you know, maybe tomorrow, I'll get a bad hair-cut and push around a mop all day!I know you don't have to do it, okay?Yeah.	Oh, so we're done with the coats?? All right. Well, it was a fun day, though, wasn't it? See you tomorrow.	Laverne! Careful.	Come on, baby. Let's see if we can find you a ride.	Good luck.
Dr. Cox, this is my big brother, Dan! He just showed up unexpected!	You know, it's funny, Vivian, I was just going to ask you the exact same question, seeing as how I paged you four minutes and thirty-eight seconds ago.	What the hell are you doing here!?	Arrgghh! Hey-hey-hey, little brother! It's the head-lockin' Dan!	It was sad, 'cause I started to think I'd never feel like a kid again.
Because I need special time with my brother! Argh!	Heh, yeah right. Now, I'll give you three seconds to give me the real reason I can't go to lunch, otherwise I'm coming.Three...two...one.	Ohh, I'm not gonna mess with that hostess. You know, she uses sharp tones.	So call and change it to three.	Yeah, I...well, you know, I would've invited you, but I already made the reservation for two.
Excuse me?	Trick.	Because I need special time with my brother! Argh!	Heh, yeah right. Now, I'll give you three seconds to give me the real reason I can't go to lunch, otherwise I'm coming.Three...two...one.	Ohh, I'm not gonna mess with that hostess. You know, she uses sharp tones.
Whatever.	I just figure you gotta be wondering, "Am I gonna get a trick, or am I gonna get a treat?" You'll be getting a trick.	Excuse me?	Trick.	Because I need special time with my brother! Argh!
You just told me it was gonna be you.	It'll be fast, and you won't even know it's me.	Whatever.	I just figure you gotta be wondering, "Am I gonna get a trick, or am I gonna get a treat?" You'll be getting a trick.	Excuse me?
False alarm, boys.	You'll still have your doubts.And the best part is, you're gonna be nervous all day about it, 'cause it could happen at any time!That wasn't it. Fun, though!	You just told me it was gonna be you.	It'll be fast, and you won't even know it's me.	Whatever.
Oh, God! It's everywhere!	There's your heated seat, my friend.	No...why?Oh, God! Oh, please tell me that......that was the horn!	So, can you work the windows from back there?	Somehow I knew my brother would handle this the way he always did when there was a deep emotional conflict between us.
I didn't ask you to do that!	Because you asked me to. Here you go.	Well, then, why'd you knock the folder out of my hand?!	No, it's not me.	A gorilla....
Sir, I don't follow.	Dr. Dorian, if I had one shred of evidence that incident actually took place, you would be working with my nephew Francis so fast, it'd make your head spin!	Dr. Kelso, I	I don't have time to stand here and flirt, son. There have been rumblings that you let your brother play doctor the other day.	Oh, good, sir.
Not _inside_, no.	He cleans pools! I forgot you didn't know that! Well, anyway, I trust we will not be seeing your brother in the hospital again!	Sir, I don't follow.	Dr. Dorian, if I had one shred of evidence that incident actually took place, you would be working with my nephew Francis so fast, it'd make your head spin!	Dr. Kelso, I
Oh, yeah....	I don't know.... Maybe the fact that you're so embarrassed by me that you make excuses to your friends about how I live my life.	Elliot! Come on! What does she expect us to talk about?	'Kay, you know what, forget it.	Yeah! Those were awesome!
You see, it's the kid inside of us that keeps us all from going crazy.	...a cashew!	I'd let her to blow my house down, you know what I'm sayin'!	Dude, that girl in the wolf outfit is totally checking you out!	Right then, I knew I'd never see my brother the same way again.You can never let go of the kid inside of you.
I had...four different helmets.	Who's ready for some frisbee!Get my mom! Get my mom!	Oh, please. I lived for danger.	Oh, gosh, Martha, I'd love to attend your safety camp this summer I would but here my parents are making me go to Maine with them. So whatta you say you make sure and take a lot of pictures, that way, when you get back, we can both sit down and put together a "Friends Forever" collage. Come on, now, the kid's sixteen years old he's a little busted up, it's not that big a deal. I mean, hell, when...when you were a kid, you must've cut your hand on your doll house?	Okay; okay, Mike, that's all that matters.Victor.... Ohhhhh....Victoria!I mean, the kid thinks he's Evil Knievel
I usually don't walk away from Dr. Cox, but today's the day the pharmaceutical reps show up to peddle their new drugs. And, at Sacred Heart, that means one thing: Julie's here.	Lookit, I don't have time right now to be the hundred-watt bulb for your annoying little moth, so if you could just fly away, that'd be great. Just fly awa hey....?	I had...four different helmets.	Who's ready for some frisbee!Get my mom! Get my mom!	Oh, please. I lived for danger.
What just happened!?!	"Back to work..." Message received.	I gotta get back to work.	No, no, no; I think you're right. From now on, before I do anything, I'll make sure to run it by you first. Permission to go see my kid's attempt to overcome his crippling shyness by appearing in his fourth grade class's production of "Town Without A Turkey"?	No. N-n-no no catchies.
This is a crucial moment. Pick your words carefully.	This just sucks.... You know?	There are a lot of things that can take you by surprise.Sometimes, it's just realizing that you're not as happy as you thought.Sometimes, it's a hot chick smacking her tushie.And sometimes, it's when you take a chance...and lose.	Mrs. Kahn died on the operating table.	Buy a cup!Hey. What's wrong?
Whattos to who?	...I say, kudos to Dr. Reid.	And here comes the crushing blow!	I believe we all have a lesson to learn from Dr. Reid's case....	He's like a royal python torturing a hopper mouse. ...Man, I love Animal Planet.
Where are we going? I don't I don't want to go anywhere. I want to spend time with Snaggletooth!	Come on!	What?	Come here!	The point is, Kelso's right; you know? It's not even just professionally in my personal life, I don't take any chances, either. I want to, I just...I can never seem to take that first step.
I guess it all comes down to what we're willing to risk.For some of us, it's our feelings....	Nooo.	Where are we going? I don't I don't want to go anywhere. I want to spend time with Snaggletooth!	Come on!	What?
We could die!	Come on, what's the worst that could happen?	I don't wanna do it.	Dude, you're gonna love this!	For me, it was taking a risk, period. Even if that meant starting with my very first step.
Can't we just go back and talk to Snaggletooth?!	Okay, the second worst?	We could die!	Come on, what's the worst that could happen?	I don't wanna do it.
Obstetrics and Gynecology is a specialty that's usually dominated by women.	Hey, guys. Gyno Girls, twelve o'clock.	I'm just saying, if I had to get three by lunch, I probably could.	You really pick odd things to brag about.	Twice this morning, and I haven't even had my coffee yet.
Being a Gyno Girl is a lot like being in a sorority.	Dr. Reid? I'm Dr. Gerson. We were just wondering if you have any thoughts about your specialty? Because we really think you're OB-GYN material.	Obstetrics and Gynecology is a specialty that's usually dominated by women.	Hey, guys. Gyno Girls, twelve o'clock.	I'm just saying, if I had to get three by lunch, I probably could.
Ah, just gimme a second, I'm figuring something out for a patient.	J.D.! I can't go with Dr. Gerson because I have to help you...right?	Being a Gyno Girl is a lot like being in a sorority.	Dr. Reid? I'm Dr. Gerson. We were just wondering if you have any thoughts about your specialty? Because we really think you're OB-GYN material.	Obstetrics and Gynecology is a specialty that's usually dominated by women.
Dammit!	I'm glad we all finally experimented with each other...but I'll never do it again.	Ah, just gimme a second, I'm figuring something out for a patient.	J.D.! I can't go with Dr. Gerson because I have to help you...right?	Being a Gyno Girl is a lot like being in a sorority.
Really?	Yep. In fact, right now, I'm dusting for fingerprints.	Oh? Well, that's good.	You know, we're zeroing in on the guy that's been stealing stuff.	Luckily for Turk, revenge is a dish best served cold.... Not unlike this tapioca pudding.
Where're you going? Munchies?	What!? That that's not even true! You're a jackass!	Then maybe it's because I told her that you smoke the ganja.	Yeah, "Marcia Gets Creamed" Season Five, Episode Three. Don't _ever_ question me on The Bunch. Besides, there's no way they liked you better than me.	You know, when Marcia was working at the ice cream shop, and then she got Jan a job, and they liked Jan better, so they fired Marcia.
You stole my money!	"Bab " You stole my job!	Oh, quit being such a baby.	I'm not talking to you. ....And, yes.	That is so cool! Did they let you run the siren?
Oh, yeah? Well find this!	That was a _finder's fee_!	You stole my money!	"Bab " You stole my job!	Oh, quit being such a baby.
Wouldn't that hurt?	You know, you're supposed to grab your crotch when you say that.	Oh, yeah? Well find this!	That was a _finder's fee_!	You stole my money!
Can I run the siren?	Yeah, I know.	Carla. She said "we" "We need to scrape some money together." And it wasn't just like a "we're dating" we; it was just like a "we're gonna spend the rest of our lives together" we. I don't know, man, that that just seems big to me, you know?	What?	She said "we."
Uhhhh, actually, Dr. Cox, I was watching TV last night, and they had this special on flesh-eating bacteria....	I guarantee you, that's a simple case of cellulitis right there.	...they were going pretty well for me.	Oh, God, that's good.	As bad as things were going for Elliot...
Yeah, I think they called it "flesh-eating bacteria" to sound more flashy — you know, hook in all the idiots.	Necrotizing fasciitis; yeeeesss?	Uhhhh, actually, Dr. Cox, I was watching TV last night, and they had this special on flesh-eating bacteria....	I guarantee you, that's a simple case of cellulitis right there.	...they were going pretty well for me.
Anyhoo, point being, uh, they said it was very easy to confuse, uh, cellulitis with chompers...."Chompers" was the — the animated flesh-eating bacteria that — that narrated the special.	Apparently it worked.	Yeah, I think they called it "flesh-eating bacteria" to sound more flashy — you know, hook in all the idiots.	Necrotizing fasciitis; yeeeesss?	Uhhhh, actually, Dr. Cox, I was watching TV last night, and they had this special on flesh-eating bacteria....
Come on, trust yourself.	Look, Britney, recently I made the potentially fatal mistake of getting back together with my ex-wife, who, angel that she is, is carrying the spawn of another man's seed. So forgive me if I sound a tad irritable when I tell you, I don't care what piece of irrelevant drivel you picked off TV while you were snuggled up in your Holly Hobbie P.J.s.	Anyhoo, point being, uh, they said it was very easy to confuse, uh, cellulitis with chompers...."Chompers" was the — the animated flesh-eating bacteria that — that narrated the special.

No, top three. Top three.	Here, you take it.Haw-haw! Magic!	Do you want it?	Cool, a coin.	Well, definitely top two.What's that I see in your ear...? Pa-ZOW!
Ah! Sure. "To my two biggest fans."	Doctor. Could you sign these, please?	Grr!	There's Mr. Flesh-Eating Bacteria!	You!
I — I know... I'm a doctor.	Yeah. They're called breasts.	Ah! Sure. "To my two biggest fans."	Doctor. Could you sign these, please?	Grr!
First of all, in your face, because it was Friday night; and secondly, I woulda made the catch regardless — you see, if you use your head and do some homework, medicine is just... it's basically science!	You know, Eunice, you never even woulda made that catch if you weren't such an all-purpose nerd, sitting home alone on a Saturday night, watching some medical special on TV!	I — I know... I'm a doctor.	Yeah. They're called breasts.	Ah! Sure. "To my two biggest fans."
Great.	See, this is a bicycle bell. Now, you hold on to this, because I'm gonna give you a different part every year. Maybe after the party, we can take it out for a spin!	Look, Elliot, my dad's an office supplies salesman. A bad one. So things were a little different for me, growing up.	Well, I may have told her that she spends more money dying her roots than I do on groceries. Still, this whole thing is just as much her fault as it is my father's — neither one of them prepared me for this.	Just like that?
Still waiting on that kick-stand.	'Kay?	Great.	See, this is a bicycle bell. Now, you hold on to this, because I'm gonna give you a different part every year. Maybe after the party, we can take it out for a spin!	Look, Elliot, my dad's an office supplies salesman. A bad one. So things were a little different for me, growing up.
Please. I know all there is to know about thrombotic... thrombo... cyto — cytop-top-top-top... toppee— toppee—	All right, fair enough, here's your chance — two identical patients. I say we divide 'em up, just like in The Parent Trap. One goes with the sexy, free-wheeling, bachelor dad — hello. The other goes with the whiny, neurotic, sexually repressed mom — oh, just you all over.Oh, and I checked tonight's TV listings — there is no special on that disease, so you're gonna want to stop at the Blockbuster.	Well, believe what you want to believe. I'll do it again.	Look who peeked in his shorts and found a pair! What are you, feeling like you finally took on the old man in a game of one-on-one and kicked his ass? Well, here's the news-flash, there, Skeetch: It was a fluke!	Oh, are you too busy eating sour grapes?
Why do you always have to be like that? You know that I try harder than anyone in this place, and you never give me any credit!	What, now that you've decided you're ready to listen, how does it work, huh? You gonna pull a string on my back? Well, step right up and give it a tug. But, I'm warning you, I bet it keeps coming up "Go to hell, Shakira."	What?!	How about, "Go to hell, Shakira."	Sure! Hit me.
Thanks for your help.	Now, you listen to me, Newbie. I'm not doing this because I get my jollies off of being your mentor, and I'm damn sure not doing it so that years from now I can say, "Boy, I knew him when." I'm doing it because if I don't, people would die.	Why do you always have to be like that? You know that I try harder than anyone in this place, and you never give me any credit!

But, I'm warning you, I bet it keeps coming up "Go to hell, Shakira."	What?!
Thanks.	The thing that you forgot? Turns out, whatever you know about medicine, ultimately, luck or fate or God or... who knows what is always gonna end up playing a much bigger role in the whole thing than you and I ever will. Hell, it was lucky you were watching that show the other night. And it was unlucky that your patient went the other way, even though you did absolutely everything right; and, for the record, you did. I was looking over your shoulder every step of the way.	What?	It was luck.	As I sat there, still searching for answers about my patient, I realized that I still needed Dr. Cox. It's hard to face a harsh truth about yourself.I guess the only thing you can do is try to take positive steps.Unfortunately, it's hard to take positive steps when you've burned the bridge you need to walk across.
Okay! So I'm in a bit of a dry spell.... I have no idea what to do with myself.	We're talking about you right now, studly.	Mission accomplished.	Baby, it was dark, and he/she had a body that was rockin'!	Once, on a red-eye flight, Turk groped a trans-sexual.
Please! I'm a young, single player with a heart of gold. I should be able to stir something up.How _do_ you get so dirty?...Rowdy!	Why don't you give Rowdy a bath he smells a little ripe.	Okay! So I'm in a bit of a dry spell.... I have no idea what to do with myself.	We're talking about you right now, studly.	Mission accomplished.
Okay, momentary set-back. Regroup. Regroup!	No, I get asked out all the time.	Free gum No! You know, I was just thinking, you're probably one of those girls that's so pretty that no one ever has the courage to ask you out.	J.D., I can't give you free gum.	Hey, Lisa! How you doin'?
Who the hell cares.	How _does_ he get so dirty?	Ohh, I could think of a couple things....	So...what did you have in mind?	Very funny, you dumb choir punks! Santa's a drunk! Where were we?
"A.Q." is sort of a new, hip expression means "Any questions?"	What!?	Yeah, I'm trying it out. I find, with the ladies, if you're clear with your intentions right off the bat, they just fall in to place. A.Q.?	"Perry"?	You know, Perry
No, I feel pretty good about it. You want me.	Come on, you can't be sure.	Oh, come on, I am so in.	So you think you're in, huh?	That little guy earned his money tonight.
Uh, yeah, I'm a doctor; all the symptoms are there you do.	I don't!	No, I feel pretty good about it. You want me.	Come on, you can't be sure.	Oh, come on, I am so in.
Whoa. Heh. Uh.... You know, I thought I had to sneeze, but it was a false alarm. Let's do this.	Just kiss me.	Uh, yeah, I'm a doctor; all the symptoms are there you do.	I don't!	No, I feel pretty good about it. You want me.
You know what it is? It's like a tickling. I got this, like this, like weird, like...it's a flutter. Erp!	Okay.	Whoa. Heh. Uh.... You know, I thought I had to sneeze, but it was a false alarm. Let's do this.	Just kiss me.	Uh, yeah, I'm a doctor; all the symptoms are there you do.
Yeah?	Nappy?	You know what it is? It's like a tickling. I got this, like this, like weird, like...it's a flutter. Erp!	Okay.	Whoa. Heh. Uh.... You know, I thought I had to sneeze, but it was a false alarm. Let's do this.
I guess you never know how the monster's gonna attack.	I want you to stop fooling around, and Give me a kiss.	Yeah?	Nappy?	You know what it is? It's like a tickling. I got this, like this, like weird, like...it's a flutter. Erp!
Sometimes it pulls you away at the absolute worst time.	All right, we need to talk about this.	I guess you never know how the monster's gonna attack.	I want you to stop fooling around, and Give me a kiss.	Yeah?
Sometimes it even takes the roof over your head.And sometimes, the monster takes something you never thought you could lose.......Like your mojo.	Babe, I'm sorry.	Sometimes it pulls you away at the absolute worst time.	All right, we need to talk about this.	I guess you never know how the monster's gonna attack.
Actually, it's a roll of quarters. It's uh...laundry day! Heh.	Is that a roll of quarters in your pocket or are you just having a really good time?	Sometimes it even takes the roof over your head.And sometimes, the monster takes something you never thought you could lose.......Like your mojo.	Babe, I'm sorry.	Sometimes it pulls you away at the absolute worst time.
See ya.	Oh.	Actually, it's a roll of quarters. It's uh...laundry day! Heh.	Is that a roll of quarters in your pocket or are you just having a really good time?	Sometimes it even takes the roof over your head.And sometimes, the monster takes something you never thought you could lose.......Like your mojo.
Okay, you're freaking out! Just keep your head down, and move.	Hey, Goldman! How's your penis?	All right, calm down, he says that to everyone.	Hey, J.D.! How's your penis?	What, did someone send out a flier?!
No.	Hm? Oh, I get it! I haven't paid you back, so you won't even look at me?	Okay, you're freaking out! Just keep your head down, and move.	Hey, Goldman! How's your penis?	All right, calm down, he says that to everyone.
See what you did!	It's been one day, you greedy little bastard!	No.	Hm? Oh, I get it! I haven't paid you back, so you won't even look at me?	Okay, you're freaking out! Just keep your head down, and move.
Luckily for me, I had a friend I could talk to about anything.	Dr. Reid, your truck is double-parked.	See what you did!	It's been one day, you greedy little bastard!	No.
As for me, I just have to hope that my problem will eventually work itself out.	You too.	Don't sweat it. Well, have a good night.	Um...thanks again, J.D.	And sometimes that means letting a friend help you out.
It was exactly what I wanted.	Merry Christmas.	As for me, I just have to hope that my problem will eventually work itself out.	You too.	Don't sweat it. Well, have a good night.
Mistake or not, one cool thing about sex is, it always seems to put you in a good mood.Hell, I think it even cheers up the people around you.	Dr. Dorian.	I don't know...but she seems to _love_ it!The Congo. But look, Elliot, I think I think you're right last night was great, but w-we can't keep doing this.Dr. Reid.	Why does that one monkey keep biting the other one on the ass?	Animal Planet.
Oh, come on, we could we could rent a movie...got a fresh pack of Uno cards....You know what we could do? We could have sex again I'm throwing it out there.	I don't feel like doing anything.	What to do? What to do...what to do, what to do, what to do?	Me too.	Ugh! What a day! Whoo-ee! I am as stressed out and vulnerable as I was last night.
Oh, come on! I'm sorry, I was kidding! I'm just it's just a joke!	Bite me.	Oh, come on, we could we could rent a movie...got a fresh pack of Uno cards....You know what we could do? We could have sex again I'm throwing it out there.	I don't feel like doing anything.	What to do? What to do...what to do, what to do, what to do?
Stay calm.	No, I mean it like you did last night.... Come bite me.	Oh, come on! I'm sorry, I was kidding! I'm just it's just a joke!	Bite me.	Oh, come on, we could we could rent a movie...got a fresh pack of Uno cards....You know what we could do? We could have sex again I'm throwing it out there.
Can't!	Can't...or won't?	No, no, I'm I'm not kidding. I...can't.	Oh, right. Tell me.	Oh, I...can't tell you, it's, you know, doctor-patient confidentiality.
Where's the wiggle room in that? There's no wiggle!Fine. Let me just tell him with you so I can enjoy it, too.	Oh, come on! Can't we just tell him that he can go?	He's had a nasty case of pneumonia. Let's see. Well, his leukocytosis is resolved, and his blood cultures are negative.... Tell him we'll do the best we can.	You know, Mr. Woodbury's son is getting married this weekend; he keeps asking me if he's gonna be able to go.	Later, dude.
Look, if it ever got that emotional, I'd break it off.	Okay.I don't wanna get all Dr. Phil on you, but the last time I checked, women have a hard time separating sex from emotions. So, you may think you're just tappin' that right now, but pretty soon she's gonna be like, "J.D., I need you."	Fo' shizzle.	What are you guys, just sex buddies or something?	Oh, relax, man. We're just having fun.
You are good!	Okay. Oh, by the way, dude right there is totally hitting that dude! He's totally hitting him!	Look, if it ever got that emotional, I'd break it off.	Okay.I don't wanna get all Dr. Phil on you, but the last time I checked, women have a hard time separating sex from emotions. So, you may think you're just tappin' that right now, but pretty soon she's gonna be like, "J.D., I need you."	Fo' shizzle.
I'm so glad Esteban found someone!	I know.	You are good!	Okay. Oh, by the way, dude right there is totally hitting that dude! He's totally hitting him!	Look, if it ever got that emotional, I'd break it off.
She needs you? Oh, my God, Turk was right. You have to stop kissing her, and put an end to this before she gets hurt!	J.D., I had such a crappy day. I really need you right now. Come here.	Oh. Okay.	Sitting in the dark...crying. So, you know, the usual.	Elliot? What are you doing?
Eh, she's a tough kid you can tell her later.	Is there something wrong?	She needs you? Oh, my God, Turk was right. You have to stop kissing her, and put an end to this before she gets hurt!	J.D., I had such a crappy day. I really need you right now. Come here.	Oh. Okay.
Hello? ... Oh, hi, Mom! ... Yeah! I miss you, too! I haven't spoken to you in so long.Hi, Mr. Turk. ... No, Chris isn't here. ... No! No, sir, I didn't say "Mom," I said..."mon," like, "Hey, mon, we be jammin'!" ... N-no, sir, I don't think all black people are Jamaican.I I love you too, Mommy!Sir, could you call back later? Chris will be home.	This is not the time to talk it out. So you just need to get out of the situation without making her suspicious.	Mmmmm.	God, this can't be happening! I'm a doctor! What the hell use is being a doctor if nobody lets you treat them? What is going on with my life?	No!
And hopefully you'll be respected for it.	Unfortunately, we're not comfortable discharging you just yet. I'm really, really sorry.	Hopefully, you see yourself in time to make a change.	Mr. Woodbury! Hold on a sec!	It's a funny thing when we're forced to see ourselves in a new light.
Uh.... It's it's no big deal. You you get your stuff out of my room, and you crash on the couch.	So, what do we do?	Me neither.	No, this. You know sex buddies.J.D., Dr. Cox and I were talking, and my life is just so scattered right now. And I just...I just can't seem to grab a toe-hold, you know? And...I know myself, and if we keep doing this, I'm not gonna be able to separate the sex from my feelings. And we'll just end up being a couple again. And...neither one of us wants that, right?I mean, I know I don't.	Okay, less tongue, less tongue.
All right, just relax. You can totally handle this.	I'll just go get dressed...and then, uh, we can go to work.	Morning, pal.	Oh...right. Morning, buddy!	Ultimately, life is a lot simpler at home.Unless you live with a co-worker you're crazy about, and she recently decided she can't handle sleeping with you, and she just wants to be friends.
Ooh!Yes?	Hey, J.D.	You were right. I'll just...put this guy's side-view mirror on his roof.Argh.	Told you I could fit in this spot!	Chop Chop-chop, buddy!
G'head.	I wanted to say something, you know, before we go back in there.	Ooh!Yes?	Hey, J.D.	You were right. I'll just...put this guy's side-view mirror on his roof.Argh.
Why?	That I understand that it's gonna be a little bit harder for you to transition into being just friends again.	G'head.	I wanted to say something, you know, before we go back in there.	Ooh!Yes?
What does that have to do with anything?	Because...you're a guy?	Why?	That I understand that it's gonna be a little bit harder for you to transition into being just friends again.	G'head.
I know.Oh, yeah...this is how you like it.	You're right. You know what we should do? Everything I own is in the back of this truck including my bed. We should just get in there, get naked, and have sex one last time just get it out of our system.J.D., I was kidding to prove a point.	What does that have to do with anything?	Because...you're a guy?	Why?
Good.	Cool.	Maybe I will!	You should.	Well, maybe I'll just ask Lisa out again.
That's what I'll do.	Take it home.	Good.	Cool.	Maybe I will!
Great! ...You know, but there's no rush for you to move out.	Hey, I found an apartment!	So, anyway, Elliot....	What the hell? Did you just throw something out into the hall?	Hey, Todd.
That would be stupid.	Well, what are we gonna do, just live with each other forever, and anytime we feel, like, lonely or vulnerable, we just hop into bed and have hot sex?	Great! ...You know, but there's no rush for you to move out.	Hey, I found an apartment!	So, anyway, Elliot....
I know.	We're both human, so, staying in that situation would be a big mistake.	That would be stupid.	Well, what are we gonna do, just live with each other forever, and anytime we feel, like, lonely or vulnerable, we just hop into bed and have hot sex?	Great! ...You know, but there's no rush for you to move out.
Look!	How did you mean it?	I I didn't mean it that way, I just....	What do you think, there aren't kids out there that want to grow up to make the world sparkle?	About...being a janitor?
I don't know.... Maybe it's 'cause they're proud...maybe it's 'cause they're scared....	Well, I don't get why people have to do that.	Okay, maybe you're right. But, we're doctors, man. I mean, that comes with the territory; some patients just don't like telling the whole truth.	Well, if the cut was that deep, I'd probably just, uh, pull your arm off.Once again: _Doctor_..._Jan_ _Itor_. Dr. Jan Itor.	It is not.
Maybe it's because telling the truth would make them feel too vulnerable.	You know what, it was just stuff! I'm fine.	I don't know.... Maybe it's 'cause they're proud...maybe it's 'cause they're scared....	Well, I don't get why people have to do that.	Okay, maybe you're right. But, we're doctors, man. I mean, that comes with the territory; some patients just don't like telling the whole truth.
Oh, my God!	I guess. Dude, you're gonna be late for Gift Shop Girl.	Maybe it's because telling the truth would make them feel too vulnerable.	You know what, it was just stuff! I'm fine.	I don't know.... Maybe it's 'cause they're proud...maybe it's 'cause they're scared....
You might as well put it in her cham-lame glass.	Tonight I'm gonna make her a nice dinner, then I'm gonna put the ring in her champagne glass.	Congratulations! So, when are you gonna ask her?	Positive.	Okay, ready?You sure?
Okay, first you gotta get, like, fifty candles, right?	Okay, Mr. Know-It-All, what would you do?	You might as well put it in her cham-lame glass.	Tonight I'm gonna make her a nice dinner, then I'm gonna put the ring in her champagne glass.	Congratulations! So, when are you gonna ask her?
You spread 'em all over the room with some rose petals....	Mm-hmm?	Okay, first you gotta get, like, fifty candles, right?	Okay, Mr. Know-It-All, what would you do?	You might as well put it in her cham-lame glass.
Like a meadow in springtime.	That's right, because the roses are beautiful, and they make the room smell amazing.	You spread 'em all over the room with some rose petals....	Mm-hmm?	Okay, first you gotta get, like, fifty candles, right?
I honestly believe, in hospitals...there's like this...balance. You know? It's like, when one person dies, another person gets a chance to live. I like to call it The Circle of Life.	Ugh. You know, it always feels so weird to be sitting around hoping someone's family pulls them off life support.	You are naughty!	If I finally get a damn heart, I'll let you eat ice cream off it!	Hey, homeslice, we talked about this you don't get into bed until I come here so I can see your bootay.
I like that baby lion cub. What's his name...?	Oh, my God! You must stop watching 'The Lion king'!	I honestly believe, in hospitals...there's like this...balance. You know? It's like, when one person dies, another person gets a chance to live. I like to call it The Circle of Life.	Ugh. You know, it always feels so weird to be sitting around hoping someone's family pulls them off life support.	You are naughty!
Trick question! You like it, too!	..."Simba"...?	I like that baby lion cub. What's his name...?	Oh, my God! You must stop watching 'The Lion king'!	I honestly believe, in hospitals...there's like this...balance. You know? It's like, when one person dies, another person gets a chance to live. I like to call it The Circle of Life.
I'd say she's pregnant.	Oh, you girls! Excuse me, Elaine, I actually need his opinion on something.	Trick question! You like it, too!	..."Simba"...?	I like that baby lion cub. What's his name...?
It's kinda flattering that you'd choose me.	Just a terrific catch, there, Newbie. Listen to her heart, will ya? I heard mitral stenosis and I need an extra set of ears, let's go.	I'd say she's pregnant.	Oh, you girls! Excuse me, Elaine, I actually need his opinion on something.	Trick question! You like it, too!
You see, as a doctor, you get used to the whole balance in the hospital thing. You know, when one person lives, another dies, and how it always seems to even out...	We don't deliver this baby, your wife could die.	But, ultimately, you have to grit your teeth and just say it.	No reason.	Sometimes, the words don't come out at all.
Okay, this is a little cozy for me.	Yeah! I know that.	Well, you know that I would never mean for that to happen. You know that, right?	Yeah.That's my favorite t-shirt.And this...my favorite skin!	Oh, no.
Good sign? Dude, I am so sure Carla's gonna say yes, if she doesn't I'll power-walk naked through these halls singing "Me and Bobby McGee"!	We just keep missing each other. I'm not sweating it.She asked me to pick her up from the airport! That's a good sign, right!	All right, man. I understand.Still nothing?!	I'm not leaving this spot until she calls.	Woo-hooooo! She's thinkin', she's thinkin', and we should go out drinkin'! chicka uh-huh chicka-chicka.... Wanna get a beer?
Why would I take offense to that?	Ahhh, Janis Joplin! My God, she was an uggo! No offense, sport uh, don't think I have anything against ugly people.	Good sign? Dude, I am so sure Carla's gonna say yes, if she doesn't I'll power-walk naked through these halls singing "Me and Bobby McGee"!	We just keep missing each other. I'm not sweating it.She asked me to pick her up from the airport! That's a good sign, right!	All right, man. I understand.Still nothing?!
Dr. Townshend is like the Anti-Kelso.	No reason. Anyway, I see you're on the nephrology service for Dr. Townshend this month!	Why would I take offense to that?	Ahhh, Janis Joplin! My God, she was an uggo! No offense, sport uh, don't think I have anything against ugly people.	Good sign? Dude, I am so sure Carla's gonna say yes, if she doesn't I'll power-walk naked through these halls singing "Me and Bobby McGee"!
The nurses love him...	Hey, Doc!	Dr. Townshend is like the Anti-Kelso.	No reason. Anyway, I see you're on the nephrology service for Dr. Townshend this month!	Why would I take offense to that?
The attendings love him....	Betty! That color is great on you!	The nurses love him...	Hey, Doc!	Dr. Townshend is like the Anti-Kelso.
That that wouldn't be fun....	Well, how 'bout this: How 'bout he be the house slave, and I be the field slave. That sound like fun to you?	Oh, no, I don I don't mean like _that_ kind of slave.	Our own personal _what_, now?	That was good, Kevin! We should we should make him, like, make dinner for us tonight. He could be our own personal slave!
So often in a hospital, you feel like you're alone on an island. Whether it's because you just can't bring yourself to make a really important decision...	Grab a scalpel; I'll get the kit.Somebody?	But, sir, I don't	Nah, come on, let's do "old school."	Uh, sir, shouldn't I just do a modified Seldinger? I mean, it's so much safer.
Or because you're waiting for an answer...	Carla looking at her ring.	So often in a hospital, you feel like you're alone on an island. Whether it's because you just can't bring yourself to make a really important decision...	Grab a scalpel; I'll get the kit.Somebody?	But, sir, I don't
Or simply because you know a secret you wish you didn't.	Turk lost in thought.	Or because you're waiting for an answer...	Carla looking at her ring.	So often in a hospital, you feel like you're alone on an island. Whether it's because you just can't bring yourself to make a really important decision...
For me, I was stuck on that island because somebody else put me there.	Elliot nervously passing a hopeful Cox.	Or simply because you know a secret you wish you didn't.	Turk lost in thought.	Or because you're waiting for an answer...
Oh, no.	Okay, come on now, just cut through.... Good. Now, open up the vein.... But be careful not to nick the carotid artery.Oh, boy.	For me, I was stuck on that island because somebody else put me there.	Elliot nervously passing a hopeful Cox.	Or simply because you know a secret you wish you didn't.
Of course, there's always ramifications....	I'm out.	Like putting someone else's feelings first for a change.Even if it goes against what you really want.	This is to my brother, y'all! My brother!	It's not always easy to do the right thing.
No reason.	Why would you say that?	You think it's my fault he got fired, don't you.	Yeeeeeeee-ha!	My car....
Yeah. Feel free to return the favor.	You're giving me advice?	Well, it'd only take fifteen minutes of your life, and it wouldn't hurt to be in good with him for once.	Really?	You should just do it.
What's that supposed to mean?	Fair enough. Try this on for size: No matter where you go in life, always keep an eye out for Johnny, the tackling Alzheimer's patient.	Yeah. Feel free to return the favor.	You're giving me advice?	Well, it'd only take fifteen minutes of your life, and it wouldn't hurt to be in good with him for once.
I'm pressing the button.... It's not working.	Hey! Hold that elevator!	I got nothing.	I just got my vertebrae fused.	How's it going?
No. I...came over here to tell you that I traded with another resident and switched off your service for a while.	So, what'd you come by to tell me you're a complete wuss?	I've been doing some thinking, about how you're always blaming me for everything, and how you just send a constant stream of crap my way...and...I decided I need a break.	If it isn't my favorite career counselor. You wouldn't happen to have any more tips on how to climb _down_ the ladder, would ya?	"Two bits."
Because you did this!	Yeah.... I'm afraid it might be a little while.	Hi, yeah, I'm stuck in the elevator?	Bat Cave.	"Everybody was kung-fu fighting!" "Those cats were fast as lighten "
Hello?	Aw, now, I think we both know you did this to yourself. Well, I'll let you go.	Because you did this!	Yeah.... I'm afraid it might be a little while.	Hi, yeah, I'm stuck in the elevator?
Lame! This guy.	You guys, you know, I've just gotten to know you as a couple, but you remind me of my grandparents. They were married for sixty-five years, and every night before Grandpa and Grandma would walk around the block, he would look deep into her eyes as if to say, "I'd follow you anywhere." Anyway, the way you two just looked at each other, I could have sworn I was looking at them.	How's that taste, Blondie!	Okay, I'll, uh, I'll go ahead and and make a little toast, here. Uh, a toast that only people that've known...Turk and Carla more than a week will understand. You guys rock. You do.	Sure, Paul was dating Elliot. But, luckily, I'm not the jealous type.
So, what was up with Mr. Simms back there?	No you cannot, my friend. No you cannot!	You can't teach that.	See, now, what you want to do is choke up on the club like this? And then hit this bad boy like a baseball!	Yes, Doctor.
Are you gonna tell him?	Ahhh, during his open-lung biopsy, I accidentally nicked his intercostal artery, and now he's got a hematoma.	So, what was up with Mr. Simms back there?	No you cannot, my friend. No you cannot!	You can't teach that.
Yeah, but...don't you believe in bad karma?	What, and risk a lawsuit? Are you crazy? Besides, it'll heal just fine, anyway. Hey, throw me another ball.	Are you gonna tell him?	Ahhh, during his open-lung biopsy, I accidentally nicked his intercostal artery, and now he's got a hematoma.	So, what was up with Mr. Simms back there?
I guess it's hard to predict how a person will react.	Ever!	Ever?	Let's not tell anyone! Ever! Ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever! EVER!	Let's come clean.
But what if she has the baby while I'm in there?	Uh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh! Please! Just...check on her, 'kay? All right.	Dr. Cox	Gimme a break I got a lot on my mind, Ellen! Ooh! Look at that! I bounced back! A-hey-anyway, the cave bat just kicked me out of its lair, and seeing as I no longer have my all-access pass to crazy town, I'm going to need you to occasionally go in there and poke her with a broomstick, just to see how she's doing.	What?
Well, you sound good.	Well, I have ruined everything! All he tried to do was take care of me and show me that he loved me. But, no, I had to drive him away because I don't like being vulnerable even when I'm normal, let alone with my ankles in stirrups and my coochie on display. So, now he's gone away for good; and I would really like to get this stupid thing out of me so I can go home and kill myself!	Yep. So...? How ya doin'?	He asked you to...check in on me?	Look, Dr. Cox asked me to check in on you; I'm sorry I haven't been here until now.
What are you talking about?	I was going to tell him the truth eventually, I just wanted to see if he was going to be with me because he _wanted_ to, not because he _had_ to. Do you know what I mean?	Well, you sound good.	Well, I have ruined everything! All he tried to do was take care of me and show me that he loved me. But, no, I had to drive him away because I don't like being vulnerable even when I'm normal, let alone with my ankles in stirrups and my coochie on display. So, now he's gone away for good; and I would really like to get this stupid thing out of me so I can go home and kill myself!	Yep. So...? How ya doin'?
....Or about being who you really are.Either way, it's a lot to think about.	So, uh...anyway, Mr. Simms, I wanted to explain to you why your chest was hurting? During surgery, I....	...you can't hide from it.Karma's really just about doing the right thing.	Hi, Dr. Kelso!	Because I honestly believe, if you've got some bad karma coming your way, well...
...Yeah....	Oh, my God. Would you look at the mug on Jordan's baby? Must have one butt-ugly father!	....Or about being who you really are.Either way, it's a lot to think about.	So, uh...anyway, Mr. Simms, I wanted to explain to you why your chest was hurting? During surgery, I....	...you can't hide from it.Karma's really just about doing the right thing.
Chet, you suck!!!AAARRRGGGHHH!!!You know what, some stereotypes are true, Turk. Okay? And, just maybe, black people are a little better at basketball. Whatta you say?	Sorry, man.	How the hell did we lose?! We have Chet!	And that's game!	Grrrrrr.
Gotcha! Finished!	What?	I haven't even started yet.	Well, now, Maggie! I can only assume that you are whiling away the morning cat-chatting with your favorite gal-pal because you've already finished your pre-rounding?	What?
I could tell you some stories.	That's a good one, Newbie. My heart is racing. You are quite the prankster.	Gotcha! Finished!	What?	I haven't even started yet.
Well, is there anything I need to do for her lung nodule?	And if there's a God in heaven, you never will. This is Mrs. Gracin's chart her private practice doctor just showed up, so I am off this one.	I could tell you some stories.	That's a good one, Newbie. My heart is racing. You are quite the prankster.	Gotcha! Finished!
Great. Another pretentious private practice guy who's gonna order me around while he counts his money all day.	Oh, I don't know. What do you say you start her on 20 CCs of It's not my problem anymore!	Well, is there anything I need to do for her lung nodule?	And if there's a God in heaven, you never will. This is Mrs. Gracin's chart her private practice doctor just showed up, so I am off this one.	I could tell you some stories.
Ha!	You're probably thinking, Why didn't you do that before I got here? But you weren't sure if you'd be over-stepping your boundaries. What if I was some sort of territorial ass with a giant ego or a territorial ego with a giant ass. Stop me, Sally, please!	Yeah, we yeah.	You know what I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you; I do want to hear the end of that story, though could you get a pulmonary consult for Sally for me?	You know, I'm always pulling pranks, too. Like, before, Dr. Cox was like, "Did you do that pre-rounding?"
What's up his pooper?	We have a little history.... Yeah....	Oh, Jay! You're so crazy!	...Well, it's not uncommon! I think a lot of people keep, uh, plants in their apartment. Right, J.D.?	Sometimes, when you're in an awkward situation, the best thing to do is to go to your happy place.
Yeah.	Actually, I think he's mad 'cause I went into private practice and he's stuck in this hell-hole.	What's up his pooper?	We have a little history.... Yeah....	Oh, Jay! You're so crazy!
That's lame.	You wouldn't believe this, but that guy was my mentor, man. I mean, I lived and breathed for that guy's approval.	Yeah.	Actually, I think he's mad 'cause I went into private practice and he's stuck in this hell-hole.	What's up his pooper?
Tell me about it.	I know! Once you learn the tricks, though, he's easier to deal with; you'll see.	That's lame.	You wouldn't believe this, but that guy was my mentor, man. I mean, I lived and breathed for that guy's approval.	Yeah.
No, no, I'm serious tell me about it.	Yeah!	Tell me about it.	I know! Once you learn the tricks, though, he's easier to deal with; you'll see.	That's lame.
No, I do. Now, how do you get him to stop calling you girl's names.	Oh! Ohh. Uh, well, you know when he gets on his rants, he gets all hyped up, his vein starts sticking out of his neck, and he starts yelling at ya when he's done, just look at him, stare him right in the eye, and say, "I'm sorry, what were you saying?"I don't know why, but it works; trust me.	No, no, I'm serious tell me about it.	Yeah!	Tell me about it.
Oh. Nevermind.	Girl's names?	No, I do. Now, how do you get him to stop calling you girl's names.	Oh! Ohh. Uh, well, you know when he gets on his rants, he gets all hyped up, his vein starts sticking out of his neck, and he starts yelling at ya when he's done, just look at him, stare him right in the eye, and say, "I'm sorry, what were you saying?"I don't know why, but it works; trust me.	No, no, I'm serious tell me about it.
My grandma died!	Newbie!	Okay, think of something believable. Grandma died! No, no, no, no, don't do that...because if she does die, you'll feel awful; and, let's face it, she's no spring chicken. I should call her. But then, whenever we talk, I have nothing to say how 'bout asking me how I am for once!	Oh, what plans!?	I have plans tonight.
Ta-DOW!	Jealous!	Laverne?	No, I'm _not_.	Ohhh, my God! You're actually jealous that I'm hanging out with another doctor!
Don't worry about it, champ. It's all right to need me.	Look, Marcia, if I were you, I'd drop this jealousy thing right now.	Ta-DOW!	Jealous!	Laverne?
He's doing it!	I think so.All right, go.Hold it! Nah.	That was a good one.	What is wrong with you?	Do you not see the hate?
Or...we could just...leave it on this station....	No big deal! I'll, uh, you know, do one of these change the channel.	Cool! These guys are finally starting to get along!...Or not.	Look at Rockefeller! Pass me the remote, buddy!	Hey! Do you guys mind if I turn on CNN? My grandma bought me a stock I wanna see how it's doing.
That's a lie! You bought me a latte!Hey, guys.	Hey, for what it's worth, I didn't make the first move.	Ahh, he just wouldn't be Dr. Cox if he didn't refer to me as a 'her.'	And worse than that, you did it knowing full-well just exactly how I felt about her.	That seemed a little possessive...but I'm flattered!
Who cares if Jordan wants to keep it a secret? Tell him it's his baby! Scream it from the mountains!	I never blamed Jordan. I was a chief resident, I was here all the time, and I always made damn-sure she knew she came second. But, God almighty, I'm trying harder this time. I just hope I'm doing the right thing, you know?	That you're allowed to talk?	Still no talking in the bathroom, Newbie.You know what's weird?	Hey, Dr. Cox!
...or security's victories over you.	Doc-Doc-Dr. Kelso?	Around here, you have to grab hold of the littlest victories.Whether it's victories over your insecurities....	Oh!	Hey, Jordan. How' ya doin'?
Either way, you gotta choose your battles.	Dr. Kelso!	...or security's victories over you.	Doc-Doc-Dr. Kelso?	Around here, you have to grab hold of the littlest victories.Whether it's victories over your insecurities....
I think you're allowed to do whatever you want, Mrs. Moyer.	Actually, I was just calculating how much time I need to spend here so I don't feel guilty all week.... And now I need to double it, because I can't believe I just said that.	You know...he's he's the same. How are you doing?	How's he doing?	T.C.W. is a horrible story.She was married for three weeks before her husband got in a car accident and became a total vegetable. He's been on life support for the last two years; and since he was transferred to our hospital a month ago, she's visited every Wednesday. Very, very sad.Oh, yeah, and she's a babe! We call her "Tasty Coma Wife" or "T.C.W." for short.
"Jamie"?	Please, call me Jamie.	I think you're allowed to do whatever you want, Mrs. Moyer.	Actually, I was just calculating how much time I need to spend here so I don't feel guilty all week.... And now I need to double it, because I can't believe I just said that.	You know...he's he's the same. How are you doing?
Okay.	Mm-hmm.	"Jamie"?	Please, call me Jamie.	I think you're allowed to do whatever you want, Mrs. Moyer.
What is it?	You have something on your cheek.	Okay.	Mm-hmm.	"Jamie"?

Oh. Did you get it?	Yeah, I get it.	Workin' in a hospital...it's always...something.	Here.	What is it?
Heh.	Pff! Hell no!	Not that I need any help.	I'll go.I totally need to blow off some steam. Plus, the best way to meet skanky hos is to already have a girl with you.	Oh, come on, player, just a few beers! And if we accidentally run into some skanky hos, then so be it!
Oh?	You got something right....	Heh.	Pff! Hell no!	Not that I need any help.
Yeah.	What's it, uh, biscuit and gravy day?	O...kay, I'm I'm sorry about the "nice day" thing. How can I make this right?	You always gotta have something to say, don't ya? Old nosy nelly, always gotta throw his two cents in.	Nice day, huh?
I thought you were ready.	Just give me one of them biscuits.	Yeah.	What's it, uh, biscuit and gravy day?	O...kay, I'm I'm sorry about the "nice day" thing. How can I make this right?
I'm glad!	I can't believe I'm actually having fun!	No, no, no.... Her ass was way too perfect.	Did you like her?	a little aggressive! Sorry.
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry; I've heard some idiots call you that.	So, "Tasty Coma Wife," huh?	I'm glad!	I can't believe I'm actually having fun!	No, no, no.... Her ass was way too perfect.
I thought it up.	I kinda like it.	Oh, yeah, I'm sorry; I've heard some idiots call you that.	So, "Tasty Coma Wife," huh?	I'm glad!
So, I'm not gonna sweat it just because I made a new friend, you know? I mean, what's the big deal?	Oh.	...or just desperately trying to get some attention.	Ahhhhhhhh!	Whether they're considering breaking up over a Slim Jim......or having their stomach pumped...
Hey.	Hey!	So, I'm not gonna sweat it just because I made a new friend, you know? I mean, what's the big deal?	Oh.	...or just desperately trying to get some attention.
Mr. Moyer!	My husband.	Jack?	Jack wouldn't want my life to be over.	Holy crap!
I'd rather not.	Call him Jack.	Mr. Moyer!	My husband.	Jack?
Of course.	I know it's weird. But give it some thought, okay?	I'd rather not.	Call him Jack.	Mr. Moyer!
Yeah....	Dude! Was thatWas that Tasty Coma Wife?	Yeah.	All right, I'll see ya.	Hey.
"Chink!"Oh, no, no. No, Franklyn, we were we were, um, we were doing a crossword puzzle, and....	What?	"Chink."	Five letters. "Showing vulnerability. 'A blank in one's armor'"...?	Good cover!
Ow.It's just been sorta hard for me lately, you know? I don't really have anyone special in my life, and...I'm pretty much either here or at home doing nothing, and....	Oh.	Oh, you're imagining things.	Word to the wise, there, Astro: Sarcasm does not sit well with the Big Dog, so consider this a warning. Because the next time I hear you mumble some snarky little passive-aggressive aside, I'm going to look into your heart, pick out your greatest insecurity, and shine the world's brightest spotlight on it for the remainder of your natural-born days. Now, riddle me this, Fido: Just exactly why does every Asian person who's passing us by in the hallway, here, keep giving you the old stink-eye?	It doesn't show.
Uhh.... Honestly, I think you you might be moving a little fast for yourself. And there's a part of me that's very angry I just said that.	So, it's cold outside you wanna come back to my place?	Thank you, Rowdy!	Mm! You went left! Very cool.	I could do that.
I'll tell you what, if you look me in the eyes and you tell me that you're really ready to start something right now....we won't even need a cab I will, like, I will throw you over my shoulder and just sprint the twelve miles to your house!...But....	I'm so sick of being alone, you know?	Uhh.... Honestly, I think you you might be moving a little fast for yourself. And there's a part of me that's very angry I just said that.	So, it's cold outside you wanna come back to my place?	Thank you, Rowdy!
I hope you do.	I'll call you sometime.	I'll tell you what, if you look me in the eyes and you tell me that you're really ready to start something right now....we won't even need a cab I will, like, I will throw you over my shoulder and just sprint the twelve miles to your house!...But....	I'm so sick of being alone, you know?	Uhh.... Honestly, I think you you might be moving a little fast for yourself. And there's a part of me that's very angry I just said that.
I don't think people are meant to be by themselves.That's why, if you actually find someone you care about......it's important to let go of the little things....Even if you can't let go all the way.Because nothing sucks more than feeling all alone...no matter how many people are around.	Bye.	I hope you do.	I'll call you sometime.

Why _does_ an old hen need a banjo?	Why would an old hen need a banjo?	Why would you need a saw in a hospital?	A new circular saw just bought it! Four horse-power, thirty-five hundred RPMs, titanium finger guard....	We we were done with that one, right guys?What'cha got there?
You wouldn't! That'd be crazy.	Why would I buy a saw if I didn't have stuff to cut?	Why _does_ an old hen need a banjo?	Why would an old hen need a banjo?	Why would you need a saw in a hospital?
No thank you, I'm fine.	Exactly!Need some help with that?	You wouldn't! That'd be crazy.	Why would I buy a saw if I didn't have stuff to cut?	Why _does_ an old hen need a banjo?

Told ya you had nothing to saw.	Don't call me "Slappy-bag"!	Come on! Slappy-bag!	You've lost it.	Oh, yeah, we all went out last night, and I sorta made up some new nicknames for all the fellas. By the way, you're "Slappy-bag."
Oww, man! Give it back!	Oh, really?	Told ya you had nothing to saw.	Don't call me "Slappy-bag"!	Come on! Slappy-bag!
No!	All right. Just tell me why you're hitting yourself.Hm? Why you doing that?You ever get the feeling we're thinking the same thing?	Oww, man! Give it back!	Oh, really?	Told ya you had nothing to saw.
Hey, I'm J.D.! I'm so stoked to be your roommate! Right on!	Every second, since the moment I met you.	Not all the time!	J.D., look at me. You are a dork.	Man! Ever since college, you always make everything seem so easy. No matter where you are, you always fit in. I dunno, I guess I thought with this surgery elective, it might be nice not to feel like a total dork for once.
What are you talking about? I thought you said hoops were cool? Hey, baby! Cham-pahg-nee?Med school chicks love ventriloquists!	To go along with his cap and gown, J.D. has gotten his ear pierced with a huge gold ring.	Hey, I'm J.D.! I'm so stoked to be your roommate! Right on!	Every second, since the moment I met you.	Not all the time!
And that's why you hung out with me?	See, J.D., the thing that I always liked about you was that you were just yourself you never cared about what people thought.	Apple-tini, please. Easy on the -tini.	A few minutes ago.	Tannest intern, baby! And it comes in a bottle!
Come on, player! You know I'm way more stud than dud!Wow, you can really taste the apples!	No, you had a car. Still do.	And that's why you hung out with me?	See, J.D., the thing that I always liked about you was that you were just yourself you never cared about what people thought.	Apple-tini, please. Easy on the -tini.
No problem, Dougster.	Hey, J.D.? Do you have any nasal spray?	And other times, just makes you miss what you had....a little.As for me, I'm happy just knowing who I am.	By golly, you're so pretty, I may not even use you!	But sometimes change doesn't last for long.
For I am John Dorian King of the Nerds!	Yeah!	No problem, Dougster.	Hey, J.D.? Do you have any nasal spray?	And other times, just makes you miss what you had....a little.As for me, I'm happy just knowing who I am.
...Maybe you're trying to break in the soles of your new Italian shoes...	Dammit! Don't you die on me! Clear! Kgh-bgghhhh!	...or trying to live out your deepest fantasies.	Should I take a dookie before or after I lift weights? Mmmm....after!	Luckily, no one else'll bust my chops about the funeral. Because around here, you tend to get wrapped up in your own world.Whether you're trying to plan your day...
...or break down the spirit of your old whipping boy.	Sir, those shoes look a little small for you.	...Maybe you're trying to break in the soles of your new Italian shoes...	Dammit! Don't you die on me! Clear! Kgh-bgghhhh!	...or trying to live out your deepest fantasies.
As for me, no matter what Dr. Cox thinks, I wasn't going to that funeral to hit on Jamie.......I was going to pay my respects.	Whatever!	Isn't he fixing the heat down in Pediatrics?	I gotta fix my own damn copy machine 'cause the maintenance man claims he's got more important things to do!	One way or another, everyone finds a way to make it all about themselves.
Well, you look fantastic! And, you know, I don't mean "Hey, dude, check out that hot bitty at the bar!" 'fantastic' I'm talking about "I'm sorry for your loss" 'fantastic'.	J.D.! I'm so happy you came!	As for me, no matter what Dr. Cox thinks, I wasn't going to that funeral to hit on Jamie.......I was going to pay my respects.	Whatever!	Isn't he fixing the heat down in Pediatrics?
Yeah, let's get the hell out of here.	Do you wanna grab a drink?	Well, you look fantastic! And, you know, I don't mean "Hey, dude, check out that hot bitty at the bar!" 'fantastic' I'm talking about "I'm sorry for your loss" 'fantastic'.	J.D.! I'm so happy you came!	As for me, no matter what Dr. Cox thinks, I wasn't going to that funeral to hit on Jamie.......I was going to pay my respects.
Oh, yeah, I know! So so was I.	Oh, I was actually talking about him.	Yeah, let's get the hell out of here.	Do you wanna grab a drink?	Well, you look fantastic! And, you know, I don't mean "Hey, dude, check out that hot bitty at the bar!" 'fantastic' I'm talking about "I'm sorry for your loss" 'fantastic'.
Somebody's a smoker!	Oh, no! You have to order he's bussing those.	Oh, yeah, I know! So so was I.	Oh, I was actually talking about him.	Yeah, let's get the hell out of here.
Oh! Oh! Heh. I'm sorry, everyone. I...I dropped something on my toe. "Ahhhhhh!...AHHAAAAHHHH!" ...You know.... Carry on.	Whoops!	I'll see ya.	Well...goodbye....	Nice job!
You're at war!	I'm at peace.	You're sad.	I'm happy!	You've never been more confused.
Oh, I was outside, in the bushes.	Where were you?	Last night, when you were showering.	When did you see my penis?	Look, uh..........JanitorI'm gonna be straight with you: I saw your penis, and I noticed a possible melanoma that you should really have checked out.
Look, it was just a coincidence, man I mean, i-i-if you had looked out the window, you'd have seen my penis, you know!	Uhhh....	Oh, I was outside, in the bushes.	Where were you?	Last night, when you were showering.
Because I had it out while I was looking at yours!	What!?! Why?	Look, it was just a coincidence, man I mean, i-i-if you had looked out the window, you'd have seen my penis, you know!	Uhhh....	Oh, I was outside, in the bushes.
Oh.	No, first time....	Hermann the German! You must get that all the time!	Hey, you must be Dr. Dorian. I am, uh, Rolf's brother, Hermann.	Okay, regroup.
Uh, well, uh, I could really use your help translating.	Let's hope it catches on!	Oh.	No, first time....	Hermann the German! You must get that all the time!
Uh, I got the, uh, results back from your biopsy...	Oh, sure.	Uh, well, uh, I could really use your help translating.	Let's hope it catches on!	Oh.
...the lesions in your liver...	Wir werden dich zu einem...	Uh, I got the, uh, results back from your biopsy...	Oh, sure.	Uh, well, uh, I could really use your help translating.
...are... consistent with metastatic pancreatic cancer.	Es sieht so aus, als ob du...	...the lesions in your liver...	Wir werden dich zu einem...	Uh, I got the, uh, results back from your biopsy...
Germans!	Yeah! I can do a sweet little milkmaid: Guten Morgen, möchten Sie die Kühe melken?I can do an evil old hausfrau : ESS DEIN SCHNITZEL, SONST KRIEGST DU KEIN NACHTISCH! J.D.: German's such a beautiful language.... Anyhoo, I think Mr. Mueller's so amazing. I mean, yesterday, I pretty much told him he was gonna die; and his brother turned to him and he said, "Es wird alles wieder gut." And Mr. Mueller just accepted it!Well, why wouldn't he? "Es wird alles wieder gut" means "You're going to be fine."	You speak German?	Hey! I just met your patient, Mr. Mueller; we had such a nice chat.	Eh, but what do I know about good relationships? Two days ago, I had funeral sex.
Da!	That's good, yes?	His Biliary obstruction's relieved, and he's taking P.O.	We got Mr. Mueller's ultrasound back.	Fine, just tell him that lying to his brother isn't gonna make him any better!
Who are these lovely people?	Uhh.	I treated a patient today who was mad at his brother for presuming to know what's best for him. And that got me thinking. Because I was freaking out that we hooked up in the closet at the funeral, I did the same thing to you! So...if you're really ready, let's go for it! 'Cause, I'm crazy about you, and you're right your husband's gone, and he's never coming back!	J.D.? Wha ?	Excuse me, Jamie?
Oh, God. How can I make this right?If only....	These are my late husband's parents.	Who are these lovely people?	Uhh.	I treated a patient today who was mad at his brother for presuming to know what's best for him. And that got me thinking. Because I was freaking out that we hooked up in the closet at the funeral, I did the same thing to you! So...if you're really ready, let's go for it! 'Cause, I'm crazy about you, and you're right your husband's gone, and he's never coming back!
Still, things are going pretty well with me and Jamie.	Just enough so it still hurts.	Sweetie, it is!Now, exactly how much feeling am I supposed to lose in my extremities?	J.D., I really wanted tonight to be romantic.	What?
Oh, no, this a a rash from my new watch. They didn't tell me the band was made out of....cat.	Looks like rope-burn to me.	Still, things are going pretty well with me and Jamie.	Just enough so it still hurts.	Sweetie, it is!Now, exactly how much feeling am I supposed to lose in my extremities?
Yes! Have you been drinking?	Oh, so now I'm a janitor?	I didn't say "lowly."	Yeah. What, I don't get to wear shorts, 'cause I'm just a lowly janitor?	Shorts, huh?
I love your shorts, okay? I wish I had a pair just like 'em.	I'm not _drunk_.	Yes! Have you been drinking?	Oh, so now I'm a janitor?	I didn't say "lowly."
Man, once Dr. Cox gets on a roll, there's nothing that can derail him.	No, it's a cotillion joke. My God, Newbie, it's been two furiously frustrating years how is it possible that you still don't get me? I would never compare you to the gays! I like the gays I like their music, I like their sense of style, I especially like what they've done with Halloween but _our thing_ is that you are a _little girl_. That's who you are! But that's really not fair....	Is that a gay joke?	Oh, gosh, Shannon, thank you _so much_ for clarifying my point by repeating it word for word. And now, in a reciprocal gesture, can I be included in the planning of your coming out party?	It's on you, pardner!
I tell her way too much.	_Not_ the Rerun Dance.	Mm!What are you two talking 'bout?	Come on, ladies! It's right hand, left hand, shoulder-pop, jump! Right hand, left hand, shoulder-pop, jump!	Whenever I see two beautiful women that I've been intimate with talking to each other, I always have the same fantasy....
Oh, thanks!	You left some stuff in my apartment.	I tell her way too much.	_Not_ the Rerun Dance.	Mm!What are you two talking 'bout?
Mmm....	See ya.	Oh, thanks!	You left some stuff in my apartment.	I tell her way too much.
We're doing fine!	You wanna know why things with Jamie are so 'lamey'?	Mmm....	See ya.	Oh, thanks!
Wrong! She just came by because she knows today at work, I need my......squash goggles.	Oh, please! She's clearing you out of her apartment!	We're doing fine!	You wanna know why things with Jamie are so 'lamey'?	Mmm....
I have to saw something later.	Mm.	Wrong! She just came by because she knows today at work, I need my......squash goggles.	Oh, please! She's clearing you out of her apartment!	We're doing fine!
Well, Jamie is not like you, okay!?	She's a drama queen, J.D.! When her husband was in a coma, it was all, like, taboo and exciting; but now that it's okay for the two of you to be together, the relationship's got no snap...it's got no crackle. J.D.... It's got no pop. I know! Because I'm a drama queen, too!	I have to saw something later.	Mm.	Wrong! She just came by because she knows today at work, I need my......squash goggles.
Ditditditdit!	No Pop!	Well, Jamie is not like you, okay!?	She's a drama queen, J.D.! When her husband was in a coma, it was all, like, taboo and exciting; but now that it's okay for the two of you to be together, the relationship's got no snap...it's got no crackle. J.D.... It's got no pop. I know! Because I'm a drama queen, too!	I have to saw something later.
Yes!	What?	Yeah, I know. I was gonna wear 'em, but you know someone went and stole them out of my locker!	Anyway, what's the deal? We're supposed to be shorts buddies today. You saw the schedule: Monday-Tuesday, shorts; Wednesday, we wash 'em; Thursday-Friday, shorts; weekend, optional I'll be wearing shorts.	I think I would.
As a doctor, you get good at thinking on your feet. I was able to protect the Janitor's feelings, plus, he totally bought it!	Let me see!	Yes!	What?	Yeah, I know. I was gonna wear 'em, but you know someone went and stole them out of my locker!
I'm warning you! Stop eyeballing my woman!	Jamie is cuddled up to J.D. as he forcefully addresses a midget.	Because I don't want salad, that's why!Look, Jamie and I are gonna be together, and I don't care what you think, Dad!	On a date with Jamie, J.D. talks forcefully to the waiter.	Look, Jamie and I are gonna be together, and I don't care what you think, Mom!
No, it was definitely that guy!	Actually, J.D., I think it was that guy!	I'm warning you! Stop eyeballing my woman!	Jamie is cuddled up to J.D. as he forcefully addresses a midget.	Because I don't want salad, that's why!Look, Jamie and I are gonna be together, and I don't care what you think, Dad!
Because you're not right!	Why can't you just admit that I'm right?	I don't know. How are you? Zinnnnng!	So, how's the drama queen doing?	Unfortunately, I was running out of ideas.
Thanks.	Still, if it helps:	Yeah.	I think you just have to gamble that once all the drama's gone, there's still gonna be something there. If not, it's her loss.	Asking you not to show up at my apartment drunk, naked, and crying. You know what's weird? I really like this girl, but I'm not sure I can keep it going with all the drama.
Nope.	Can't wear shorts to work?	Look, I'm sorry, okay? For...so many things. But, I'm a doctor I can't really wear shorts to work.	What's the big deal? Well, the Good Lord didn't bless my wife with all ten fingers. She's only got pointer...and...thumb-pinkie.	She just cut off a pair of scrubs and hemmed the bottom. What's the big deal?
Not allowed!	Can't wear shorts to _work_?	Nope.	Can't wear shorts to work?	Look, I'm sorry, okay? For...so many things. But, I'm a doctor I can't really wear shorts to work.
Oh, nothing. I'm just trying to mend some fences.	Thanks. What's up with the man-____?	Not allowed!	Can't wear shorts to _work_?	Nope.
Oh, without a doubt.... But not about me. No, I...I kinda made all that stuff up. It just seems like you and I only really click when something crazy is going on.	So, do you think Elliot's somewhere right now, crying her eyes out?	Oh, nothing. I'm just trying to mend some fences.	Thanks. What's up with the man-____?	Not allowed!
I dunno, I guess I realized I don't really want to be in a relationship like that.	Mm.	Oh, without a doubt.... But not about me. No, I...I kinda made all that stuff up. It just seems like you and I only really click when something crazy is going on.	So, do you think Elliot's somewhere right now, crying her eyes out?	Oh, nothing. I'm just trying to mend some fences.
No, Jamie, no! It's not an ultimatum, it's just something to think about.Oh, shoot, I gotta go!	Is that an ultimatum?	I dunno, I guess I realized I don't really want to be in a relationship like that.	Mm.	Oh, without a doubt.... But not about me. No, I...I kinda made all that stuff up. It just seems like you and I only really click when something crazy is going on.
Carla...college wasn't all sex and coats. Spence, here, got me through a lot of hard times.	Who else! Who else did you bang??	YES! On a pile of coats with hundreds of people around! What a whore!	Leslie Stevens!	You know, guys, I don't think it's really appropriate for us to be rehashing our college sexual conquests with Carla in the other room
Yes!My life changed that day.	Why don't you just mousse the crap out of it straight up!	Carla...college wasn't all sex and coats. Spence, here, got me through a lot of hard times.	Who else! Who else did you bang??	YES! On a pile of coats with hundreds of people around! What a whore!
Dream job....	Now that's one of the perks you never hear about. So, you guys pretty much landed your dream jobs, huh?	Yeah. You know what? Maybe it would just be easier if I told you whose butt I _haven't_ had my fingers in?	That guy?	Yeah.
Mm-mm-mm.	Hey, man? How am I supposed to finish this memo?	Dream job....	Now that's one of the perks you never hear about. So, you guys pretty much landed your dream jobs, huh?	Yeah. You know what? Maybe it would just be easier if I told you whose butt I _haven't_ had my fingers in?
"Should we get started?" Answer: yes.	Excuse me?	Yes!	All right. Shall we get started?	Every year at this time, Kelso picks a resident to ride mercilessly until they crumble. The key is to jump on any easy question and impress him early.
No, my PIN number is 3674.	No...that's your PIN number.	That's my social security number!	Right. 'Cause there's no way I could access the personnel files. Just impossible!By the way, uh: 987-65-4320	You couldn't have seen my paycheck.
Do you have any idea what it feels like to have a janitor make more money than you?	Bingo!	No, my PIN number is 3674.	No...that's your PIN number.	That's my social security number!
Look, Dr. Cox....	Newsflash: you can't drink and then come to work you're not airline pilots!	Uh, we...we, uh, we had a few.	Hey, Betty. Hey, Wilma. Oh, what the hell, you're only forty minutes late. Do I...do I smell beer?	Of course, sometimes it's just having to work in wet grundies.
And you have to have that desire, because at the end of your second year it's impossible to see the light at the end of the tunnel.So it becomes about perseverance......and fortitude......and sacrifice.	That was disgusting.	...The reason we're doctors is because we have an innate desire to help people.	Aaaaah.	As I bent down to eat that peppered floor turkey, unaware that the cleanser the Janitor uses is an extremely potent diuretic, I realized something.
Ohhh! How cool was that!	Nice call on the anti-seizure medication, there, Newbie. You know I'm actually starting to think you may not be the worst resident that ever lived.	You're welcome.	So I'm supposed to be happy because someone finally did something right?	I'm so glad the medication worked on your foot.
You shut up. You're an angry man!I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the whole "it's your baby" thing.We'll probably talk about that later.	Shut up.	Ohhh! How cool was that!	Nice call on the anti-seizure medication, there, Newbie. You know I'm actually starting to think you may not be the worst resident that ever lived.	You're welcome.
No?	You know I'm I wasn't even mad at Jordan.	You shut up. You're an angry man!I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the whole "it's your baby" thing.We'll probably talk about that later.	Shut up.	Ohhh! How cool was that!
You? Come on! You're gonna be a very scary fath I mean a great...you're gonna be a great father. Like last night, when you totally kicked our asses 'cause we deserved it? And do you remember that time you told me I wasn't the worst resident that ever lived?	No, I was scared. In fact, I was freaking out all day, because I'm quite confident that I'm gonna be an absolutely horrible father.	No?	You know I'm I wasn't even mad at Jordan.	You shut up. You're an angry man!I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the whole "it's your baby" thing.We'll probably talk about that later.
You have no idea how much that meant to me.	You mean like eight seconds ago?	You? Come on! You're gonna be a very scary fath I mean a great...you're gonna be a great father. Like last night, when you totally kicked our asses 'cause we deserved it? And do you remember that time you told me I wasn't the worst resident that ever lived?	No, I was scared. In fact, I was freaking out all day, because I'm quite confident that I'm gonna be an absolutely horrible father.	No?
But, Dr. Cox, you're always there when we need you! I think you have this fathering thing down!	I said I _think_ you may not be the worst resident ever, but I can't be sure of stuff like that. Come on, I haven't done the appropriate leg work!	You have no idea how much that meant to me.	You mean like eight seconds ago?	You? Come on! You're gonna be a very scary fath I mean a great...you're gonna be a great father. Like last night, when you totally kicked our asses 'cause we deserved it? And do you remember that time you told me I wasn't the worst resident that ever lived?
And of course....	Remember: No more dancing.Pow!Good morning, Bambi. Sign this, please?Who you eyeballing, tough guy?	As a third-year resident, you know everyone so well you can practically speak for them. For instance....	Fine. Then I'll just put on something that rocks!	Morning, Steven.
Well, Zsa Zsa. Now you've put me in quite the pickle. You see, with those earphones on, you can't hear me; but! the odds are highly against you cracking open that yapper and annoying me today. So, what to do? What to do? What to do? Ahh, hell	And of course....	Remember: No more dancing.Pow!Good morning, Bambi. Sign this, please?Who you eyeballing, tough guy?

See, things never really change around here....Surgical and Medical still play each other in basketball.	Stop addressing me as "Dr. Cox" in front of your patients. When they find out my actual name, they tend to page me with questions when they realize just exactly how inept you really are. Oh, and as an added safety measure, from now on, I'll only be responding to "Doc," "Doctor," "Ceasar," or "The Big Cheese;" and noooo, I'm _not_ joking. Not _now_ not ever.	Well, Zsa Zsa. Now you've put me in quite the pickle. You see, with those earphones on, you can't hear me; but! the odds are highly against you cracking open that yapper and annoying me today. So, what to do?

Yeah? Well I heard that your sister started drinking again!	I'm gonna toast you so bad, your momma ain't even gonna recognize you!

So, it's not supposed to be true?	I'm still not great at smack-talk.	Yeah? Well I heard that your sister started drinking again!	I'm gonna toast you so bad, your momma ain't even gonna recognize you!	See, things never really change around here....Surgical and Medical still play each other in basketball.
And Elliot was still searching for something to turn things around for her.	No. Ohhh, let it pour, big guy.	So, it's not supposed to be true?	I'm still not great at smack-talk.	Yeah? Well I heard that your sister started drinking again!
Like I said, once you hit the third year, there aren't a lot of surprises.	You look beautiful.	And if something does change, more often than not it just reminds you of feelings you've had all along.	Now, I would've never figured it out unless you guys had done the leg work. You four deserve all the credit, really.Mrs. Farr, Dr. Cox has saved the day! Don't ya just love it? Come here!	Not only is the status quo good for work, it's also somewhat comforting.
"...Livin' in a lonely world! She took a midnight train goin' aaaanywheeeere!" Fine, I love 'em. If you wanna book the band, they're called The Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin's and they rock! Book 'em now, thank me later.	"She's just a small town girl..."	I don't _love_ Journey.	Bambi, not everyone loves Journey as much as you.	Marcia, please!No, I have not!
Turk, why are you so afraid of loving me?	Sounds like you're asking me out on a man-date.	You should...talk to Carla....	You mean Tamika and Fuquan?	Anyway, about this whole setting the date thing: I mean, I'm really psyched for you guys, it's just gonna be harder and harder for us to hang out, you know? I mean, you're gonna be married, man! You're gonna have, like, a house! You know? You're gonna be spending your weekends chasing around little Arturo and Rosaria!
Other times you fight for what you want...	Shut up.	Sometimes you fight them not because you want to, but because you have to....	Can I have everyone's attention please? I officially don't care anymore who peed in this jar!	In a hospital, every day is made up of little battles.
...but what you want isn't willing to wait.	Sean, I can't make it to dinner.	Other times you fight for what you want...	Shut up.	Sometimes you fight them not because you want to, but because you have to....
If you're lucky, there's no battle at all everything works out perfectly.	Sure, Elliot...yeah....	...but what you want isn't willing to wait.	Sean, I can't make it to dinner.	Other times you fight for what you want...
I don't understand. Ever since I met you it's been like this one-way street. I mean, I-I-I-I tell you everything, and you tell me nothing. I don't get it what are you afraid of?	Finally! Thank you.	I'm not talking to you!	Aw, dammit all! I never tell you how _I_ feel.	You never tell me how you feel!
You know, the fact that you're even here for an end-of-an-era celebration is enough we don't have to, like, get all deep or anything.	Heh.	Well you're gonna be very pleased with the next twenty-three songs.	You know, I'm actually starting to like Journey.	I'm always happy when someone wins a battle. Because around here, you get your fair share of disappointment.I guess in the end you have to fight for things that really matter. Like pride in your work......or your friendship.
Uh-huh?	No, I wanna try this, man. Okay, Um.... Ever since Carla and I set the date for the wedding, I started thinking. You know those lame-ass couples that get engaged but they never actually get married they just cruise along, year after year, without making any real kind of commitment?	You know, the fact that you're even here for an end-of-an-era celebration is enough we don't have to, like, get all deep or anything.	Heh.	Well you're gonna be very pleased with the next twenty-three songs.
Hey, Puki, can we get two appletinis, please?	Dude, I wanted to be one of those couples, man!	Uh-huh?	No, I wanna try this, man. Okay, Um.... Ever since Carla and I set the date for the wedding, I started thinking. You know those lame-ass couples that get engaged but they never actually get married they just cruise along, year after year, without making any real kind of commitment?	You know, the fact that you're even here for an end-of-an-era celebration is enough we don't have to, like, get all deep or anything.
Dan, don't! That's dad's indelible space pen! And prom is in like two weeks!Good evening Mr. and Mrs. Shefford. I'm...here to pick up Amy for...prom.Yeah, that that'll come off you won't have to get laser surgery or skin from your ass or anything.	Stop lyin'. It's gonna come off, right?	You pulled the paper away!	Heh-hah-hah. You drew on the wall. You drew on the wall!	Like I said: Same ol', same ol'.
Look, guys, I'm not here to overwork ya, okay? I'm not I'm not just your resident I'm your buddy, I'm your go-to guy.... I'm J.D.	I decided to take a different tack with my interns.	...What?	No sweat. You should hear what they call Dr. Michead.	The girl one just called you "Dr. Jerk"!
But it is crucial I have everyone here at 9 a.m. sharp tomorrow, okay?	Of course, my tack had its own drawbacks.	Look, guys, I'm not here to overwork ya, okay? I'm not I'm not just your resident I'm your buddy, I'm your go-to guy.... I'm J.D.	I decided to take a different tack with my interns.	...What?
Absolutely. Anyone else need to be late?	Oh, uh...is it cool if I come at 9:30?	But it is crucial I have everyone here at 9 a.m. sharp tomorrow, okay?	Of course, my tack had its own drawbacks.	Look, guys, I'm not here to overwork ya, okay? I'm not I'm not just your resident I'm your buddy, I'm your go-to guy.... I'm J.D.
S-sh I don't care, Sean!Come on, Turk!	J.D., they are.	Oh, well, Sean! Unfortunately for me, my interns aren't mammals!	They're mammals, actually.	Okay, that's it. I-I-I'm sorry, Sean, I'm a doctor, okay? I-I'm teaching humans, not dolphins, okay? So it isn't really helpful for me to know what works on fish.
I know where it all goes...!	Hey. Who wants to help me move back?	Love to!	J.D., could you walk my dog tonight while I have casual sex with your friend, Miguel?	Me!
I'd like to think so.	Think about it, man. Cox has taught you the most since you've been here, right? Do you really think he gives a damn whether you like him or not?	I know where it all goes...!	Hey. Who wants to help me move back?	Love to!
Ohh.... Cool.	I dunno. I guess I just...I don't see you as that much of a threat.	You're not pissed off? I'd be pissed off. Why aren't you pissed off?	Don't sweat it.	Sorry.
_You're_ a jerk!	You're a jerk.	...I take care of those official things that just have to get done.	You got it, Bambi.	Carla, can you check room air pulse ox on Mrs. Shipp?
Crystal!	...Long story short, there, Molly, I will always whistle at you like you're a blonde with big bombs and I'm a construction worker just released from prison. That clear?	_You're_ a jerk!	You're a jerk.	...I take care of those official things that just have to get done.
Uh, listen, while I have you here I'm applying for a fellowship, and I could really use a letter of recommendation. I was thinking that, when you wrote it, instead of using a girl's name you could refer to me as "Dr. Dorian." I think it sounds a little more professional and, frankly, each time you call me a girl's name, I die a little inside.	Super!	Crystal!	...Long story short, there, Molly, I will always whistle at you like you're a blonde with big bombs and I'm a construction worker just released from prison. That clear?	_You're_ a jerk!
I should get that tattooed on my neck.	Look, Janice, Denise, Tiffany Amber Thiiiieeeessen! Lemme go ahead and share a little something special with you that I like to call Perry's Perspective. One: If someone's standing in front of me in line at the coffee shop and they can't decide what they want in the half an hour it took to get to the register, I should be allowed to kill them. Two: I'm fairly sure if they took porn off the internet, there'd only be one website left, and it'd be called "Bring back the porn!" Three and most importantly of all: The only way to be respected as a doctor nay, respected as a man is to be an island; you are born alone, you damn sure die alone. Isn't that right, spike?The point is, and you just might want to jot this down: only the weak need help.	Uh, listen, while I have you here I'm applying for a fellowship, and I could really use a letter of recommendation. I was thinking that, when you wrote it, instead of using a girl's name you could refer to me as "Dr. Dorian."

That is diet....	Hey, J.D., is this regular? I asked you to bring me a diet.	It's never fun being the fifth wheel, especially when one of those wheels is Elliot's boyfriend. Still, I had decided to take the high road.	Hey, you're not doing it right.	What the hell, that's not funny! All he did was this
Pride's a funny thing....	Ooh! Your face is red! Like a strawbrerry!	No. It's a riddle.	You lied to me.	Right. The _other one_ is.
Oooooooh! I'm sorry, Mr. Bober! The correct answer is _peppers_. "Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled _peppers_."	Pickles.	And now, for a thousand dollars and this bag of I.V. fluid, which is guaranteed to make you feel like you're a hundred and ninety again, What did Peter Piper pick a peck of?	Pickles!	And to drink?
Huh?	NEWBIE!	Oooooooh! I'm sorry, Mr. Bober! The correct answer is _peppers_. "Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled _peppers_."	Pickles.	And now, for a thousand dollars and this bag of I.V. fluid, which is guaranteed to make you feel like you're a hundred and ninety again, What did Peter Piper pick a peck of?
Yes....	Did I just walk in on you mocking an innocent patient!?	Huh?	NEWBIE!	Oooooooh! I'm sorry, Mr. Bober! The correct answer is _peppers_. "Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled _peppers_."
I called my brother.	I'm really bummed out about Elliot. I just needed someone to talk to.	And that's when I made one of the biggest mistakes I've made in some time....	My boyfriend Sean.	What?
And with that, I had reopened the door that I had successfully closed years ago.	Yeah, boo-frickin'-hoo. Listen, I'm so glad you called. You know how Mom's getting remarried again for the seventh time? Well, this is turning into such a hassle for me....	I called my brother.	I'm really bummed out about Elliot. I just needed someone to talk to.	And that's when I made one of the biggest mistakes I've made in some time....
Wait! Dan! Hoog!	All right, buddy. I'll see you soon.Real soon.	Yes, it's killing me. So much so that I have to go, okay?	This whole Mom thing doesn't bother you?	Yes, Dan, I got your eleven messages. Now, because you're my brother, I'm gonna put this nicely: Leave me alone.
She was my girlfriend.	Yeah! How do you remember stuff like that?	Amy.	I know. But you know what? This is gonna be great. You know, this reminds me of the time I came down to see you guys when you were in med school.... Oh! And I hooked up with that slutty chick! Remember, the one with the huge cans? What was her name?	Oh, the audacity.
No.	Right.	She was my girlfriend.	Yeah! How do you remember stuff like that?	Amy.
Oh, that's great! I I guess you're only here because Mom wrecked the car?	Oh, yeah, yeah. Matter of fact, the only reason you were born is 'cause Mom bounced a check at the market.	They did?	Me neither! And you know what, J.D.? I'm worried, 'cause I think this marriage might actually stick.	This is a stimulating conversation. I can't imagine why Mom's new husband doesn't want you in the house.
Oh, thank God.Dr. Cox! You remember my brother Dan?	So, yes.	Nah, usually I'm in there by myself.	Now, I heard there's a bed in the on-call room. You ever get, uh, hot & heavy in there?	Dan wanted to come with me to work today, but I told him it would make me a little uncomfortable. He was okay with it.
Look, Dr. Cox...	Good God in heaven, Newbie, there are just so very many ways for me to say this to you: Never; not in a million years; absolutely not; no way, Jose; no chance, Lance; niet; negatory; mm-mm; nuh-uh; oh-oh; and of course my own personal favorite of all time, man falling off of a cliff "Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!..."	Uh, Dr. Cox, Dan was wondering if he could trail with us today....	Snack cake.	Uh, Dan, why don't you go get a snack cake?
I just want to say, thank you.	..."Pff."	Look, Dr. Cox...	Good God in heaven, Newbie, there are just so very many ways for me to say this to you: Never; not in a million years; absolutely not; no way, Jose; no chance, Lance; niet; negatory; mm-mm; nuh-uh; oh-oh; and of course my own personal favorite of all time, man falling off of a cliff "Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!..."	Uh, Dr. Cox, Dan was wondering if he could trail with us today....
"Nooooooooo..." Heh. "Poof." Heh.	Hold the phone. You don't want him to come with us?	I just want to say, thank you.	..."Pff."	Look, Dr. Cox...
Not to me.	But we're brothers. That counts for something, right?	You know what, Dan, once Dad left and Mom started marrying everyone that rang the doorbell, I remember someone saying how lucky I was to have an older brother. But you never came through for me once, did you. I mean, I called you for help because I'm in love with a girl who's in love with someone else, and you responded by showing up here, drinking all my Bailey's Irish Cream, and whining about Mom's new boyfriend. You are a self-involved user, Dan. And you wanna tell _me_ what kind of person to be? I tell you what, instead, why don't you just get the hell out of my life?	Well, 'cause I'm worried about you. I mean, hanging with you today and watching you work, with the gomer talk and all the attitude now, I'm not so sure I like the guy you're turning into. It's definitely not my little brother.	Why!?
Look, um, Dan...I wanna apologize for everything I said. For what it's worth, I really like having you around.	Yeah.	That way.So, you...taking off?	Well, isn't that perfect. You send your brother in to do the dirty work, huh? And with an open fly, no less!Made you look. A two-fer! Emergency Room?	Hey, Dan.
I know. I have dreams where I staple your fingers to your face.	No you don't.	Look, um, Dan...I wanna apologize for everything I said. For what it's worth, I really like having you around.	Yeah.	That way.So, you...taking off?
No....	Yep. Still, it sure is nice to be doing something you love. I wouldn't trade it. How 'bout you?	Here we go with this guy again.	Well, Mr. Pickles, welcome back.	As for me, it's enough just to love my brother, even though I know he'll never come up big for me.
Bunk with The Todd!	All the beds are taken. Scoot.	What are you doing?	Hey.	Still, I had my own problems.Even though she had a boyfriend, I was still crazy about Elliot. And, God bless her, she wasn't making it any easier.
Todd! You're having a dream! Wake up!	How are you supposed to get over someone when you have to be around them all the time?This night could not get any worse.	Oh! You wanted to keep talking?	Uh!?	Oh, hey Sean.
Me too.	If the elevator cable snapped, even if we timed it out perfectly and jumped up right before impact, we'd still be crushed to death. I wish I'd taken the stairs.	We'd still what?	We'd still die.	I guess people can surprise you.
Inner monologue? Weirdo!	Sorry, sometimes I just have this inner monologue running through my head.	Me too.	If the elevator cable snapped, even if we timed it out perfectly and jumped up right before impact, we'd still be crushed to death. I wish I'd taken the stairs.	We'd still what?
Yeah, it does. You know what we need to do? Uhh...?	Well, he's engaged, and he's getting married in two weeks...but, yeah, I think so.Unrequited love sucks, you know.	So, is there any chance of you guys getting back together?	Nooo. My sister just had a baby, so I'm doing the whole aunt thing.	Are you stalking me?
J.D.	Danni.	Yeah, it does. You know what we need to do? Uhh...?	Well, he's engaged, and he's getting married in two weeks...but, yeah, I think so.Unrequited love sucks, you know.	So, is there any chance of you guys getting back together?
Hi. Danni, we need to move on, okay? No more thinking about our exes; no more waiting for the phone to ring; no more stealing her purse just so you can return it later in the hopes that she'll be so grateful, she'll use the money recovered to buy you a drink and _maybe_ have sex with you after.	Hi!	J.D.	Danni.	Yeah, it does. You know what we need to do? Uhh...?
I stole the wrong purse. ...And, yes!	Did that work?	Hi. Danni, we need to move on, okay? No more thinking about our exes; no more waiting for the phone to ring; no more stealing her purse just so you can return it later in the hopes that she'll be so grateful, she'll use the money recovered to buy you a drink and _maybe_ have sex with you after.	Hi!	J.D.
Sir, I don't think that's true.	The point is, sometimes what's best for this hospital _is_ what's best for the patients! I know it, you know it, and guess what, Dr. Cox knows it, too. Although damned if he doesn't disagree with me just because I said it.	She's dead.	Grandma Dorian.	Grandma Dorian or Nana Hobbs? Because Nana Hobbs can be an eensy bit racist.
It'll turn up....	Thanks, J.D. I am so tense. Someone stole my purse!	Ooh, I can't. I got something really important to do.	Hey, you wanna go grab a cup of coffee?	See! That's what happens when you finally have the courage to cut the cord! Before you know it, you'll be ready for someone new to come along.
Whoa.	Thanks!	No problem!	Well, I was hoping you wouldn't mind if I cut you out of it, and used it in a collage that I'm making for Sean?	Yeah.
It's going great, Danni! In opposite world!	How's the whole moving on thing going?	Whoa.	Thanks!	No problem!
Probably not.	Well, I just wanted to say goodbye. I was gonna stick around for a few more days, but I don't really feel like that there's a reason to. ...Is there?	It's going great, Danni! In opposite world!	How's the whole moving on thing going?	Whoa.
I'm gonna miss you, too.	I'm gonna miss you.	Probably not.	Well, I just wanted to say goodbye. I was gonna stick around for a few more days, but I don't really feel like that there's a reason to. ...Is there?	It's going great, Danni! In opposite world!
Oh! That was good! No! No, I was doing the same thing!	Dude, we just met I was kidding.	I'm gonna miss you, too.	I'm gonna miss you.	Probably not.
Drive safe.	Adios.	Oh! That was good! No! No, I was doing the same thing!	Dude, we just met I was kidding.	I'm gonna miss you, too.
DANNI!?	I wasn't sure what I was hoping for. ...That somehow Danni had decided not to leave...that she'd snapped her leg in the parking lot....	I think I do.	No. Well...yes, but I am honestly trying to tell you that I don't think I was being clear with you before. In fact, I think I was being a pretty lousy teacher. Look, I think putting one in the "win" column every now and then is what gives us the juice to keep plugging along in games that we know deep down we're not gonna win. And that's why I locked in so intensely to that patient. Because opportunities, they...God, they come along so rarely in this place. And when they do, you just can't let them slip through your fingers. You cannot. You know?	Here it comes. I'm incompetent. I'm a girl. I'm a little girl. I'm a little girl with pigtails that rides a tricycle.
...All I knew was I'd missed an opportunity.	Yo.	DANNI!?	I wasn't sure what I was hoping for. ...That somehow Danni had decided not to leave...that she'd snapped her leg in the parking lot....	I think I do.
Oh! Danni! Hi! I'm sorry, sometimes I have this inner monologue running through my head.	You don't really get many second chances.	Excuse me!	Hey, J.D.	No one knew her last name, no one even remembered seeing her. I started to wonder if Danni was even real. I guess that's the thing about life. You don't really
The next date didn't start that well, either......but it got better from there.And that night, well...	Whoa! Woo! Agh!	Intense.	And...how was that?	He noticed her right away.And she noticed him noticing her.Their first date was amazing.They had so much fun together, they felt like kids again.Then it was time for their first kiss.
And then the young doctor realized he hadn't seen the beautiful girl naked in the light yet.Damn!	And then what happened?	...it was the most amazing night the young doctor ever had.	The next date didn't start that well, either......but it got better from there.And that night, well...	Whoa! Woo! Agh!
If I wasn't crazy about ya, would I be willing to do this?Doom-doom, bah, do-doom-doom, dop-bop...	Are you as into this as I am?	And then the young doctor realized he hadn't seen the beautiful girl naked in the light yet.Damn!	And then what happened?	...it was the most amazing night the young doctor ever had.
...doom-doom, dop-dop, doom	As I was doing the Naked Chicken Dance that my uncle Bart had taught me, I realized that life couldn't get much better than this.	If I wasn't crazy about ya, would I be willing to do this?Doom-doom, bah, do-doom-doom, dop-bop...	Are you as into this as I am?	And then the young doctor realized he hadn't seen the beautiful girl naked in the light yet.Damn!
My bad.It's a beautiful shot of you.	Okay! Now, just because Jordan thinks it's cute that you're violating her little sister doesn't mean that you can use my guest-room for your nerdy, G-rated sexcapades.	...doom-doom, dop-dop, doom	As I was doing the Naked Chicken Dance that my uncle Bart had taught me, I realized that life couldn't get much better than this.	If I wasn't crazy about ya, would I be willing to do this?Doom-doom, bah, do-doom-doom, dop-bop...
She's my patient!	Bottom line: We'll be bestest friends foreverest if you just keep your face out of my face. Uh-huh.Awwww.	"...waffles of mine..."	Stunning. Look, Tammy, as far as your love life goes, normally I couldn't care less who's laying your quivering body down by the fire while your lips whisper "No, no...no" but your eyes scream, "Yes. Yes. Oh, big daddy, yes!" But when you're dating Jordan's sissy-poo, it forces me to spend time with you outside of the hospital, and I just won't have that. So, hhhere's the deal: Don't want to have dinner with you. Don't want to go bowling with you. And I never, ever again want to walk into my kitchen and hear you say, "Ohh, it's waffle time! It's waffle time! Won't you have some waffles of mine?"	I always am.Ah! Ow!You know, I hit my head so hard I actually saw cartoon birds. Then I realized I was in Pediatrics and it was just the wallpaper! Ha!
You know, if you leave it on the counter for an hour, you can just drink it like a milkshake. Except, watch out if that block's not totally melted, hits you in the face!	Hey guys, how are you? I'm great! You know me, I'm up, up, up, up, up, and then some fashion nazi on the E! Network says that pear-shaped people shouldn't wear stripes, and whoosh, guess who's ear-deep in mint-chocolate chip ice cream. Meheehee.	She's my patient!	Bottom line: We'll be bestest friends foreverest if you just keep your face out of my face. Uh-huh.Awwww.	"...waffles of mine..."
Yeah, one time I got Chunky Monkey in my eye.	Oh, that'd go everywhere.	You know, if you leave it on the counter for an hour, you can just drink it like a milkshake. Except, watch out if that block's not totally melted, hits you in the face!	Hey guys, how are you? I'm great! You know me, I'm up, up, up, up, up, and then some fashion nazi on the E! Network says that pear-shaped people shouldn't wear stripes, and whoosh, guess who's ear-deep in mint-chocolate chip ice cream. Meheehee.	She's my patient!
Oh, uh, her landlord found her passed out on her floor.	What brings Ms. Tracy to us?	Yeah, one time I got Chunky Monkey in my eye.	Oh, that'd go everywhere.	You know, if you leave it on the counter for an hour, you can just drink it like a milkshake. Except, watch out if that block's not totally melted, hits you in the face!
A recent study found that doctors spend an average of fifteen seconds listening to a patient.It sounds insensitive, but the truth is it's all the time you need.	Yeah, lucky me, I couldn't pay my rent this month.	Oh, uh, her landlord found her passed out on her floor.	What brings Ms. Tracy to us?	Yeah, one time I got Chunky Monkey in my eye.
First of all, I already raised the hammer; and the only reason I didn't ring the bell is that the game is obviously rigged.	Uh-huh. I'll tell you what, how 'bout we head right on over there, and if you can raise that hammer above your head with those chicken bones you call arms, I'll let you take a free whack at my dome.	That __is__ weird....	Well, you have done it. It's Friday night, and instead of being at home, drinking whiskey through my son's sippy cup, I'm actually at a carnival with you, surrounded by piles of manure even though I've yet to see a single animal!	Oh, yeah, it's only the back-and-forthy rides that get me.
That's robot for "Goodnight.""Peace!" Heh.	I think I'll probably just go inside and wash my feet.	Oh, thank God! Do you wanna get some pineapple pizza?	Look, you shoulda told me. But I'm not gonna let things like this mess it up with the guy I'm falling in love with.	Gotta stop showing that to new girlfriends!
"Thank you"?	Last night I told you I was falling in love with you. And you know what you said?	Then what is it?	J.D., if I didn't go out with the guys my sister slept with, I wouldn't have even had a date to the prom.	Look, Danni, I know you're upset about your sister and I
No.... _Pineapple_ pizza.	You asked me if I wanted to go get pizza.	"Thank you"?	Last night I told you I was falling in love with you. And you know what you said?	Then what is it?
...Especially if you're dealing with a patient who needs emergency surgery.	Mmm, Britishy!	I guess around here, you have to be prepared for anything.	Mind your own beeswax.	No it doesn't!
That is so fabulous!	Dude, today I had to sink or swim all on my own; and guess what? A brother swam.	Wow. You must be dancing on the wind right now.	What?	Turk!
I just wanna know what kind of freak needs to spend all day pretending to be somebody else!	Let's go.	I won't, sweetie, trust me.	Danni, we should watch the movie in Turk's room, because he's gonna keep talking about the janitor, even though we begged him not to.	Yeah! It's just this whole janitor thing has thrown me for a loop.
Janitor!	Uh, listen, this is ____unit number 23. I got a possible sighting of Richard Kimball on northbound ______.Kimball!	I just wanna know what kind of freak needs to spend all day pretending to be somebody else!	Let's go.	I won't, sweetie, trust me.
That's what's up.	Okay, think about her right now.Now think about her and Sean together.Now think about her and me together.	Whatevah!	Dude, you can't _not_ think about her that way.	Can you believe her? She says I beat her to that code because I still have feelings for her. I don't even think about her that way anymore.
Yeah....	Kissing her all three times, except the third time you were a black guy?	That's what's up.	Okay, think about her right now.Now think about her and Sean together.Now think about her and me together.	Whatevah!
Unfortunately, in medicine, even if you do everything perfectly......there are still no guarantees.	Let's go, you guys! Come on!	She was amazing.	Hurry! Faster!	Watching Elliot in there, I couldn't help but be impressed.
You know what? I think you're out of ways to bother me.	Heh.	Yeah.	Did you look then?	I looked because you did the "hey idiot" thing to me, like, six months ago.
Think of a way to annoy me right now.That's what I thought.	No, you're wrong.	You know what? I think you're out of ways to bother me.	Heh.	Yeah.
Well, that's easy! Just tell her about it. Tell her everything you feel.	Fine, Newbie! Let me let me tell you a little story. It starts every day at 5 in the morning which is just about the time that you're setting your hair for work when I am awakened by a sound: Is that a cat being gutted by a fishing knife? Nooo! That's my son. He's hungry and he's got a load in his pants so big that I'm actually considering hiring a stable boy. But, I go ahead and dig in; because I do love the lad and, well gosh, you know me, I'm a giver. And I'm off to the hospital, where my cup runneth over with both quality colleagues, such as yourself, and a proverbial clown-car full of sick people. But, what the hey, my pay is about the same as guys who break rocks with other rocks and I only have to work three or four hundred hours a week, so, so far I'm a pretty happy camper! And then I head back home where I'm greeted by the faint musk of baby vomit in a house that used to smell like, well...nothing! Nothing! Nothing! I-i-in fact it used to smell like nothing at all. And all I want to do before I restart this whole glorious cycle is, you know, maybe lay on the couch and have a beer and watch some SportsCenter and, if I'm not too sweaty from the day's labors, stick my hand right down my pants, buuut apparently that's not in Jordan's definition of "pulling your weight".	-Help me, help you-	Stop it.	Dr. Cox, we've known each other for over two years.... Let me in, okay? Help me help you. Help me help you, help me help you
First of all, no one understands relationships like Billy Joel, okay? "Uptown Girl" got me through high school long story for another day. Secondly, you don't want to end up like the Randolphs back there, just not saying a word to each other, do you?You wish _we_ were more like the Randolphs, don't you?	Should I give her every reason to accept that I'm for real?	Well, that's easy! Just tell her about it. Tell her everything you feel.	Fine, Newbie! Let me let me tell you a little story. It starts every day at 5 in the morning which is just about the time that you're setting your hair for work when I am awakened by a sound: Is that a cat being gutted by a fishing knife? Nooo! That's my son. He's hungry and he's got a load in his pants so big that I'm actually considering hiring a stable boy. But, I go ahead and dig in; because I do love the lad and, well gosh, you know me, I'm a giver. And I'm off to the hospital, where my cup runneth over with both quality colleagues, such as yourself, and a proverbial clown-car full of sick people. But, what the hey, my pay is about the same as guys who break rocks with other rocks and I only have to work three or four hundred hours a week, so, so far I'm a pretty happy camper!

You don't?	Man, you know I don't do that.	So why don't you just, like, "take care of yo'self"?	I'm saying, this is torture!	Turk, it's been like eighteen hours since you had sex.
Same here.	Nah, I only did that like twice in my life.	You don't?	Man, you know I don't do that.	So why don't you just, like, "take care of yo'self"?
I gotta go to sleep, I'm tired.	If by "in my life" you mean "since I got home".If by "in my life" you mean "since dinner".	Same here.	Nah, I only did that like twice in my life.	You don't?
We gotta get that lock fixed.	Ohhhhh, my little newbie-doobie-doo! Say, that whole "telling Jordan how I feel" thing just went terrific, thank you for that. Now I need a place to crash. Where's Naomi's bedroom? Good night, roomies.	I gotta go to sleep, I'm tired.	If by "in my life" you mean "since I got home".If by "in my life" you mean "since dinner".	Same here.
Doesn't have to be.	Penis pump? That sounds awkward.	I know there are possible side-effects, but the incontinence goes away with most patients, and sexual dysfunction can be treated with anything from Viagra to a penis pump.	Go.	Look, I
I need to know three things immediately: Where was he when he said it, what inflection did he use, and had he been drinking? You know what, I don't care about the third one; sometimes when you've been drinking you're the most truthful.	No, you're missing the point	Dr. Cox said he liked me!?	How'd you get Dr. Cox to like you?	I already told her.
You know what? I'm glad he was drunk.	Okay, look, I know Carla's gonna have her little pre-wedding panic attack, and what if she has her good ol' buddy Dr. Cox there to tell her what a jackass I am, huh? Then what?	I need to know three things immediately: Where was he when he said it, what inflection did he use, and had he been drinking? You know what, I don't care about the third one; sometimes when you've been drinking you're the most truthful.	No, you're missing the point	Dr. Cox said he liked me!?
Good morning, gentlemen.	Agh! Okay, just say something innocuous.	Because I'm I'm captain of m-m-my kite-flying team? The M-m-mighty Kites?	No. Why do you always ask me that!?	Hey, Janice. Is it windy out?
How do you have the time to look so good every morning?	Hey, girlfriends!	The truth is most of them don't even bother trying. Except of course...	Good morning, gentlemen.	Agh! Okay, just say something innocuous.
Okay, you know how the, uh, couch in the living room has those high arms...?	How did you have sex with the woman you're about to break up with?	I was going to last night, but then I looked in her eyes, and I realized how rare it is to meet someone who's actually willing to have sex with me.	So, did you break up with her?	Hey!
He used to...borrow my jersey and wear it as jammies....	Well, I didn't!	I thought you meant teammates!	At soccer camp, I told you I wanted to be more than friends.	Listen, Danni.......Lisa.... Drunk girl who was friends with the girl I really wanted to hook up with.... It's not all of you. It's me.Scott Gerber?!
Come on! I always have time for you!	Eh, forget it, you're busy.	Actually, I'm kinda swamped right now, uh, let me get back to you, okay?Elliot, what's wrong?	I'm feeling really bummed. Do you have a second to talk?	I am trying to break someone's heart here, okay!?
Besides, I gotta go deal with this whole Danni thing.	Damn!	Turk, we tried playing Giant Black Guy. Remember what happened? People ran.	All right! My turn to get on top!	Hello, citizens! Welcome to Sacred Heart! Home of the world's most giant doctor! Be not afraid! I'm just like you! Except I'm giant!My tush is chafing.
Nah, that's weak. I mean, if someone doesn't care about you enough to break up with you themselves, it's like they didn't ever care about you at all.	You want me to just talk to her for you? I'll do it.	Besides, I gotta go deal with this whole Danni thing.	Damn!	Turk, we tried playing Giant Black Guy. Remember what happened? People ran.
What?	Hey, guys. Ohh! J.D., Danni's breaking up with you. Mm, darn. See ya!	Nah, that's weak. I mean, if someone doesn't care about you enough to break up with you themselves, it's like they didn't ever care about you at all.	You want me to just talk to her for you? I'll do it.	Besides, I gotta go deal with this whole Danni thing.
Not cool.	Well, why don't you just...hey! Ask her yourself!	I just wanna know why she broke up with me.	What?	Say what you want, those big round cheeks are warm in the morning....
Uh-oh.	I know it's a cliché, but ______ say that it is indeed the calm before the storm that lets you know that danger's coming.	Listen....	You're dating a guy named Danny? Is he hot?	Maybe that's why Danni wants to break up with me, she thinks I'm too smart!
Oh.... Thanks. He was due for a good grooming.	Yeah...?	Hey.After you dressed up Rowdy, did you trim the clumpy areas around his butt?	Hey.	After Dr. Cox exploded at us, so many thoughts were racing through my head: We have been slacking off lately. How did Doug get such incredible abs? And what the hell is the deal with Danni?
Just tell me why.	Look....	Oh.... Thanks. He was due for a good grooming.	Yeah...?	Hey.After you dressed up Rowdy, did you trim the clumpy areas around his butt?
What?	Your cell phone wasn't turned off.	Just tell me why.	Look....	Oh.... Thanks. He was due for a good grooming.
Actually I'm swamped, Danni. Sorry, I gotta go.	When you called me.	What?	Your cell phone wasn't turned off.	Just tell me why.
Dr. Cox? I could use a little help.	You'd think by now they'd know where I'm gonna end up.	Piss off, Mickhead.	Free help, here.	They won't leave me alone.
Yeah, if you wanna use the appearance angle to knock down my self-esteem, best to do it on a day when my hair doesn't look awesome! I know it's new wax.	Beyoncé, you could use a lot of help. But, hey, we all have to play the hand the Big Guy dealt us. You know, unless you're lucky enough to have those insanely over-hyped 'Queer Eye' guys show up at your door, but I doubt even they have the brass ones necessary to fix whatever the hell this is.	Dr. Cox? I could use a little help.	You'd think by now they'd know where I'm gonna end up.	Piss off, Mickhead.
It's okay to want a piece!I just want you to check out Mrs. Barlow's chart; I'm always second-guessing myself when it comes to interstitial lung diseases.	What is?	Yeah, if you wanna use the appearance angle to knock down my self-esteem, best to do it on a day when my hair doesn't look awesome! I know it's new wax.	Beyoncé, you could use a lot of help.

Sweat.	Have you seen these lately?	Solo-Flex...	Really big trucks...	Oh, that's fine. We were talking man talk...you know....
Well, your breath smells like chimichangas!	Your hair smells like Elliot's.	Sweat.	Have you seen these lately?	Solo-Flex...
_Unisex_.	I know.	The jar said unisex.	That's very pretty. And deeply disturbing.	Huh?
Dammit!	I know.	_Unisex_.	I know.	The jar said unisex.
I can do it!	You're gonna have a hard time keeping that up the whole month I'm here.	I know. I always talk like this.	It's not a secret.	It's just that you're...you're a doctor with pretty severe OCD.
Well you're the only one. Okay?	I _don't_ want a piece.	Loved pirates! Just like me!	What?	Was the blond hair and the earring 'cause you were in a rock band or 'cause you loved pirates?
Dr. Cox, you are not now, nor will you ever be, my mentor.	Look, Pink, for the billionth time, no, I will not go out for a beer with you. Now repeat after me: Dr. Cox, you are not now, nor will you ever be, my mentor.	Well you're the only one. Okay?	I _don't_ want a piece.	Loved pirates! Just like me!
I'm more skittish.	It's true I can't be flapped.	You are unflappable!	Okie-dokie, artichokie.	It's a great sign.
I wish a was a swashbuckling doctor. You know...like a pirate.	Yeah, you know, you're like a big squirrel.	I'm more skittish.	It's true I can't be flapped.	You are unflappable!
Dr. Casey!	and over and over and over	Dr. Casey.	You know, I couldn't have survived in medicine if I didn't embrace my OCD. And since I was compulsive anyway, you know, I I read the same text books over and over, I, uh, I went through the procedures over and over, I imagined every worst-case scenario over and over and over and over and over and over and over	I said enough!
Oh.	Dr. Kevin Casey.	Dr. Casey!	and over and over and over	Dr. Casey.
Yeah.	Thank you.	Oh.	Dr. Kevin Casey.	Dr. Casey!
It's weird, after one day it already felt like he was the type of mentor I always wished Dr. Cox would be. Still, I've gotta stay cool; I know I'm prone to hero worship.	Even though my crazy brain made me do those things, it's still the best advice I can give to any young doctor: Expect the unexpected and you will never be surprised.	Yeah.	Thank you.	Oh.
Really? 'Cause I don't feel the daaaaaaaiiiiiioooooooowwww...heh-heh-how cool is thaaaat!	Man, the surgeon in me is antsy. I need to cut somebody up.Thanks for volunteering. I'm not really that strong on the brain. I think this is the language center.	It's weird, after one day it already felt like he was the type of mentor I always wished Dr. Cox would be.

Ahhhh, perfect!Well, I don't carry anything around....	Hey, you're not one of those guys who carries around pictures of him and his attending, are you?	Yeah.... Reminds me of my first girlfriend. She was a carnie.You know, I'm always trying to get Cox to come out and get a beer with me he never does.	Nice place. It's got that that great...vomit and peanut smell.	Funnier still how the same guy could be the mentor I've always been looking for.
Totally.	Good. 'Cause you know, those those losers who've been practicing medicine for three years but are still looking for some kind of mentor to pat 'em on the back are just...pathetic, you know what I mean?	Ahhhh, perfect!Well, I don't carry anything around....	Hey, you're not one of those guys who carries around pictures of him and his attending, are you?	Yeah.... Reminds me of my first girlfriend. She was a carnie.You know, I'm always trying to get Cox to come out and get a beer with me he never does.
Sorry, sir.	Dr. Dorian! I'm far too irritable right now to pretend I don't hate you, so let's cut to the chase.If you know where all the garbage in this hospital is going, I'll give you......eight dollars.	I think when rational men are forced to face their shortcomings they all do the same thing: Blame Kevin Casey! Who gave him the right to judge me? 'Cause I sure didn't! I'll give him a piece of my mind! See how he likes it! Unfortunately no one knew where the son of a bitch was!	Okay.	Doug, get the hell outta here!
Nothing.	No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look...this is a weak moment. Nobody's supposed to see this. And, uh, mark my words, I'll clean up the soap. ...Probably several thousand times.Everyone's got their own burdens, J.D., and I'm not gonna be one of those people that dumps mine on somebody else. Now whatta you need?	I'm sorry....	I'm sorry. I just, I... Look, I spent the last few days meeting new people and...trying to get used to this place, and I'm stressed and I'm fried......and I just want to go home.... But here's the punchline: even though my last surgery was two hours ago, I can't stop washing my damn hands.AAAAAAAAGGGGGGGHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!	Later's cool too.
And get this: He calls it his "epiphany toilet"!	Ehp! Don't even think about it!	Who'm I gonna tell?	Listen, pal. I don't want you telling anybody about my epiphany toilet.	Damn him. He's right.
I mean, YEAH! Of course!	Huh?	Oh.	Will you be my best man?	Oh, my God! _Would_ I have a threesome with Turk and Carla? Well, it's certainly flattering, and I don't think they'd tell anyone....
Thank you so much!	Hell yeah, you will!	I mean, YEAH! Of course!	Huh?	Oh.
Even if you've done a procedure five thousand times, there's no guarantee you won't screw up number five thousand, one.	Barbie. Are you sure you went into his lungs? 'Cause it looks like you're blowing up his stomach.Aw, dammit, his O2 sat's dropping. Get out of the way, honey; come on.	Thanks. Thanks for coming back.	Newbie! It turns out I, uh, I do have some best man advice. Go easy on the mascara in case you cry during your toast. And if you're gonna chase after the bouquet with all of the other girls, make sure you kick off your pumps so you don't snap one of those chicken ankles of yours.	Probably.
Can I practice my toast on you?	A few more seconds, we would have been coding this guy.Barbie, as hard as it is to remember, but _air_ goes in _the lungs_.

I can feel it burning!	You better feel the burn!	I can't reach!	Put one hand on the floor!	It _is_ hot!
Well, we grew up in ...	Where I grew up, they didn't allow two men to marry.	I can feel it burning!	You better feel the burn!	I can't reach!
...There you gotta do things like test suits out...	Well, shoot, I grew up in the 'hood ...	Well, we grew up in ...	Where I grew up, they didn't allow two men to marry.	I can feel it burning!
Uh.... I'm the best man. Do you have any advice for me to give my friend?	...That's right.I'ma go change.	...There you gotta do things like test suits out...	Well, shoot, I grew up in the 'hood ...	Well, we grew up in ...
Yeah, I'll make sure and do that.	Just remind him over and over that the wedding is all about what the woman wants.	Uh.... I'm the best man. Do you have any advice for me to give my friend?	...That's right.I'ma go change.	...There you gotta do things like test suits out...
Later's no good, dude. I gotta stop by the tux shop, then I gotta finish telling my whole family that you picked me as your best man!	How 'bout later?	So I can get to my patients faster.	You're drawing lightning bolts on your Nikes.	I can't right now, Turk. I am completely swamped.
Why? Why do you have to do that?	Uh, actually, no. I got a call I have to go back to my hospital.	Cool. I'll see you tomorrow.	Yeah-heh. I have to go.	You should see us gettin' down when we try pants on together.
I know.	Well, look at it this way: Uh, I may be leaving here, but I will always be there.	Why? Why do you have to do that?	Uh, actually, no. I got a call I have to go back to my hospital.	Cool. I'll see you tomorrow.
Ha, I know.... Okay. Well, sir, it was amazing to work with you.	I am so messing with you.	I know.	Well, look at it this way: Uh, I may be leaving here, but I will always be there.	Why? Why do you have to do that?
Okay, sorry.	Thank you.And that's three seconds!	Ha, I know.... Okay. Well, sir, it was amazing to work with you.	I am so messing with you.	I know.
Watching Kevin go, I wondered how gay I looked giving that two-handed handshake. And also how weird it was that someone could just walk into your life, have such a big impact, and then vanish just like that, never to be seen again.But mostly I thought about how, in some small way, Kevin had helped every single person he met here.	Okay.	Okay, sorry.	Thank you.And that's three seconds!	Ha, I know.... Okay. Well, sir, it was amazing to work with you.
_Was_ in rehab, Elliot. Was. He'll never huff paint again.	Mickhead? No, Mickhead's in rehab.	He didn't help a lot of people, Elliot. It was just me, and Turk, and Carla, and Dr. Cox, and Doug, and Dr. Mickhead	Look, I don't wanna sound pathetic, but, he didn't even help me.	I haven't seen them.
There's Turk. I gotta go.	All right, see, with intubating....I can't seem to intubate patien	_Was_ in rehab, Elliot. Was. He'll never huff paint again.	Mickhead? No, Mickhead's in rehab.	He didn't help a lot of people, Elliot. It was just me, and Turk, and Carla, and Dr. Cox, and Doug, and Dr. Mickhead
It's always uncomfortable when two guys wanna say something each other.	The only reason I asked my brother to be best man was because I knew he couldn't come to the wedding. But now his plans have changed and he's all excited. Dude, it has to be you, you know that.	I wanna say tennis....	Which sport are we talking about?	Yeah, me too.
...Even though...God said it's supposed to be one....	You have no idea how much stress that would relieve.	Solid.You know, if it makes it easier, I guess we could be co-best men.	Dude, look, man, you're my friend and I frickin' love you; and no one's looked out for me like you have.Cool.	Look, you've been my best friend for ten years, man; I've loved you since college, and you know I'd do anything for you.
I'll help you. Nah. Okay.	Occupied!	I guess the important thing is to never stop searching.	Well done, there, Barbie. You're now exactly where you were three years ago.	But more often than not, the answers we've been looking for have been inside us all along.
Can I see that for one second?DRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!	That's perfect.	I can't!	Oh. Bloody. That's good. Now this time, try and do it with your	Thorns! Ah! Augh! Ow! Ouch! Ah!
I need to get it started first.	Not a strong moment for you, Polly.	Can I see that for one second?DRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!	That's perfect.	I can't!
I could tell what the guys were thinking.	So.... You guys my new residents?	The...reason Turk's in such a rush is because he's starting a rotation with the hospital's new attending surgeon.	Booga! Booga! Booga! Booga!Wooo! Ack!	Every time Turk's in a hurry, I'm always tempted to jump out and scare him. Well, today's the day!
How 'bout you? How you holding up?I...I know it's been kind of tough with Ben dying.Are you gonna talk ever?	You know Jordan, she is a rock.	So, uh, Jordan seems to be doing pretty well.	Right! Let's go and get drunk before pilates!	You know, down the street on the right, they'll make an appletini that'll knock your socks off.
That's a beautiful sentiment.	Let me go ahead and tee this up for you, there, Annika: We are all going to die someday. For the lucky few of us it'll be nice and fast. But for most of us it'll be just as long and slow and painful as a conversation with you.	How 'bout you? How you holding up?I...I know it's been kind of tough with Ben dying.Are you gonna talk ever?	You know Jordan, she is a rock.	So, uh, Jordan seems to be doing pretty well.
Now, if you don't want my help, then fine, I'll back off.... But only because I feel a little bit guilty.	Huh!	Well, you wouldn't see my face because it would be buried in your chest, giving you the hug you've been afraid to ask for your whole life!	Then for the last time, don't stick any part of your hairless body into my business. Trust me, there is nothing for you to gain from it. Because even if you went on a cruise to the most remote regions of the ocean and rescued my drowning, salt-soaked body in time to pump the sea water out of my lungs and bring me back from the brink of death, I would STILL be upset that the first face I saw was yours!	Actually, yes. I caught the matinee of that show; definitely not for the whole family.
Dr. Cox had nothing to do with me going to see your scary friends. I did it all on my own.	Spill.	Well, uh....	Come on!	Ack!
You remember when communications with Zordon went down and the Megazord was destroyed?	How are Power Rangers as lucky as Tabasco?	Why don't you just use Power Rangers?	Ohhh, where's my lucky Tabasco 'do-rag!?	...and then their own personal good luck rituals.
Power Rangers, hoooaaa!	How did I miss that episode? Ohh, that's right I was making love to a woman.	You remember when communications with Zordon went down and the Megazord was destroyed?	How are Power Rangers as lucky as Tabasco?	Why don't you just use Power Rangers?
Todd knows about the underwear thing?	That's what I keep telling him!	So why don't you just take off your underwear?	Question: Did he die? Answer: No, he did not. The point is, I gotta stick with whatever's hot. Like last month, it was not wearing any underwear.	Are you counting the boil you lanced yesterday?
It's your show, Debbie. Is this moment just like you always pictured?Stupid homemade dolls....It's a little bigger...?	You know, my head's probably going to melt when I say this but Kelso's idea wasn't half bad. Letting you run this place for a day would be a great educational experience. And, come on, let's face facts the training bra's got to come off eventually. So, it's your show, Debbie. Is this moment just the way you always pictured it?	Well, I'm a lefty.	Nice grab.	Uh, Dr. Kelso? That's my pen.
Good day.OW!How you like me now?	I love them!Now you gotta grab that elevator. But not without giving him his patented shoulder bump!	I don't like candy bracelets.	Oh, I-I-I'm sorry. Here I was in my own little world, talking to myself and dreaming about candy bracelets.	Hhhheeeere's the deal, Eleanor: We're gonna go ahead and get a full work-up on this guy. So, while I drop an NG tube and do a gastric lavage, why don't you go ahead and get an order on EKG with cardio biomarkers. If you need to know where those are, they're on page 37 of the Ann Taylor catalog right next to that salmon cable-knit sweater you've wanted for so long but haven't had the courage to order...'cause you're worried the weave's so thin, your nipples might just go ahead and peek their little pink selves through. Isn't that right, Dr. Cox....Dr. Cox...
Yeah, that's from the dryers.Hey! You know, the janitor's still downstairs. Why don't we just check his custodial closet?	That's the one.	No hair!	Y-nuh-uh.	Brown hair?
Gotta go.	Beat it.	So that's why he's been back in my dreams....	Just got the job, brah.	Randall?!
Call surgery. Tell 'em we're on our way.	Good.It's an aortic dissection. It's bad.	Uh...let's get him a CT angiogram stat.	Come on, come on, come on! We gotta make a decision here.	I don't get it, he wasn't showing any signs of distress!
I can't.	Look away.	Me, I don't believe in fate. I believe we have more control than we think, and that every action has a reaction. After all....The most minor event even a butterfly flapping its wings can change everything. Sometimes for the better. Even if it doesn't seem like it at first.	Lookit, it's just that aortic dissections are a doctor's worst nightmare. If you don't catch 'em early, there's about a ninety percent mortality rate. I mean, honestly, unless your patient was lucky enough to trip and fall into a CAT-scan machine, he wasn't gonna have a happy ending. Newbie, we didn't have a chance on this one.	...or even letting down someone you barely knew at all.In the end, it's the "what ifs" that hurt the most. Like, what if things had gone a little differently?
How long do ya...suppose this'll be?	Mm-hmm.I think we need a longer fresh start.	Fresh start.	You are right. We need a fresh start. Come on.	Heh. So charming. Could you be half as nice to me as you are to her?
And insignificant events can lead to significant events.Like me being late because I was in the world's longest handshake.	Probably ten minutes.Ease into it. Let's mix it up let's saw some wood. There we go. Nice. Very good.	How long do ya...suppose this'll be?	Mm-hmm.I think we need a longer fresh start.	Fresh start.
And be there for the ones you love when they don't.And most importantly, you learn to accept that some things are out of your hands.	So glad you're okay!	In the end, you learn to treasure the times when things go your way.	Rachel, clean up.	Of course, it still doesn't always work out the way you'd hope.
Yeah....	Didn't matter when we caught it, Newbie. It was just his time.	And be there for the ones you love when they don't.And most importantly, you learn to accept that some things are out of your hands.	So glad you're okay!	In the end, you learn to treasure the times when things go your way.
Ooooooh! That ass warrants the Batman sound effects loop!	I'm sayin'!	How else am I supposed to know?	You want my fiancée? Just go ahead and take her, 'cause she's been nagging the crap outta me. "Pick up your socks. Wash your dishes. Stop whispering 'booya' to J.D. in the morning after we have sex."	Latah!That means "I'll be seeing you later."
ZAP!	POW!	Ooooooh! That ass warrants the Batman sound effects loop!	I'm sayin'!	How else am I supposed to know?
Damn beads....	If you have to, go ahead. But! Then I'll know that we're not as close as I thought!	Then you won't mind if I tell Turk!	Look, I would never do anything inappropriate.	That she's a sorceress!
Hoo! That was lucky!	Me too!	...What you'd look like if you were Chinese...?	What were you thinking about?	Uncool!
Beads, keep me strong!	Dude. Surgeon.	Turk, don't you have any work to do?	Nah, it's on hold. The director dropped out.	I hear they're coming out with a 'Stuart Little 3'.
Nothing.	What?	Beads, keep me strong!	Dude. Surgeon.	Turk, don't you have any work to do?
Stop it.	Was it when my twin brother was here?	Mm.	Really?	You know, for a minute there I actually thought you had a twin brother.
No, but wait!I already got my shifts covered for the next two days! Besides, where're you gonna find somebody else? You think Lonnie, my intern, gives a rat's ass about acute thomrobotic thrombocytopenic purpura?	Ah, don't bother with that, Trish. You know, I've been getting my hair cut by my barber, Big Frank, for seventeen years now. Is it because his prices remained the same? No. Is it because I like the way his man-breasts feel gently resting on my shoulders when he does my sideburns? A little, yes. But, mainly, it's because, unlike you, he does just exactly what I tell him to do. You see, it's my way or the highway, and since you've already broken that dictum you're out!	Clever.	Things you say when you talk to your patients.	Noooo. They're the charts you wanted, plus! patient history charts from the last ten years, which yours truly stayed up all night organizing not only chronologically but by severity of condition.There's a good chance I'm gonna kill someone.
What other clown?	But the other clown has baggy pants!	Well, Brad, I'm the type of clown that likes to wear tight pants.	Why're your pants so tight? Clowns have baggy pants!	Dr. Reid couldn't be here today, children, so I'm here in her place.
Janitor!	Hello, old friend.	What other clown?	But the other clown has baggy pants!	Well, Brad, I'm the type of clown that likes to wear tight pants.
Naughty!	I switched to frontsies!	The clasp! The clasp!	What?	I can't find the clasp.
We only had two.	Position One, Two, or Three?	Naughty!	I switched to frontsies!	The clasp! The clasp!
It's a mystery how one woman can drive you crazy over and over again.While another can bring you right back down to earth.In the end, you have to trust that the perfect woman will always lead you in the right direction.	Oh, yeah. Well, I have something to show you later.	We only had two.	Position One, Two, or Three?	Naughty!
Look, Elliot, I don't want to jinx this, but, how did that just happen?	So did you ever get the guts to mail the invitations?	It's a mystery how one woman can drive you crazy over and over again.While another can bring you right back down to earth.In the end, you have to trust that the perfect woman will always lead you in the right direction.	Oh, yeah. Well, I have something to show you later.	We only had two.
Sean?	You were a clown for me. You were there when I needed you without me even having to ask.	Look, Elliot, I don't want to jinx this, but, how did that just happen?	So did you ever get the guts to mail the invitations?	It's a mystery how one woman can drive you crazy over and over again.While another can bring you right back down to earth.In the end, you have to trust that the perfect woman will always lead you in the right direction.
What should I do?	Oooooh.	About ninety seconds.	How soon after you guys hooked up?	You be.She's already back with Sean.
"Hey, Jay-Dee!"	Hey, J.D.	When you run into someone you used to date, either you find them totally annoying or enough time has passed that you've idealized everything about them.	Danni!?	Irv didn't look great, but I didn't have time to talk.
Hey, Elliot.	And there she was my lady.	Ooh! Gotta go!	Well, actually, I	Danni, wait!How've you been?
Should we just hold each other?	J.D., I can't talk right now.	Hey, Elliot.	And there she was my lady.	Ooh! Gotta go!
What's up....Attention, Sacred Heart! Everyone please gather 'round. Doctors, nurses, patients, hear ye, hear ye.Everyone should know that last night, Elliot Reid and I made passionate love for a good hour and a half. Check that! A _great_ hour and a half.When I hit it, I hit it good! That is all!	Sorry! Sorry! I couldn't find a parking spot! Heh.Hey, J.D. What's up?	Should we just hold each other?	J.D., I can't talk right now.	Hey, Elliot.
I totally understand. You know, Danni and I are getting back together, too.	Look, you and I have been down this road before and we both know where it ends.	I know. I mean, you don't want to be rusty at sex before you throw down with your real boyfriend, do ya?	Listen, J.D.... Last night was really important to me.	Peace out, Sean.
Yes! Raspy voice!	Blonde hair!	Damn! I should know this!	Danni? Danni, Danni, Danni.... What was her last name?	We are?
YAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!	It was.	Oh, my God, Danni, I am so sorry. I thought that's what you wanted.	GIVE IT TO ME!	Oh, I don't know, Danni. The real me's not really into that.
But the worst are the realizations that sneak up on you.	Listen, Serpico, I go four steps out that door to my car every day. And that's important, because if I don't beat Enid home from her thighs & buns class, I have to help her peel off her leotard. So remember this: I hired you, and I can fire you.	....and professional ones.	I hate my girlfriend.	In life, there are personal realizations....
So I guess...this is over.	For like _five seconds_!	Last night in bed, I knocked you unconscious!	Not really. I'm more into tough guys, you know?	"Enjoy" is such a strong word.... I...I'm used to it. You know, like cafeteria food, or the constant threat of terrorism.
So, you'd rather hang out with someone you don't even like than be alone?	Why?	So I guess...this is over.	For like _five seconds_!	Last night in bed, I knocked you unconscious!
Yeah, me too. I mean, come on, how many couples out there actually have fun together?	Yeah, pretty much.	So, you'd rather hang out with someone you don't even like than be alone?	Why?	So I guess...this is over.
You know I only have one set.	Oh, you seem real crushed! I mean, you jumped into bed with Danni so quick you didn't have time to change the sheets!	Ohh, I don't know! Come over my house, sleep with me, and then dump me the minute Sean shows up so I feel like a complete loser!	Do...what?	Okay, sort away, Seany-Sean-Sean!Oh, my God!How could you do this to me?
Could I ask you one?	Look, J.D., can I ask you a favor?	You know I only have one set.	Oh, you seem real crushed! I mean, you jumped into bed with Danni so quick you didn't have time to change the sheets!	Ohh, I don't know! Come over my house, sleep with me, and then dump me the minute Sean shows up so I feel like a complete loser!
Damn, I don't have one.	Sure, anything. What is it?	Could I ask you one?	Look, J.D., can I ask you a favor?	You know I only have one set.
Look, Elliot! What do you want!?	Didn't have one, did ya?	Damn, I don't have one.	Sure, anything. What is it?	Could I ask you one?
Sorry, everybody. False alarm.	J.D., listen. Did anything happen between you and Elliot while I was gone?	Good.	Hey, J.D. Can I talk to you for a sec?Look, things have been a little weird between Elliot and I since I got back.	I was so mad at Elliot I couldn't sleep last night. Also, Danni snores like a gutted wild boar. But mostly it was the Elliot thing.
In the end, it's about integrity.	Hey. Wanna go for a beer after the show?	Or whether it's a personal choice.	Come on! What are you gonna do about it?	There comes a time when every man has to make a choice. Whether it's a professional choice...
Please don't.	Do I have to look at you?	I guess.	You wanna have sex?	Guess it's just the two of us.
Yeah, 'cause they can't see.	Bats hear really well?	Because she hears like a bat.	That is weird. Why are we whispering?	Keep it.Dude, Danni did the weirdest thing last night she called out her own name during sex.
No, no, no, no, no. Bats and whales, bats and whales!	Oh, yeah, that's right, sonar. Wait a second, that's whales!	Yeah, 'cause they can't see.	Bats hear really well?	Because she hears like a bat.
Anyway, I have to break up with her.	Okay, okay, okay.	No, no, no, no, no. Bats and whales, bats and whales!	Oh, yeah, that's right, sonar. Wait a second, that's whales!	Yeah, 'cause they can't see.
Danni, I'm not sure how to do this but, uh...I just don't think we should see each other anymore.	Okay, just let her down easy.	Anyway, I have to break up with her.	Okay, okay, okay.	No, no, no, no, no. Bats and whales, bats and whales!
Aaaaaaaaagh!	Check.	See, like a bat, dude! Like a bat!	No, I don't!	You know what! I don't even care, you know why? Because I bet she's calling out my name while she's sleeping with him!
Hey, was I supposed to bring the tickets or the sandwiches?Oh, God.	We're goin' to see Michael Jordan! We're goin' to see Michael Jordan! We're goin' to see Michael Jordan! 'Cause we got good tickets! We went five hundred miles	I don't know. Remember back in college, when we had tickets to see Michael Jordan in the playoffs?	That's not true. Okay, you really need to stop saying that. The point is, I don't lose my cool.	His dad loved doughnuts.
You shaved your head for the first time after that.	OH! NO! Leave it on the floor! You leave it on the floor!	Hey, was I supposed to bring the tickets or the sandwiches?Oh, God.	We're goin' to see Michael Jordan! We're goin' to see Michael Jordan! We're goin' to see Michael Jordan! 'Cause we got good tickets! We went five hundred miles	I don't know. Remember back in college, when we had tickets to see Michael Jordan in the playoffs?
Why are you here? Hospitals don't sell cigarettes!	Wanting what you can't have.	You shaved your head for the first time after that.	OH! NO! Leave it on the floor! You leave it on the floor!	Hey, was I supposed to bring the tickets or the sandwiches?Oh, God.
Quiet time, Todd.	Man, I'd smoke her.	Why are you here? Hospitals don't sell cigarettes!	Wanting what you can't have.	You shaved your head for the first time after that.
Could be you!	Dr. Reid? They need you to check on that stabbing victim in Room 301?	Oh, no, he killed her.	They broke up?	It _is_ scary! You know, I knew this girl in college who moved in with her boyfriend? Everything changed stopped talking to each other, started fighting all the time and...you know the rest.
Nothing.	What?	Could be you!	Dr. Reid? They need you to check on that stabbing victim in Room 301?	Oh, no, he killed her.
Why are you here, Sean?	Don't do that.	Nothing.	What?	Could be you!
Are you the Soup Nazi from 'Seinfeld'?	Wait a second!	He's not a celebrity!	I don't know. I thought it'd be cool to date a celebrity.	Please, Larry!What the hell you doing with that guy?
Say the soup thing.	No.	Are you the Soup Nazi from 'Seinfeld'?	Wait a second!	He's not a celebrity!
Dammit!	No!	Say the soup thing.	No.	Are you the Soup Nazi from 'Seinfeld'?
I love you, honey. You're the smartest, handsomest, sweetest boy in the whole world. And no matter how hard you look, you will never find a woman who'll love you as much as I do.	What's your mom like?	Why would I idealize women?	Well maybe it's 'cause you idealize women and no one can live up to your standards.	Look, Danni, the reason I'm here is well, first of all I wanted to give you back your skull lighter.Secondly, you always seem to have some insight in to why I'm so messed up. I mean here I-I chase after Elliot for three years, now I don't want her!
My mom is perfect.	I know, Mommy.	I love you, honey. You're the smartest, handsomest, sweetest boy in the whole world. And no matter how hard you look, you will never find a woman who'll love you as much as I do.	What's your mom like?	Why would I idealize women?
Hm?	Look, kid, you're just confused. All you need to do is focus on the little things you love about her. Like...the way she puts out a cigarette...or how when she finishes a beer, she looks inside the can just to check if there's any left.	My mom is perfect.	I know, Mommy.	I love you, honey. You're the smartest, handsomest, sweetest boy in the whole world. And no matter how hard you look, you will never find a woman who'll love you as much as I do.
It's 5 to 9?! I gotta go!	Sweetie, it's 5 to 9, and my Denver omelet's not gonna make itself.	Hm?	Look, kid, you're just confused. All you need to do is focus on the little things you love about her. Like...the way she puts out a cigarette...or how when she finishes a beer, she looks inside the can just to check if there's any left.	My mom is perfect.
What is it again? It's like, you're out of luck in the soup department?	Oh, he is so the Soup Nazi! Trick him!	It's 5 to 9?! I gotta go!	Sweetie, it's 5 to 9, and my Denver omelet's not gonna make itself.	Hm?
Ha! Rad.Oooog! Ow!	NO SOUP FOR YOU!	What is it again? It's like, you're out of luck in the soup department?	Oh, he is so the Soup Nazi! Trick him!	It's 5 to 9?! I gotta go!
Just lying here, watching you sleep.	What are you doing?	Ha! Rad.Oooog! Ow!	NO SOUP FOR YOU!	What is it again? It's like, you're out of luck in the soup department?
No, I was I was kidding.	Is it? Is it really?	Morning!	The arrival of the janitors!	Then Elliot and I got to witness an event that many had spoken of, but none had ever seen.
Who won?	I'd stay out of his way today. He just lost the election for union president.	No, I was I was kidding.	Is it? Is it really?	Morning!
Dammit, she's perfect on paper! What the hell's wrong with me?	Or we could just go shoot rats at the dump!	And I have uncontrollable hostility towards small rodents.	Hey, let's rent 'Kangaroo Jack' tonight!	Maybe Elliot's just not the right fit for me. I mean, I'm the kinda guy who likes stupid movies.
And that's when I realized that I really liked all those things about Elliot, but I didn't love them...and I didn't love her.	Atchoo. Ahem. 'Scuse me.	I guess the Soup Nazi was right, it is the little things that are important.Or how she's the only person I know who sneezes with her eyes open.	Nothing. I just love the way you drift off in your head sometimes.	What?
Oh, boy.	You're the best.See you later.	And that's when I realized that I really liked all those things about Elliot, but I didn't love them...and I didn't love her.	Atchoo. Ahem. 'Scuse me.	I guess the Soup Nazi was right, it is the little things that are important.Or how she's the only person I know who sneezes with her eyes open.

No it's just...it's nice to hear it out loud.	Oh, should I not have said that?	Boyfriend?	God, we have so much history together. So great to finally be able to call you my boyfriend.	Yeah.
Come on, man. Elliot and I are like best friends. We love hanging out with each other. Maybe that's love. I mean, who who knows what love really is?	Cheers.You're making a big mistake.	Gimme some champagne! I need a victory sip!	Ohhhh-ho!	Oh, you know what? If it's okay with you, I'm gonna go ahead and take relationship advice from someone whose fiancee is currently speaking to him. Ohhhh!
I hope so.	I do. J.D., when I look at Carla, I see the future. I see kids, I see minivans, I see a beer gut on me, of course, not her.	Come on, man. Elliot and I are like best friends.

I know. Maybe you should stand up and say that.	Dude, I'm trying to make a point here.	Turk.	But you know what's really weird? None of that stuff scares me. Not even when	I hope so.
Listening to Turk made me think a lot about love.Like how sometimes it can be hard to understand.	Carla.When I look into your eyes, I see the future. I see kids, I see minivans...you name it, I see it. The weird thing is, though, as long as I see your smile, none of that stuff scares me.	I know. Maybe you should stand up and say that.	Dude, I'm trying to make a point here.	Turk.
Turk and I have to go.	Oh, really?Uhmm.... How how thin did you want those?	Elliot, maybe you should pay attention to what you're doing.	Uh, help this.	That looks like fun. Can I help?
Look out, Tiger!	See, Turk and I had made a pact.The day that one of us got married, we'd play a last round of tennis-ball golf in the parking lot as single best friends.	Turk and I have to go.

You can't just crash my best friend's wedding!	We RSVP'd when we were still dating.	Danni, what are you doing here?	For some reason, this woman wants you to usher her.	Holla.
Right this way, please.	I'll go halvsies on the gift.	You can't just crash my best friend's wedding!	We RSVP'd when we were still dating.	Danni, what are you doing here?

Sean, if you have any guts at all, you will show up at this wedding, take her into your...hairy arms, and tell her you want her back!You should...probably shower first.	I don't know, J.D....	I didn't steal Elliot from you, man! She just panicked 'cause you guys were moving in together!	What do you want, J.D.?	Ah.
Who's that?	No, I wasn't invited to the wedding. I just work here on weekends.	You wore your janitor uniform to a wedding?	How's it goin'?	Keep walking, dragon.Yagh!

That was awesome.	Yeah?	Remember that after-party we had in college, when the stereo went out and I ended up hooking up with that grad student from Brazil?	Okay, Carla's dying, it's rally time. We have no band, we have no DJ. You're my best man brainstorm.	I know. I know.
I thought she was kneeling.Ted! Can you play a little music for us, buddy?	Woo hoo, you made out with a little person.	That was awesome.	Yeah?	Remember that after-party we had in college, when the stereo went out and I ended up hooking up with that grad student from Brazil?
Probably not.Elliot!You let me know when we are.	What do you think?	You and I are gonna be okay, right?	J.D.! It's not happening. Besides, if Sean and I are meant to be together, I never would have gone home with you that night and sabotaged everything that I had with him.	You can't let him drive her home! She says "thank you" the naughty way!
Um...we weren't talking.	So where were we?	But I also heard she was a little spacy.	Mr. Witcomb is in the middle of a psychotic break from self-discontinuation of his meds, so we need to get him on Haloperidol IV stat.	Not only was Dr. Clock easy on the eyes, but apparently she was an excellent shrink.
No, I mean like we've never talked...ever.	Was it 'cause of something you did, 'cause I am totally over it. I don't even remember what it was.	Um...we weren't talking.	So where were we?	But I also heard she was a little spacy.

That depends, does "blalalala" mean confused and incredibly annoyed?	Sooo, ya felling all, like, blalala!	Yes, milady?	My last week of residency had begun. In seven days I'd be a full-fledged doctor. It felt pretty special to me, and I had a hunch it meant a lot to one other person as well.
Hugh Jackman's Wolverine! How dare he.	I suppose I could riff a list of things that I care as little about as our last week together. Lemme see, uhh.... Low-carb diets. Michael Moore. The Republican National Convention. Kabbalah and all Kabbalah-related products. Hi-def TV, the Bush daughters, wireless hot spots, 'The O.C.', the U.N., recycling, getting Punk'd, Danny Gans, the Latin Grammys, the real Grammys. Jeff, that Wiggle who sleeps too darn much!

Okay, you gotta take a stand on this "Johnny" thing before it becomes permanent.	Anyhoo, he likes to sing when he gets up in the morning, and the weird thing is, Johnny, he actually captures the mood of the room.	Mmm.	Drink your juice, Mr. Blass.Mr. Blass has Pick's disease, which is similar to presentation to multi-infarct dementia.	Haunting.
What's wrong with you?	You know what, it's "J.D." for "John Dorian," so so John...look, you know what, Johnny's fine, it's cool.	Okay, you gotta take a stand on this "Johnny" thing before it becomes permanent.	Anyhoo, he likes to sing when he gets up in the morning, and the weird thing is, Johnny, he actually captures the mood of the room.	Mmm.
What floor?	Anyway, Johnny, I was noticing that you were having some trouble motivating your patient back in there, and I actually published a paper on motivation methodology in post-operative seniors, so, if you want, I could help.

Okay, you gotta take a stand on this "Johnny" thing before it becomes permanent.
You know, Molly, I appreciate the offer, but there's a very special doctor I use around here when I need help, and he'd be pretty pissed if I didn't come to him first.	Oh, my god, we're on an elevator.	What floor?	Anyway, Johnny, I was noticing that you were having some trouble motivating your patient back in there, and I actually published a paper on motivation methodology in post-operative seniors, so, if you want, I could help.	What's wrong with you?
Please, you know you love it. Now, come on, one more time for nostalgia's sake: You come see my patient, you teach me a lesson, and then the music plays, right? In my head, it sounds like this: Ba-buh-buh-ba-buh-buh-buh, ba-buh-buh-ba-buh-buh-buh-buhhh.	Why, Mariska? Why do you insist on bothering _me_ with these things?	You know, Molly, I appreciate the offer, but there's a very special doctor I use around here when I need help, and he'd be pretty pissed if I didn't come to him first.	Oh, my god, we're on an elevator.	What floor?
Well, this is kinda cool! Hey, you know, maybe we could, like, be friends.	Thank you!	What can I say, it's been...horrifying.	Sounds like fun, but no. Our game is over, buddy. Your residency's coming to a close and...that's it, nothing left to do but:	Well then I'm sure I can expect an appropriate retaliatory response. Maybe you could shoot me in the neck.
I'd never tried it.	You like huntin' squirrels?	Well, this is kinda cool! Hey, you know, maybe we could, like, be friends.	Thank you!	What can I say, it's been...horrifying.
And the day just got better from there.Mostly because Mr. Radford had the same "screw you, Dr. Cox" attitude that I had.	Easiest thing in the world all you need are some walnuts...and a boxing glove!	I'd never tried it.	You like huntin' squirrels?	Well, this is kinda cool! Hey, you know, maybe we could, like, be friends.
Nnoo! You're like a crazy person!	After he said there was no hope with Mr. Radford, didn't you both work harder?	Hmm, no.	Look, isn't it possible that Dr. Cox tricked you as a motivational ploy?	I must go to one of those.
Uh, excuse me, I'm not a child. I'm a doctor.	Look, I'll tell you something else. I mean, Dr. Cox is a text-book closed-off alpha male. I mean, you can try forever, but you're never gonna get that hug that you really want.	Nnoo! You're like a crazy person!	After he said there was no hope with Mr. Radford, didn't you both work harder?	Hmm, no.
Whether it's a brand new one...	"All by myself / Don't wanna be..."Elliot	Whether or not you survive in a hospital is all about how you handle your relationships.	Good God, Fantasia. You you don't actually think I'm done teaching you, do you? D'you not understand the only difference between today and tomorrow is that you wake up tomorrow and start coming in here and killing people, that no one can say, "It's no big deal, he's just a resident." Instead, what they're damn sure gonna be wondering is who tried to educate your sorry ass. And when that finger of blame starts pointing in my direction, I had damn sure better be in a coma from the anger stroke I suffered from the last time you tried to hug me.Oh, and, uh, don't be late tomorrow...Doctor.	Ow.
...or an old one you need to figure out all over again.	"...all by myself!"Elliot	Whether it's a brand new one...	"All by myself / Don't wanna be..."Elliot	Whether or not you survive in a hospital is all about how you handle your relationships.
We're not done with our thing yet, are we.	Bull's eye!	Hooogh! Aaaaaaaaaaauuuugggghhh!Oof.	Ba-buh-buh-buh-ba-buh-buh-buhhh. Buh-buh-buh-buh-ba	As for me, it was my relationships that got me through my residency.
The weird thing is, he was right.	No. For you, it's all just beginning.	We're not done with our thing yet, are we.	Bull's eye!	Hooogh! Aaaaaaaaaaauuuugggghhh!Oof.
Dr. Molly Clock, the new attending psychiatrist. Yes, she was HOHHHT! But I wasn't a fan. For one thing, she's always calling me "Johnny." Also, she wasn't very nice.	Yeah! Bubble wrap!	It wasn't all bad.Bubble wrap! Bubble wrap! Bubble wrap!	Hold up. They made you move furniture?	Well, we didn't come straight here.Come on, Dorian. You gotta want it!
What. A. Bitch. Plus, she's _always_ with Elliot; and since I dumped her, we weren't getting along all that great.	Hey, sit with us. We'll make room, even if I have to stand.

Oh, I'll impress you!Hit the water!	Well, you could start by getting the lightbulb out of this genius's pooper. Impress me.	Let me know how to get back on top. I'll do anything, even if it means I have to kill somebody!	Well, Jo-Jo, right now she's winning.	I am a medical professional, and you are not gonna get me to compete with Elliot.
Doug! Stay positive.	I'll impress him some other way.	Oh, I'll impress you!Hit the water!	Well, you could start by getting the lightbulb out of this genius's pooper. Impress me.	Let me know how to get back on top. I'll do anything, even if it means I have to kill somebody!
Wait, so, if we're both gonna be chief residents, why didn't you just say that from the beginning?	Well, I figure with her being ridiculously book-smart to the point where she has almost no interpersonal skills, and you being warm and cuddly as an un-potty trained labradoodle and about as useful in high-stress medical situations as an un-potty trained labradoodle _together_ the two of you make one barely passable doctor...slash labradoodle.	Uh, what now?	Yeah, Scarlett? You're chief resident too.	No, no. I totally understand. Come on, you did what you had to do. You went with your gut; Elliot's a great doctor. I do have three questions, though: Why do you hate me when I show you nothing but love? Who's gonna tell my mom? And what the hell am I supposed to do with ten thousand "John Dorian, Chief Resident" business cards!?!?!
John Dorian, chief resident.It's just that Elliot and I doing this together is gonna be a little tough we're going through a bit of a rough patch.	What, and miss your hall of fame hissy? Not on your life.	Wait, so, if we're both gonna be chief residents, why didn't you just say that from the beginning?

Uh, what now?
It burns!	Whoop, that one got away.	Owwww!	Cleaning time!Don't worry, I'll go fast.	I guess the only thing to do when you're in the middle of it is to hope that nothing makes it worse.
We decided to go petty.	The way I see it, you guys can either get past it and talk like adults, or you can behave like petty children.	Of course not.	Johnny!	Great. Maybe we could make it permanent.
I'll take Doug.	Okay, instead of sharing you all, we're gonna separate you into two resident teams so that J.D. and I never have to see each other.	We decided to go petty.	The way I see it, you guys can either get past it and talk like adults, or you can behave like petty children.	Of course not.
Relax, Doug, you're the only one whose name I know.	YES! Suck on that!Thanks, J.D. First pick.	I'll take Doug.	Okay, instead of sharing you all, we're gonna separate you into two resident teams so that J.D. and I never have to see each other.	We decided to go petty.
Elliot and I weren't the only ones who decided to go petty.	Hey! I got like a two-hour break between patients, do you wanna grab lunch? Or dinner, I'm not really sure what time it is.	John Dorian, chief resident. Website's on the back.	Yeah, uh, name's Amy, actually.	Shut up, Doug!
Well, I wouldn't pay you.	You couldn't pay me to come over to your area.	Do whatever you want, just don't come over to my area.	Don't worry, I just came to check on my patients.	Unbelievable, Doug.
It just so happens I have a rich uncle who'd do anything for me, but I'd never call in that favor just to pay you to come over to my area!	Well, you don't have enough money.	Well, I wouldn't pay you.	You couldn't pay me to come over to your area.	Do whatever you want, just don't come over to my area.
We need a one milligram Epi.	Get the crash cart.	Elliot, he's in V-tach.	I hate to interrupt, but I think you need to take a look at this man.	Got her!
Ultimately, conflict is resolved by remembering why you were friends in the first place.	That's the one.	Well, I remember hiding in a supply closet.	I know.	Can you imagine us trying to do that three years ago?
No, no, I mean like, like outside coffee real world coffee.The point is, we should...hang out outside the hospital sometime.	We're having coffee.	We should go get coffee.	Me too.	I miss this. This, like, hanging out, you know?
Is it fixed now?	J.D., I still need time. I know that's gonna be hard for you because you like to fix everything right way, but...you just do the best you can, okay?	No, no, I mean like, like outside coffee real world coffee.The point is, we should...hang out outside the hospital sometime.	We're having coffee.	We should go get coffee.
Shoot!	Nope.	Is it fixed now?	J.D., I still need time. I know that's gonna be hard for you because you like to fix everything right way, but...you just do the best you can, okay?	No, no, I mean like, like outside coffee real world coffee.The point is, we should...hang out outside the hospital sometime.
What possible reason could you have for breaking your broom in half?	No. I had to do it anyway.	Oh, what, is that supposed to intimidate me or something?	Just so you know, I think this chief resident thing has made you a little too big for your britches? Soo...from now on I'm gonna be your britches shrinker.	I've never seen Dr. Cox and Jordan speechless before. It was neat-o!
Hey, you remember how I make more money than you now?	It felt good cheering Turk up. See, now that I'm chief studly, I was making a lot more money than him. Needless to say it was a time to be extra sensitive.	Wise!	Play-Doh Pants became all about the money.	Better than Play-Doh Pants?
Here's five bucks for remembering. Anyway, I was thinking about spending some of my extra ducats on one of those classy suits we always wanted!	Yeah?	Hey, you remember how I make more money than you now?	It felt good cheering Turk up. See, now that I'm chief studly, I was making a lot more money than him. Needless to say it was a time to be extra sensitive.	Wise!
You know it, dawg!	You mean the leather purple jumpsuit Eddie Murphy wore in 'Raw'?	Here's five bucks for remembering. Anyway, I was thinking about spending some of my extra ducats on one of those classy suits we always wanted!	Yeah?	Hey, you remember how I make more money than you now?
What's a question-talker?	That's cold!Look, I gotta go. I've got a new attending and he hates it when we're late. Plus he's a question-talker.	You know it, dawg!	You mean the leather purple jumpsuit Eddie Murphy wore in 'Raw'?	Here's five bucks for remembering. Anyway, I was thinking about spending some of my extra ducats on one of those classy suits we always wanted!
You can try as hard as you want, that is never gonna stick.	Just making it official.Chief. Co-Chief.	What are you doing?	Just because I lured her away from her perfect boyfriend and then dumped her doesn't mean my scooter, Sasha, needs to suffer.	Mmmm, it sends a message.
Heh.	That means a lot coming from the co-chief resident!	Well, Mrs. Covello, your CAT-scan showed a small rectal tumor, so I want to schedule a low anterior resection. But don't worry, we have an amazing surgical team here, okay?	Would Co-Chief Dorian please report to the I.C.U.? Co-Chief Dorian? Co-Chief?	Yep, there was definitely trouble in paradise.
Dammit.	How did she hear? She's been in a coma for two weeks!	Heh.	That means a lot coming from the co-chief resident!	Well, Mrs. Covello, your CAT-scan showed a small rectal tumor, so I want to schedule a low anterior resection. But don't worry, we have an amazing surgical team here, okay?
Sure.	Hey, buddy! Can I talk to you for a second?	Dammit.	How did she hear? She's been in a coma for two weeks!	Heh.
What's the Todd doing?	I know the Todd's doing her resection, but if you send her down right now, he's a little busy so it'd have to be me.	Sure.	Hey, buddy! Can I talk to you for a second?	Dammit.
Yeah?	Yeah, well, you know the city surveyor is outside taking pictures of the hospital for the zoning commission?	What's the Todd doing?	I know the Todd's doing her resection, but if you send her down right now, he's a little busy so it'd have to be me.	Sure.
Ha!	I told him they were shooting a Sacred Heart calendar.	Yeah?	Yeah, well, you know the city surveyor is outside taking pictures of the hospital for the zoning commission?	What's the Todd doing?
I don't know, Turk. It's a little early for me to start pulling strings I just got this co-chief job. Dammit, now I'm saying it!	Gentlemen! Say hello to June!How about a sneak-peek of July!	Ha!	I told him they were shooting a Sacred Heart calendar.	Yeah?
Mmmggghhh! Okay!	Come on, man, get me back in the game!	I don't know, Turk. It's a little early for me to start pulling strings I just got this co-chief job. Dammit, now I'm saying it!	Gentlemen! Say hello to June!How about a sneak-peek of July!	Ha!
You know what, here's ten bucks for letting me help you out. Spend it wisely!	O-kay!Okay!	Mmmggghhh! Okay!	Come on, man, get me back in the game!	I don't know, Turk. It's a little early for me to start pulling strings I just got this co-chief job. Dammit, now I'm saying it!
Well, that's easy, Lonnie, what you want to do	Excuse me. We're working up this patient for a hypercoagulable state with a prolonged PTT? What's our next step?	Well, as you may have heard from the loudspeaker, some residents, the janitor, my mother, your mother, and a...a coma patient, um, I'm being referred to as the "co-" chief resident. I think we should either both go with "co-chief" or "chief." Don't you...co-agree?	What about it?	Around here, there's always at least one person that'll come through for you.In Turk's case, that was me.J.D.: Hey, Elliot! Hey, I want to talk to you about this whole chief resident thing.
We're both chief residents. Isn't that right, Dr. Reid?	I'd like my answer from the chief resident.	Well, that's easy, Lonnie, what you want to do	Excuse me. We're working up this patient for a hypercoagulable state with a prolonged PTT? What's our next step?	Well, as you may have heard from the loudspeaker, some residents, the janitor, my mother, your mother, and a...a coma patient, um, I'm being referred to as the "co-" chief resident. I think we should either both go with "co-chief" or "chief." Don't you...co-agree?
Sorry.	YEAH!	What, too hot?	OWWW!	Hey, man. Look what I confiscated from one of the kids in Pediatrics.
Okay, well, look, we both might have had bad days, but I got just the thing that's gonna cheer us up.Ahhh? Dream come true, right!	Not in the mood!	Sorry.	YEAH!	What, too hot?
Oh, now I get it. You're just mad because I make more money than you.	Do you really think I want this suit?Well, I do. But not from you!	Okay, well, look, we both might have had bad days, but I got just the thing that's gonna cheer us up.Ahhh? Dream come true, right!	Not in the mood!	Sorry.
You are such a wuss!Turk, come on.Ah, these things chafe. Now I know why Eddie called it "Raw."Carla! Do you have any powder?	No, I'm mad because of that surgery today. You doubted me.	Oh, now I get it. You're just mad because I make more money than you.	Do you really think I want this suit?Well, I do. But not from you!	Okay, well, look, we both might have had bad days, but I got just the thing that's gonna cheer us up.Ahhh? Dream come true, right!
She's got fingers like biceps!	The point is it was nice being the one chief resident for a while, you know?	Okay....	Look, J.D., ever since you dumped me, everyone around here's been treating me like some kind of a victim. It's like, "Ohh, look at poor Elliot going home alone." Or, "Ohh, look at poor Elliot riding a tandem bike by herself." That's not something I normally do, I just really wanted ice cream the other night, my car was out of gas, and that's the bike the Gundersons loaned me. They do everything together....	What co-chief stuff? I haven't even been thinking about it.
Oh my God! Dude! I doubted you for a second, why are you so mad?	By not inviting you!	Cheers.So! How you guys gonna celebrate your divorce?	Helps the tears taste less bitter.	Mm-mm.Thirsty, huh?
As co-chief resident, I've noticed that some of my residents are a little overwhelmed. And I-I-I think it would be nice if you gave 'em one of your patented pep-talks, you know?	What do you want?	First of all, they were just big socks, okay? And secondly, if you need to do some laundry, here's the washboard, right?	The answer is yes, it was me who saw you doing leg lifts in the gym on that inflatable ball. It was quite the display of girl power. Absolutely loved the leg warmers!	Ooh, Dr. Cox, can I ask you something?
Say it...say it without the "Dr."	Who is Dr. de Man?	Not just someone Dr. de Man.	Someone's gonna stick a needle in my chest?	Mr. Daniels, some fluid has gathered near your heart, so I'm gonna schedule a periocardiocentesis and drain it with a needle.
No, just say the the last name.	Who's Mr. de Man?	Say it...say it without the "Dr."	Who is Dr. de Man?	Not just someone Dr. de Man.
I'm de Man!	Who's de Man?	No, just say the the last name.	Who's Mr. de Man?	Say it...say it without the "Dr."
So I'll go ahead and schedule the procedure.	All right, now that you've got his confidence, drive it home.	I'm de Man!	Who's de Man?	No, just say the the last name.
I do.Dr. Cox, I want to thank you for that "everyone's a murderer" speech. Nice scare tactic. Unfortunately, my residents have stopped eating.	If you think it's the right thing to do.	So I'll go ahead and schedule the procedure.	All right, now that you've got his confidence, drive it home.	I'm de Man!
It's strange. Even though a lot of patients have died under my care, I don't think I've killed any of them....	That wasn't a scare tactic, Portia! Eventually everyone commits a sin of omission or doesn't act quickly enough, and somebody kicks the bucket. It's really...it's really not a question of "if" it's a question of "when."	I do.Dr. Cox, I want to thank you for that "everyone's a murderer" speech. Nice scare tactic. Unfortunately, my residents have stopped eating.	If you think it's the right thing to do.	So I'll go ahead and schedule the procedure.
No flapjacks in heaven!?! Are flapjacks evil?	They don't have those.	Ooh! Maybe I'll have some flapjacks!	Get anything you want, dear.	Heaven's a diner?
This needle is too sticky! I'm out! Get it together, Laverne!	Elliot's comment didn't bother me, because I'm proud of the body God gave me.Besides, I had bigger problems. I had to do Mr. Daniels' procedure. Luckily I'm a professional, and professionals finish the job.	I have to go.	Giant Adam's apple!	"Eyebrows." Like that's gonna make youElliot, come on, you can't be that insecure.
Who?	Hey, Peggy? Yes, I noticed the turtleneck choice in August, and can only assume it's got something to do with that grapefruit you store in your trachea. Let me put your mind at ease: You've killed before.	This needle is too sticky! I'm out! Get it together, Laverne!	Elliot's comment didn't bother me, because I'm proud of the body God gave me.Besides, I had bigger problems. I had to do Mr. Daniels' procedure. Luckily I'm a professional, and professionals finish the job.	I have to go.
Whoa. Bye-bye.	Do you remember Mrs. Carter?	Who?	Hey, Peggy? Yes, I noticed the turtleneck choice in August, and can only assume it's got something to do with that grapefruit you store in your trachea. Let me put your mind at ease: You've killed before.	This needle is too sticky! I'm out! Get it together, Laverne!
She died?	Wahoooo!	Whoa. Bye-bye.	Do you remember Mrs. Carter?	Who?
The weird thing was that I was a little happy.	Three days ago of endocarditis. You didn't get blood cultures and you missed it. You happy?	She died?	Wahoooo!	Whoa. Bye-bye.
One of the hardest things around here is that sometimes you don't get to know how things end.	Come on. I know you're scared. A lot of times you feel like a little girl in a big gal's body. But here's the dirty little secret: Fear is good. It keeps you from becoming a crappy doctor. Trick is you just can't let it paralyze you. But don't you worry about a thing, there, Newbie. You're a sure thing to get a kill. In fact, should be any day now!	You know what, I don't appreciate lying.	Ooh, did I trick Newbie? I did, didn't I!	Mrs. Carter?
If only, Chauncy.Bottom line, that tape recorder won't fly away and break your heart.	Liver disease!	Sorry, that's all he can say. Anyway, you don't have liver disease you have inoperable lung cancer.	Liver disease! Liver disease!	Come on, Carla, I wanted a hook and I only had one other idea.Mr. Hawkins, the results of your tests are back, and you have
Possible nicknames for Dr. Cox when we become best friends: The Coxinator. Cox of Seagulls. Hooooooog!	Gimme this!	Sorry I'm late! I was recording some thoughts and I slipped and fell.	Wet floor.	Aaaaaaaaaaaaagh!
AAAGGGHHH!	Agh!	M'kay, I'll see you guys.AAAAGGGHHH!!!	And finally, a dose of fear.	Now, I just want you to know, you guys all have the potential to be amazing doctors.
AGH!	Agh!	AAAGGGHHH!	Agh!	M'kay, I'll see you guys.AAAAGGGHHH!!!
Carla's setting some kind of record on being a major pain the ass, and I can't help you.	The point is Carla's setting some kind of record on being a major pain in the ass, and I can't help you.	Oh. That's way cooler.	No! Not every night. On the weekends I didn't have to be in bed by 11, but I had to be in my room.	You had a bedtime when you were seventeen?
Should have seen that coming.	Can you pull off manly way?	Can you pull off contrite?	Fair enough. Later on today when you are with your residents, I'll come up for something, you'll tell me you're too busy in a manly way, and I will contritely turn around and walk out of the room with my tail between my legs. Problem solved.	You ruined my credibility! Now look me in the eyes and tell me that's not messed up!
I simply will not tolerate it, Perry! And neither will my boys!	Wrap it up, there, bingo.	You bet your ass I am.	Are you really doing this?	Oh, and another thing.From now on, I'd prefer it if you'd address me as "Dr. Dorian."
It was worth it.Lonnie, slap the face!All of you, slap your faces!Awesome.	The next minute you find yourself alone, I'm gonna kill ya.	I simply will not tolerate it, Perry! And neither will my boys!	Wrap it up, there, bingo.	You bet your ass I am.
Not in front of my boys! This is Lonnie! He's one of my boys!Not sure what that means. See you later.	Especially if that someone is a resident that can keep Dr. Cox from killing you.	Whoooagh! Ow! Lonnie! Damn you!	As I watched Elliot and Molly walk off, and thought about how Lonnie was a much less stable giant doctor base than Turk, I realized how important it is to have someone close to you that you can count on.	Hello, tiny ladies! I don't believe we've met! I'm the world's most giant doctor! Nice to
Sometimes you have to keep people closer than you'd like.	Not in front of my boys! This is Lonnie! He's one of my boys!Not sure what that means. See you later.	Especially if that someone is a resident that can keep Dr. Cox from killing you.	Whoooagh! Ow! Lonnie! Damn you!	As I watched Elliot and Molly walk off, and thought about how Lonnie was a much less stable giant doctor base than Turk, I realized how important it is to have someone close to you that you can count on.
In my case, it was best just to keep my distance.	That was too easy. No way I'm doing that seven nights a week.	Sometimes you have to keep people closer than you'd like.	Not in front of my boys! This is Lonnie! He's one of my boys!Not sure what that means. See you later.	Especially if that someone is a resident that can keep Dr. Cox from killing you.
I wonder if we're going to a happy place?	Can I have a word with you?Go.	In my case, it was best just to keep my distance.	That was too easy. No way I'm doing that seven nights a week.	Sometimes you have to keep people closer than you'd like.
Snap out of it! Abort! ABORT!	Dude! Relax... and enjoy hot chocolate love.	Dammit!	I don't know, maybe we should work on that... together.	Dammit! Molly, you're a shrink: why is it my daydreams always end right before the sexy part.
Dan, you've been in here for, like, nine hours: you okay?	No, that was Old Dan. Look at me: this is New Dan! I'm totally here for you.	Dan, I love you, but being there for people isn't really yo' thang.	Oh, it will eventually. But don't worry when it does, Big Bro' will be there.What? What is it?	I don't know... it hasn't really hit me yet.
I gotta go to work!	Ooh.	No, look, I put a six-pack for you in the toilet.	Yeah, today doesn't look good by the way, could you get me another beer?	You think you'll get out of the tub today?
Hey.	Hey.	... although sometimes, it's a little awkward, even with an old friend.	Walk tall, kiddo.	Even though I deal with death every time I walk into this place, I never dealt with it from this side before. It's full of surprises, whether it's a small gesture from a co-worker...... or a big gesture from someone you've never even met before.
Yeah.	I just wanted to...	Hey.	Hey.	... although sometimes, it's a little awkward, even with an old friend.
Thanks.	Look...	Yeah.	I just wanted to...	Hey.
'Kay.	'Kay.	Thanks.	Look...	Yeah.
When someone shoves you like this?	Because whenever anyone shoves me more than twice, my mind goes blank and all I see is this white-hot flash of fury.	Oh, really, why not?	Newbie, don't shove me.	You know what, I am sick of getting dumped on, and I am sick of you!
That sucks. Carla is aware that if you eat that your foot will fall off, right?	Yeah.	Really?	I... have type II diabetes.	What's the occasion?
Oh my God, just this second I was thinking your diabetes is gonna get in the way of my dad dying. Isn't that funny?	I feel like your dad dying has stolen my diabetes thunder.	You can tell me anything.	I'm not sure. Can I tell you something weird, though?	Why haven't you told her?
Very impressive, but I'm sorry.	They've been all over me.	I'm sorry, sugar, this store is closed.	Can I buy you a drink?	Oh, hellooo. Women are checking me out lately. Was it the ten push-ups I've been cranking out every other Sunday? Perhaps. More likely it was the pledge I made not to date anyone until Elliot did. See, since then, the gals have been all over me.
Our dad.	Great, 'cause it's been going on for a few weeks. Elliot's amazing! Smart, funny...hhhot. I was in a dark place and she saved me, she really did. Haven't felt this good since my dad died.	I'm okay with it.	J.D., let me explain. I came to the hospital to see you, and then I ran into Elliot and it just happened. It was a one-time thing.	Listen, Dan
Well how would you feel if I hooked up with one of your siblings?	J.D., are you really this upset?	GUYS! THERE ARE SICK PEOPLE TRYING TO SLEEP!	Okie-dokie.	Look, when I caught you two yesterday, I didn't know what to say. But now I do. You really hurt me.
Barry?	A little confused considering I have four brothers. But not surprised. At you or Barry.	Well how would you feel if I hooked up with one of your siblings?	J.D., are you really this upset?	GUYS! THERE ARE SICK PEOPLE TRYING TO SLEEP!
Well obviously you did, or you woulda told me about it from the beginning.	I guess I just didn't think I was doing anything wrong.	Barry?	A little confused considering I have four brothers. But not surprised. At you or Barry.	Well how would you feel if I hooked up with one of your siblings?
...Except my brother.	Elliot dumped me.	AAAAGGGHHH! What are you doing back in the tub!?	Hey, little brother.	Of course, in my plan nobody gets hurt.
Dan?	Look at all this stuff I bought. Candles. Champagne. A Dido CD.	Dido?	Dido. And you've really got to meet my brother Barry.	I love champagne. You mind if I have a little? Thank you. A nipper!Ahh! Tingly! It's a tingly drink! Oooooh! Pretty candles! Anyhoo, I know you broke up with Dan because you thought I was upset, but in reality, I...uh...I... "I want to thank you! For giving me the best day of my life..." I love this song, who is it?
AAGGHH!	Hey, little brother!	Dan?	Look at all this stuff I bought. Candles. Champagne. A Dido CD.	Dido?
If my heart could write songs, they'd sound like these.	Hey! I can't find my Dido CD!	That's when I realized that Elliot and I had absolutely no romantic feeling for each other anymore.No matter what the situation.It was a little sad, but, who knows? Maybe it meant we could be friends again.	I don't know I I just didn't.	I don't know. I just...wasn't.
Can I buy you a drink?	The good news was this Elliot and Dan thing meant that I was back on the market!	What was that for?	'Night, J.D.	And for Elliot and I...turns out all we needed was a little time.
Yep! I'm back, baby!	No thanks.	Can I buy you a drink?	The good news was this Elliot and Dan thing meant that I was back on the market!	What was that for?
So's your face.	J.D.	You know, Elliot, since I broke your heart, I've held my tongue every time you've been a wiseacre. But now that you slept with my brother, we're even. So if you bring sarcasm my way, baby, prepare to be stung!	Oh, yeah. You know Mrs. Wilson back there? She made her spleen pretend to rupture, and then she pretended to die.Got me again, there, Mrs. Wilson!	You ever get the feeling our patients pretend to be sicker when we're around?
"So's your face" always makes sense.	That doesn't even make any sense.	So's your face.	J.D.	You know, Elliot, since I broke your heart, I've held my tongue every time you've been a wiseacre. But now that you slept with my brother, we're even. So if you bring sarcasm my way, baby, prepare to be stung!
So's your face! I'm on fire! Helloooo!	J.D., that's stupid.	"So's your face" always makes sense.	That doesn't even make any sense.	So's your face.
And that's how Molly and I ended up alone on the couch, watching that unbelievably romantic scene from '16 Candles'.No, not that one! This one.	'Night.	Eventually things wound down. Some people went home....Some just went to bed....	Sorry I'm late. Player had a date. Anybody want some chocolate?	After the fire marshal closed down the bar, we took the party back to our place.
God bless Molly Ringwald. And this Molly. Ah, the hell with it! God bless Mollys everywhere!	Happy birthday, Samantha.	And that's how Molly and I ended up alone on the couch, watching that unbelievably romantic scene from '16 Candles'.No, not that one! This one.	'Night.	Eventually things wound down. Some people went home....Some just went to bed....
That doesn't even make any sense!	No.	Just tell me who!	You just need to clear it with one person first.	No. But you won't know until after.
Dammit! Walked into that one!	So's your face!	That doesn't even make any sense!	No.	Just tell me who!
I agree, but my legs are cramping!	I can't run in these jeans, they're too constricting!Yeah, this is much better!	He took it.I can't run in this gown, it's too loose!	You got your phone?	I was treed by that coyote!
I was kneeling on a nest!	You spent too much time crouching in that tree, didn't you!	I agree, but my legs are cramping!	I can't run in these jeans, they're too constricting!Yeah, this is much better!	He took it.I can't run in this gown, it's too loose!
You're right. Gimme that gown!	Or is it the greatest moment of your life?	Oh my God. I'll never get down there before she leaves! This is the worst moment of my life.	Dude, she's outside. She's about to get in the cab!	Sorry, wrong apartment.Konichiwa.
Hey, this isn't that scary. Uh-oh!	Go get her, buddy!	You're right. Gimme that gown!	Or is it the greatest moment of your life?	Oh my God. I'll never get down there before she leaves! This is the worst moment of my life.

Fine. Turk, tell her our code.	Girls! I want an explanation.	Oh, I hope it was summer. I'm not that big a skier.	One time we went to Aspen.	Where do we go?
Okay, fine, why don't you just tell me how this ends?	Yet another strong moment for you?	First of all, thank you. Secondly, I tried to be reasonable. Now if	No it's not. In fact, I find myself oddly turned on by your timid	Neena, it's over.

I'm free?	Okay. Fine, it's over.	Yeah!	Ouch.	And just like that we all knew who had won.
I can't wait to chronicle this one! Oh God!	Well, you seem like the kind of sensitive young buck that likes to chronicle his feelings.	Oh, my God, a journal!	Hey, I bought you a present.	Time to go see my favorite patient, Mr. Gregory Marks. He may need a new kidney, but he sure as hell doesn't need a new heart.
I'm so sorry.	Please don't be a match! Please don't be a match! Blood type O! Not a match! Yes!! Yes!! Yes!! Yes!!	Awesome. Well...let me check your chart and s-see if we're a match!	Oh, no, I would definitely take it! I would take it with my bare hands.	I gotta tell you, Mr. Marks even though I know you'd never take it, I'd give you one of my kidneys in a second.
Eventually someone's gonna miss me, Jerry!	Come on, if the guy didn't tell you about his son, I'm sure he had a pretty good reason. You know, you always do this you get too involved in your patients' lives. And just exactly how does that usually work out for ya?	Ah, that's a horse with a sword on his head, and he's there to guard my hopes and dreams.	Look, Newbie, there are times a man wants to keep something to himself. Like, say, he's got a son. Or he's 29-years-old and keeps a journal with a unicorn drawn on the cover?	Anyway, know Mr. Marks? He said he doesn't have any family to be a kidney donor? But he's got a son! We gotta find this guy!
Murray!	MURRAY!Everything my father's ever done was designed to humiliate me.	Oh, come on, no it isn't!	Well, for starters, he named me "Murray." That's an old man's name!	All right, we what's the problem with your dad?
No, the youngest Murray!	What.	Murray!	MURRAY!Everything my father's ever done was designed to humiliate me.	Oh, come on, no it isn't!
No, I'm serious.	Good stuff!	He's dead.	Look, you obviously have some issues with your own father that you're projecting on to me. So why don't you go ahead and give him a jingle?	Look, Murray, it doesn't matter that your father's handsome and charismatic and sings like a young Joan Baez. He's your flesh and blood, and you gotta step up.
He had like a massive heart attack.	Classic!	No, I'm serious.	Good stuff!	He's dead.
Now, about the kidney....	I'm sorry for your loss.	He had like a massive heart attack.	Classic!	No, I'm serious.
Make the "flesh and blood" argument again but in a different way.	I wish I could fly my plane right now. I always like to fly it when I have to make a big decision.	Now, about the kidney....	I'm sorry for your loss.	He had like a massive heart attack.
One for the road, Glen?Thanks! Happy weekend!	Yawning, Glen!	Jackpot!	I'll do it!	Blood and flesh, Murray.
Dammit!	By the by? This moment is so great, I'd cheat on that other moment from before, marry this one and raise a family of tiny little moments.	Oh, no.	Hey, Newbie! The good news is that Murray and his dad are a match, kidney-wise. The better news is that the test revealed a little secret you're gonna wanna share with your new pal. Gregory is not Murray's biological father!	"I told you so" moments are rare. So when they come, you have to savor them.
Not you, Old Murray!	Whaaat?	Murray!	I'm outta here!	Well, Dr. Kels Well, Dr. Kelso, I'm just gonna tell him. Murray's got a good heart, and he'll do the right thing.
What an odd sized explosion.	Hey...!Ohh, ohh! I'm a doctor! I'm a doctor! Everything can't get to me!	You've been great as usual.There you are! Hi, buddy!	You got the number from Jordan, didn't you. She hates me.	Fine! Maybe I got too involved like you said. But would it kill you for once to acknowledge that my heart is in the right place instead of spending all your time berating me?
Yes! I mean, yes.	Massive heart attack!	Remember? Recently deceased dad?	Why do you keep talking about your boss like he's your father?	Sometimes Dr. Cox is all over me, like every second of my life.
If Murray could look past his dad's imperfections and appreciate all the time he'd given him, maybe I owe Dr. Cox a thank-you for the same thing.	Heeey, sweet baby! Dooon'cha think maybe...	...Maybe I got too involved with Murray and his fake real dad. But as I watched Gregory serenade a clearly uncomfortable Murray, I realized something.	Hey, good lookin'! Whaa'cha got cookin'...	As for me...
Buckle up, buddy!	Oh, don't worry. I gotcha.	Like a bear to honey.	You didn't go to the black family yelling at the movie screen stereotype, did you?	Shhhh!
Hey, kids, I'm Dr. Dorian. I'm sure you have lots of questions, so let's get started.So, basically it's a topical application consisting of equal parts triethanolamine and phenyl dimethicone. I suggest applying it twice a day for extra hold. Okay? Here's a sample tube, Reuben. Excellent query.Okay, then, anybody else?	Hell yeah!	Buckle up, buddy!	Oh, don't worry. I gotcha.	Like a bear to honey.
I-I'd say my best moment was probably my second year, New Year's Eve. A young pregnant woman could barely make it into the hospital, she had her baby right there on the ramp.	What was your best moment in medicine?	Hey, kids, I'm Dr. Dorian. I'm sure you have lots of questions, so let's get started.So, basically it's a topical application consisting of equal parts triethanolamine and phenyl dimethicone. I suggest applying it twice a day for extra hold. Okay? Here's a sample tube, Reuben. Excellent query.Okay, then, anybody else?	Hell yeah!	Buckle up, buddy!
There are other ways you can get it.Dr. Cox.	Don't you get that from kissing?	It's a waffle cone.	Thanks.	Sure....
I did feel it. And I knew what Carla was gonna say before she said it.	Oh, for God's sakes, Newbie, take a look around, would you please? What's the difference between your Mr. Milligan and every other patient in this I.C.U.? And if the answer to that question is that he's the only one young enough to have never made a phone call like this: "Brring! Hello? Operator? Give me ," then you'd be right. But since I'm not in the mood to make some big, dramatic, sweeping statement, I'll just tell you this: God hates doctors, He truly does. You see all these old people in here? Well, any of 'em would give just about anything to be able to sashay off this planet, but most of 'em are gonna stay and they're gonna live forever and ever and ever. And your Mr. Milligan, well, it turns out he's just young enough to die. I mean, think about it: It's the holidays, there's a sweet little kid involved. Can't you just feel it?	Mr. Milligan? His blood pressure's a little low; he just has mono.	Newbie! You never promise a patient that they're gonna be fine!	Agh!That's one more point for Mrs. Cross. But let's see how she enjoys her beloved hard candy without ... her choppers!
You gotta be kidding me.	Kelso said, no insurance, you gotta stabilize the guy and then bounce him.	I'm sorry, what?	I gave that kid some money and sent him outside the hospital, and now I can't find him.	Why does it seem like every time I take a stand, everything turns to crap?
Why are you sick?	I'll tell you what, in about ten more minutes none of this is gonna matter, because this guy's circling the drain.	You gotta be kidding me.	Kelso said, no insurance, you gotta stabilize the guy and then bounce him.	I'm sorry, what?
So?	That's the room where the family gets to observe.	Come on, it turns out Mr. Milligan has a ruptured spleen. We're prepping him for surgery in room C.	I got gummed.	What the hell are you doing?
So you think you're a robot mechanic?	So, dude, you don't understand. When I operate, I don't see a person, I see a machine with parts that need to be replaced and circuits that need to be rewired.	So?	That's the room where the family gets to observe.	Come on, it turns out Mr. Milligan has a ruptured spleen. We're prepping him for surgery in room C.
Well, I wouldn't worry about that. Mr. Milligan only has a son and Elliot lost him.	As a surgeon, the more detached I am, the more focused I am. And it's pretty impossible to feel focused or detached when this guy's family's watching every move I make.	So you think you're a robot mechanic?	So, dude, you don't understand. When I operate, I don't see a person, I see a machine with parts that need to be replaced and circuits that need to be rewired.	So?
Ah.	Awesome! For me.	Well, I wouldn't worry about that. Mr. Milligan only has a son and Elliot lost him.	As a surgeon, the more detached I am, the more focused I am. And it's pretty impossible to feel focused or detached when this guy's family's watching every move I make.	So you think you're a robot mechanic?
It's amazing how one patient can affect so many people.	No. No, you got it.	All right, you guys, we still got a lot of work to do. Turk, why don't you go check the post-op films in radiology; and Carla will transfuse back to a hemoglobin ten; and Elliot, why don't you take Tyler and go get us all ice cream immediately.I'm gonna go check on him. You wanna come?	Who's the man!	None of us wanted to say what we were thinking: How vulnerable we felt. So we all just stood around, pretending to work, and waited for someone to come through that door and tell us how this was gonna end.
My best moment...? Well, there was this guy...	Dr. Dorian? What was your best moment in medicine?	It's amazing how one patient can affect so many people.	No. No, you got it.	All right, you guys, we still got a lot of work to do. Turk, why don't you go check the post-op films in radiology; and Carla will transfuse back to a hemoglobin ten; and Elliot, why don't you take Tyler and go get us all ice cream immediately.I'm gonna go check on him. You wanna come?
Yep, not even Dr. Cox could faze us. Because we had every facet of this job down.We figured out a fair way to schedule all the interns' shifts....	Please!	Cream?	You two are, without a doubt, the worst co-chief residents of all time. And in case you haven't noticed, we've got ourselves one hospital chock-full of monkey interns; and, news-flash, your job is to catch whatever they're flinging. Coffee talk, ladies, is now officially over. Get your asses to work. Now.	Bottom line together, Elliot and I are the greatest co-chief residents of all time.
We got this.	rock that you have been calling your skull?!	sake, Brent! When are you gonna wake up and use that	Look, Brent, is it? Son, please tell me you come with a money back guarantee, because I'd like to get something useful like a can of Brent remover! I mean, for God's sa	We knew how to protect the interns from Dr. Kelso.
He's gone. He's gone.	I mean, even a blind squirrel occasionally finds a nut! And	We got this.	rock that you have been calling your skull?!	sake, Brent! When are you gonna wake up and use that
Still, it's not like we didn't keep the interns on their toes.	Heh, look, Brent, you are doing fine.	He's gone. He's gone.	I mean, even a blind squirrel occasionally finds a nut! And	We got this.
Toto!T-O-T-O Toto.	14 Across: Four letters, "Band that sang 'Roseanna'"?	I honestly didn't understand how she could do so many things at once.	J.D., I've got your back. Laverne, bolus with amiodarone, get me the crash cart, grab me a central line kit, I'll bag him. Run the fluids wide open.	I call these "train wreck codes," and they're not my forte.
See, my problem is that I've just never been much of a multi-tasker. For instance, I can't eat and watch T.V. Or drive my scooter and answer my phone.	Okay, he's stable.

Yeah, I got this.	Oh, you know what, J.D.? Um, I've gotta run. Are you okay here?	Now, let's apply the same thing to Mrs. Kasuba. We know this isn't the first time she's experienced abdominal pain. What else do we know about her?	Wow.	It's the classic Todd Thong Sugar Trap.
Don't feel weird because you're threatened by my gift. Many are.	Say, that was some real Nancy Drew stuff, there...Nancy. I mean, absolutely irrelevant as far as medicine goes, but damn amusing!

She what?	Dr. Reid already ordered that.	There it is. Laverne, I'm gonna need you to get Mrs. Kasuba started on IV dextrose and hemotin.	"Dr. Cox at my door, pager 324."	Acute intermittent porphyria! I figured it out! All right, who's got Dr. Cox's pager number?Oh, who'm I kidding, I've got my Perry's Pager Song.
She figured it out before me.	Um, you know what, J.D., I've gotta run. Are you okay here?	She what?	Dr. Reid already ordered that.	There it is. Laverne, I'm gonna need you to get Mrs. Kasuba started on IV dextrose and hemotin.

But even that's not as bad as it can get.	Stupid Janitor. Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid.	Or realizing you've just done the most embarrassing thing in your life.	He has diabetes.	Whether it's catching a glimpse of what the future might hold....
Those aren't real guns.	You're finally at that stage where you and your equally undistinguished colleagues have all had enough training to be able to help each other. So no matter how humiliating it may seem, if you know somebody who's better than you and I'm bettin' that you do? you had best tuck that ridiculously feminine tail of yours between your legs and go ask her for help. I'm thinkin' that's just about it. Yep. I, uh, gosh, I'm all out of speeches. I don't think I have, uh, another one on me. I...I don't. The Oh. These are...my goodbye guns.	Eh! As soon as I step foot in this hospital, I'm all business.Good morning, Dr. Cox! From the world's most giant doctor!Well, that was outside the hospital. Plus, Elliot was the legs. Sure, she's skinny, but she's thick through the trunk.	Probably during one of those countless times you were goofing off?	I don't get it. When did she become a better doctor than me?
That's your big secret? Breathing?	You wanna know what my big secret is? Just take one big breath. Everything will slow down and you can just tackle each thing as it comes.	I just, I don't know what to do when everything goes wrong at once. It's it's it's overwhelming.	Just call first from now on!	And how come when we walked in you were sitting in a circle with three corpses playing Texas hold 'em?
It's just that you're a little smug.	Why do you have such a problem with me teaching you stuff?	That's your big secret? Breathing?	You wanna know what my big secret is? Just take one big breath. Everything will slow down and you can just tackle each thing as it comes.	I just, I don't know what to do when everything goes wrong at once. It's it's it's overwhelming.
Because you're the one that's supposed to struggle not me.	You called yourself Dr. Diagnosis and made me your side-kick. J.D., you've been the golden boy around here for the past three years while I have cried in closets and hid from Dr. Cox and relied on you every single day to get me through it. I mean, now that I am finally doing well enough to pay you back, maybe you can tell me why you're being such an unbelievable jerk?	It's just that you're a little smug.	Why do you have such a problem with me teaching you stuff?	That's your big secret? Breathing?
Little help? Little help!	Oh!	Greetings! Ha ha! Ha ha! I'm the world's most, most giant doctor! Whoa!	I need you to place an IV on the second floor, room 208.	Oh, Elliot, that's impossible. I mean, I know you've got strong legs, and you're
Yeah, sure. Not that kind of help. Agh.If I let go, will you guys catch me?Well, I'm going for it anyway!Lonnie? Lonnie!	Sure, sure, sure.	Little help? Little help!	Oh!	Greetings! Ha ha! Ha ha! I'm the world's most, most giant doctor! Whoa!

Long story short, I hung out with this tribe; when the males go through adolescence, they get this tattoo. It means "alias."	Ohh, no, man, we're just living together. And not like, like, livin' together, I mean, like, liiiivin' together!

Elliot!	Dude.	"You'll be surprised what'll fall in your lap if you open up and embrace life..."	Go travelin' to Texas, you know? Go line dancing with some married women that wish they weren't married. You never know what life would put in your lap when you open your arms and embrace it!	Done it! Done that. That one I've done.
That happened very quickly.	He said my eyes look like the Irish countryside after a soft rain. Ahem. I should go.	Elliot!	Dude.	"You'll be surprised what'll fall in your lap if you open up and embrace life..."
Dude.	Don't even sweat it. It's Elliot. She's desperate!	That happened very quickly.	He said my eyes look like the Irish countryside after a soft rain. Ahem. I should go.	Elliot!
No! This is a decision we both need to make! Together! As a team, as a unit!	Are you trying to convince me to do something that you already did? 'Cause you know that drives me crazy!	He put a guy in the hospital; that's a felony. And as doctors we're supposed to report him.	I don't know, man, he seems cool.	No, dude, forget them. We have to deal with Billy.

Thank God.	All right, fine, let's call the cops.	No! This is a decision we both need to make! Together! As a team, as a unit!	Are you trying to convince me to do something that you already did?

I know, but how often do we do this?	Buddy, it is almost one o'clock in the morning, and we have to be at work at five.	For Turk and I, it was important just to get out and start living life, period.	I almost peed!	Or renewing your friendships.
Uh, no. Go fish, please.Do you have any Ks?	You're absolutely right, come on.Do you have any twos?	I know, but how often do we do this?	Buddy, it is almost one o'clock in the morning, and we have to be at work at five.	For Turk and I, it was important just to get out and start living life, period.
In Turk's defense, we had tried this once before.	Promise me you'll be cool.	No, Carla, an African-American club.	Settle down, we're just going to a nightclub.	You guys, I am so excited about tonight.
And once before that.	You can't touch me.	In Turk's defense, we had tried this once before.	Promise me you'll be cool.	No, Carla, an African-American club.
But, hey, third time's the charm.	Yeeeeeaaaaah, booooooy!Man, it's only ten o'clock.	And once before that.	You can't touch me.	In Turk's defense, we had tried this once before.
Word.	All right, you three can go in.	But, hey, third time's the charm.	Yeeeeeaaaaah, booooooy!Man, it's only ten o'clock.	And once before that.
You got it! Come by Sacred Heart tomorrow, I have clinic hours. After all, I'm a doctor.	...so it's probably nothing big, but I'm wondering if you could check it out?	My God, look at those beautiful eyes. They're so big I can see myself in them. Wow, how cute am I!	This is so weird! I been looking for a doctor! See...	I'm a doctor. Uh, John Dorian. Most of my patients live.
I gotta thank you for taking a special interest in this.	Dude, I can't believe this. You're gonna date a patient! I hope she has something that keeps her here for a while so you can get to know her.	You got it! Come by Sacred Heart tomorrow, I have clinic hours. After all, I'm a doctor.	...so it's probably nothing big, but I'm wondering if you could check it out?

Okay. In there, I'll see you.Oh man, I can't believe it's over.	...so, I'll see you in there.	My God, look at those beautiful eyes. They're so bi You're doing it again!	Remember, I said...	Ohh. How could I not have heard that?
...So the moth says..."That's a good question. What kind of dentist are you?" And the dentist says, "Well, I'm a general dentist, but I...I do dabble in orthodontry braces and such." And...and the moth says, "Orthodontry? I hear there's great money in that."	Oh, no, I forgot the punchline.... You can't bail out now! Stall! Stall!	That moth is crazy!Hey, I heard a great joke. A guy walks into a dentist's office and says, "I think I'm a moth." And the dentist says, "Well, if you think you're a moth, why are you at a dentist's office?"	Dude? A guy walks into a dentist's office and says, "I think I'm a moth." The dentist then says, "Well, if you think you're a moth, why'd you come to the dentist's office?" The guy then says, "Well, the light was on."	I got this: Baby, you know you're his world!
"But! To answer your original question, which was, if I think I'm a moth, why am I in a dentist's office? The answer is, Because the light was on!"The light! The light, James. Moths love light.	"The light was on"!	...So the moth says..."That's a good question. What kind of dentist are you?" And the dentist says, "Well, I'm a general dentist, but I...I do dabble in orthodontry braces and such." And...and the moth says, "Orthodontry? I hear there's great money in that."

Window! Window!	We don't live together.	Do you ever have any, uh, shortness of breath? For instance when you're walking Kylie to the apartment that you share?	Time to go fishing for some info.	Okay, well, uh, let's get a little history on you.
All right!	You say, "Hell yeah!"	Uh-huh?	Dude, the only difference between a black girl and a white girl is that when a black girl asks you if her ass looks big?	They're okay. Is there some special way to get a black girl to like you?
Hell, yes!	Okay! You wanna play some ball?	All right!	You say, "Hell yeah!"	Uh-huh?
I love politics! Ask me anything!	I'm getting my Masters in political science.	Mm.	I just work at the club to pay for grad school.	You can bartend online?
Signs be damned! I'm telling her!	Mr. Chang is crashing!	Sometimes you have to break the rules. And Elliot's patient waking up was a clear sign that you couldn't deny.	He sure did. And you know why? Because I broke the rules and ignored what Dr. Kelso wanted me to do.	Well, he woke up to a world of bad boyfriends, oaths, and gonorrhea.
And there it was. Great doctors don't break oaths.	I wanted to thank you for being such a great doctor.	This is your moment! Grab it!	Hey! J.D.!	Hey, Kylie, there you are.
Someone once said the bad guys always win. Sometimes the bad guy is a jerk boyfriend.	Thanks again. For everything.	And there it was. Great doctors don't break oaths.	I wanted to thank you for being such a great doctor.	This is your moment! Grab it!
Sometimes the bad guy is the man you've been battling with for as long as you can remember.	It's finally here! The long-awaited showdown between Shaq and Kobe!	Someone once said the bad guys always win. Sometimes the bad guy is a jerk boyfriend.	Thanks again. For everything.	And there it was. Great doctors don't break oaths.
Your boyfriend is a jerk.	You could tell me now.	Gonorrhea! I mean...gonorrhea.	My girlfriend Tamyra, from the club? She's also feeling a little sick, and you'll never guess what she has.	What are you doing here?
It was Sophie's Choice. Either heartlessly leave the possum there to die or wrap that little guy up in my sports coat and reveal the short-sleeved nerd jersey that lurked beneath.	It's a poor little possum! We should take him to the vet!	What the hell was that?	Don't beat yourself up. I got a scrunchie.There!	It'll be awesome.Sorry about your hair.
Great!	No, no no no. It's just a box.A...talking box.I think your shirt stopped the bleeding.	I'll always remember him. Little Carlton.Anyway, we only lost about a half hour. We can still make that reservation!Oh, there's possums everywhere!	I think it's so sweet that you're depressed about that poor little possum.	A hundred and twenty dollars for a stupid dead rat!?
Aggghhh! I just said "slaves" to my new black girlfriend!	No, Lonnie.It's so great, because the residents are practically our slaves.	Good lord! That's a one-day mustache?	Are you doing this because I forgot to shave this morning?	Thanks for the shirt, Lonnie.
Well, let's see. "Fatigue, fever, malaise." Have you been to Hong Kong, sir?	Unfreeze, J.D. It's over.	Aggghhh! I just said "slaves" to my new black girlfriend!	No, Lonnie.It's so great, because the residents are practically our slaves.	Good lord! That's a one-day mustache?
And then I said something stupid.	Yeah...?	Well, let's see. "Fatigue, fever, malaise." Have you been to Hong Kong, sir?	Unfreeze, J.D. It's over.	Aggghhh! I just said "slaves" to my new black girlfriend!
I forgot that if any doctor suspects SARS, it's cause for immediate quarantine lockdown.	Could be SARS.	And then I said something stupid.	Yeah...?	Well, let's see. "Fatigue, fever, malaise." Have you been to Hong Kong, sir?
Don't make me say pants. I'll do it.Still tanning, I see.	No!	Say no more. Lonnie, shirt!	I don't know. I think it's kind of exciting...being in a hospital, getting to see you in action. I just wish I could be your assistant.	So be honest is this the worst first date you've ever been on or what?
Yeah.	He's your bitch, isn't he?	Don't make me say pants. I'll do it.Still tanning, I see.	No!	Say no more. Lonnie, shirt!
Gimme thirty dollars.	Yeah?	Elliot, I need another doctor over here, stat!	Get it!	I don't have it!
I need a dermatologist over here, stat!	I gave you twenty, I'm tapped!	Gimme thirty dollars.	Yeah?	Elliot, I need another doctor over here, stat!
Look, I paid this guy to fake a heart attack. He wants fifty bucks, we only have twenty.	Oh yeah! Time to shine!	I need a dermatologist over here, stat!	I gave you twenty, I'm tapped!	Gimme thirty dollars.
You have a trust fund! Now gimme the money!	You know, I feel like you guys just use me for my money.	Look, I paid this guy to fake a heart attack. He wants fifty bucks, we only have twenty.	Oh yeah! Time to shine!	I need a dermatologist over here, stat!
CLEAR!	Ehhh!	You have a trust fund! Now gimme the money!	You know, I feel like you guys just use me for my money.	Look, I paid this guy to fake a heart attack. He wants fifty bucks, we only have twenty.
J.D., one Lord, zero.	I'm alive!	CLEAR!	Ehhh!	You have a trust fund! Now gimme the money!
She would have said sexy if I had a mustache.	Genuine.	Here it comes sexy!	You know something? Seeing you in your element today, you seem so...	I could hear the pain in my best friend's voice, and I could feel how little I cared...because by the way Kylie was looking at me, I knew she thought I was sexy.
Cool.	You know, James lied all the time, and I don't know...it's just nice to be with a guy I can trust.	She would have said sexy if I had a mustache.	Genuine.	Here it comes sexy!
I race motorcycles.Excuse me.What the hell are you doing?	That's it you're stronger than this. Not another lie!	I certainly would never sleep with her.	And the lies begin again.	I barely know her.
For what?	I need more cash.	I race motorcycles.Excuse me.What the hell are you doing?	That's it you're stronger than this. Not another lie!	I certainly would never sleep with her.
Fine! But know this: you've been nothing but a disappointment to me since the moment I ran over you.	I'm puttin' DSL in my box.	For what?	I need more cash.	I race motorcycles.Excuse me.What the hell are you doing?
Yeah.... I understand. It's....	I'm not looking for a project.	If I don't come clean now, whether it's a few weeks or months or years from now, I know it's gonna come back to haunt me and ruin us, and I don't want that.	Why are you telling me this?	I had sex with her. A lot.
Wait. You know, if we if we leave like that, that's how we're always gonna remember this night. I don't want that.	So get it together.	Yeah.... I understand. It's....	I'm not looking for a project.	If I don't come clean now, whether it's a few weeks or months or years from now, I know it's gonna come back to haunt me and ruin us, and I don't want that.
Bye.Ahh. Kylie's in class all day and she bartends at night, and I'm still working sixteen-hour shifts, so we try to make sure we kiss at least once a day. Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, she takes a cab over here; Tuesdays and Thursdays, I scooter to my baby!	Bye.	Hi.	Hi.	YES! Ten to nine!
I mean, there's a lot of Sams....	Yeah.	Oh, well, that's understandable	No.	Really?
Thank you.	Probably.	Am I wrong, Elliot, or is that the kind of cough that needs a chest x-ray?	Oh, a couple of months now.	Mr. James, how long have you had that cough?
...there are moments when we all wish life was more like a sitcom.	Say, Kenny? Can I talk to you for a second?	...or having to do someone else's dirty work for them...	We couldn't even make it one day.	It was strange telling Mr. James he may only have a few weeks to live when just a few short hours ago we all thought he was fine....or realizing your relationship may not be as stable as you thought...
I'm sorry, too, sir.	I'm so sorry.	...there are moments when we all wish life was more like a sitcom.	Say, Kenny? Can I talk to you for a second?	...or having to do someone else's dirty work for them...
J.D.'s sitcom fantasy will be back after these messages!	Well, the good news is I won't have to eat my wife's cooking anymore, right!	I'm sorry, too, sir.	I'm so sorry.	...there are moments when we all wish life was more like a sitcom.
Is that my new sweater?!	Mopping time! Mopping time! It's mopping time!Yes, it's mopping time, my friend! And as you know, I always like to start in the exact spot you're standing. Let's get to work.Here we go.	It's floating wicker propelled by fire!Besides, I defy you to find one other thing that I'm afraid of!	Oh, my God. You're afraid of balloon rides, aren't you!	Safety is always important, Elliot.
It went dynamite with my beige cords!	No, this is my new sweater mop.	Is that my new sweater?!	Mopping time! Mopping time! It's mopping time!Yes, it's mopping time, my friend!

Hey everybody!Thanks for coming so quickly.You know, this is the kind of thing I normally say out loud in my head, but since we're all here...It just seems like, in the end, everything always works out. Because as long as we	Well, that's a load off my mind!	And who cares about him! He's anti-Semitic!	Wait a second! This chart isn't for Charles James, it's for James Charles! He's the one who has cancer, not you!	Well, I hope you had a good day, Mr. James!
Wait, this isn't right.	Mr. James? Mr. James, can you hear me?	Hey everybody!Thanks for coming so quickly.You know, this is the kind of thing I normally say out loud in my head, but since we're all here...It just seems like, in the end, everything always works out. Because as long as we	Well, that's a load off my mind!	And who cares about him! He's anti-Semitic!
Unfortunately, around here things don't always end as neat and tidy as they do in sitcoms.Relationships aren't always magically fixed in thirty minutes you have to work on them.Problems don't always have easy solutions.	We're gonna intubate!dopamine! Wide open! I need an ET tube. Where's anesthesia?	Wait, this isn't right.	Mr. James? Mr. James, can you hear me?	Hey everybody!Thanks for coming so quickly.You know, this is the kind of thing I normally say out loud in my head, but since we're all here...It just seems like, in the end, everything always works out.

Finally, sweep her off her feet with your vulnerable cuteness.	It is cold.	It's chilly out there.	Step Two: Sashay her into sympathy.	I am so pooped.
Tip the band leader and fluff up the pillows, because this dance is done.	You know what I call this weather? Snuggle weather.	Finally, sweep her off her feet with your vulnerable cuteness.	It is cold.	It's chilly out there.
Now, look, I need a favor. Let me try it. I'll move out for a week; if you still like it, I'll move out for good.All right. And d-d-d-don't worry about John Dorian, because I may be poor in pocket, but I'm rich in friends!	Chantal?	I banged your first girlfriend.	It was my idea.	Turk, I've always had your back and you always had mine. Are you sure you want to go through with this?
That's okay, because when God closes a window, he opens a door.	Nope.	Now, look, I need a favor. Let me try it. I'll move out for a week; if you still like it, I'll move out for good.All right. And d-d-d-don't worry about John Dorian, because I may be poor in pocket, but I'm rich in friends!	Chantal?	I banged your first girlfriend.
Kylie, I hear you. But trust me, this week is not gonna be about sex. Even though I think we both agree that's where we'd eventually like our relationship to end up, right?	I'm just not sure I'm comfortable with you sleeping here.	That's okay, because when God closes a window, he opens a door.	Nope.	Now, look, I need a favor. Let me try it. I'll move out for a week; if you still like it, I'll move out for good.All right. And d-d-d-don't worry about John Dorian, because I may be poor in pocket, but I'm rich in friends!
I don't think so, buddy.	So I hear you're homeless. I wanna volunteer, give you a place to stay.	Suit yourself.	I did a triple bypass yesterday. I think I could fix the heater.	I could probably stay and fix it. It could take three, four, five days.
You're gonna slather jam on my face and sic a family of raccoons on me, aren't you!	Listen, crash in my garage. I guarantee you there will not be another person in there.	I don't think so, buddy.	So I hear you're homeless. I wanna volunteer, give you a place to stay.	Suit yourself.
I'm out.	Damn it. I've become predictable.	You're gonna slather jam on my face and sic a family of raccoons on me, aren't you!	Listen, crash in my garage. I guarantee you there will not be another person in there.	I don't think so, buddy.
Options?! I got cable TV and a dead dog! I got plenty of options!	Oh, yeah? Well, from what I hear I'm your last option.	I'm out.	Damn it. I've become predictable.	You're gonna slather jam on my face and sic a family of raccoons on me, aren't you!
Okay.... But, Mr. McMahon, would you mind	No. He moved out.	Yeah.	The pathologist?	Does Doug Murphy live here?
You are correct, sir!	Hi-ohhhhhhhhhhh!	Okay.... But, Mr. McMahon, would you mind	No. He moved out.	Yeah.
Well, Turk lets me call him Brown Bear.	I'm sorry. Did you just call me black? Because the last time I checked, the correct term was "African-American."	Come on, you two are interracial best buddies. I, too, have a black best friend. Go out, enjoy it! Celebrate your uniqueness! I can do it!	Newbie, I've got this one covered.	Who needs a baby-sitter? I'll do it! You don't even have to pay me in cash, just pay me in hot showers. And you don't have to, like, wash me unless you want to, but that could be weird. I don't know.
I should go.	Who the hell is Turk?!	Well, Turk lets me call him Brown Bear.	I'm sorry. Did you just call me black? Because the last time I checked, the correct term was "African-American."	Come on, you two are interracial best buddies. I, too, have a black best friend. Go out, enjoy it! Celebrate your uniqueness! I can do it!
Get the moment back! Say something hot!	Uh, J.D., maybe you should go home.	I don't want to come home. It took me a month to get here from the couch.	J.D.!	I couldn't have planned it better.
I missed you, my African-American friend.	I'm glad you're home, buddy.	It's always nice to let your friends know that you appreciate them.	I'm home!You guys moved couch?	At first I was a little disappointed that I wasn't sleeping at Kylie's, but it was good to be home.
Brown Bear.	Call me Brown Bear.	I missed you, my African-American friend.	I'm glad you're home, buddy.	It's always nice to let your friends know that you appreciate them.
But sometimes you just can't quite find words to show that appreciation.	This, uh...is a classmate of mine from medical school. He's located up in your area now. I think he'd really be able to help you.	Brown Bear.	Call me Brown Bear.	I missed you, my African-American friend.
You just have to hope that your honesty doesn't make them realize something they didn't wanna know.	I don't know, I never really thought about it. I guess when you care about someone, you'll do whatever you can to make 'em happy.	At the end of the day, the best thing to do for your friends is to be honest.	The laundry, the fixing the radiator, the listening to me gossip and playing stupid games with Turk. How do you make yourself do all that stuff?	What do you mean?
Yes please.	Howdy, stranger. Do you still want me?	*Thank God Turk left because I can't think about sex anymore. Luckily	Damn you, ruptured spleen! To be continued!	Dude it was so naughty. We're kissing, right, and she's like "I think

That's J.D.	Bye. How you doing, J.J.?	*So Molly's back in town. She definitely wants me.*	Hey stranger. Ouch!	Yes please.
Good Times?	Oh, right. I was just thinking of that Jimmy Walker sitcom.	That's J.D.	Bye. How you doing, J.J.?	*So Molly's back in town. She definitely wants me.*
Can I say hi?	Yeah.	Your college girlfriend?	Rosanna.	Who are you talking to?
Hey Rosanna.	Yeah.	Can I say hi?	Yeah.	Your college girlfriend?
Who?	Let's just say a little birdie told me that you and Kylie haven't	What are you implying?	Dude, you're pretty horny for a guy who claims to be getting it on a	God, I'd love to get with Molly.
She did go to a movie with her brother-in-law.	Look. Kylie hasn't slept with you so what she's saying is that she	Oh really Turk? Has it been a month? Because time just flies when	Dude, it's been a month.	I trusted you!
That is the dumbest idea I've ever heard.	That's perfect. Dude, you can have your cake and eat it too. It's like	She did go to a movie with her brother-in-law.	Look. Kylie hasn't slept with you so what she's saying is that she	Oh really Turk? Has it been a month? Because time just flies when
Um, nothing, Kylie. It's a new band called the Naked Sweat Drips. They	What?	Naked sweat drips...	...this ninety degree cave and sweat would just be dripping off our	Hey, Kylie. I was calling to see how your day was going.
*They say the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry.*	Hey. I'm getting out of here. Do you want to grab a beer?	A patient, Kylie. Horrible car accident. You gotta wear your seatbelt,	Who has their feet behind their head?	Feet up behind her head.
Oh no, it's the 'Close' button. When somebody gets close it activates	That's the 'Close' button.	Yeah! You should come with us!	Hey guys, you going out?	Actually, Kylie. I... I can't tonight.*If having my cake and eating it too meant being with Molly, then

I do. *I knew at that moment what would happen if I reached over and	You think so?	*I said control yourself!* You know	It's tough making new friends in Milwaukee.	*Okay J.D., you're a little drunk. And you know what happens when you
And Kylie, you're right. It is fate. Because I was out with this girl	First, let me set the mood.	Wait, are you saying that you're ready? Awesome.	I was thinking about how patient you've been with me. How right	Oh, Kylie. I'm sorry. I hope it's okay that I stopped by. What was that for?
Well, she's not a random girl. I mean, I had a crush on her long	You blew me off tonight to be with some random girl?	And Kylie, you're right. It is fate. Because I was out with this girl	First, let me set the mood.	Wait, are you saying that you're ready? Awesome.
Yeah, but last week I set it back three hours so we could see what it felt like to live in Honolulu.	Yeah, but I set the clock ahead an hour last night so I wouldn't be late.	*Turk and Carla were having relationship troubles so she'd been staying at Elliot's for a few days.* You were late the last time.	I've got time.	That is the most ridiculous hat I've ever seen. *And I must have it.*
But then I set it back forty-three minutes to 8:08, turned the clock upside-down to see if it looked like the word Bob, which incidentally, it totally does	Yeah, but then I set the clock ahead five hours so I wouldn't feel like a skeeve for watching porn in the middle of the day.	Yeah, but last week I set it back three hours so we could see what it felt like to live in Honolulu.	Yeah, but I set the clock ahead an hour last night so I wouldn't be late.	*Turk and Carla were having relationship troubles so she'd been staying at Elliot's for a few days.* You were late the last time.
Which means that it's actually...	That's true.	But then I set it back forty-three minutes to 8:08, turned the clock upside-down to see if it looked like the word Bob, which incidentally, it totally does	Yeah, but then I set the clock ahead five hours so I wouldn't feel like a skeeve for watching porn in the middle of the day.	Yeah, but last week I set it back three hours so we could see what it felt like to live in Honolulu.
Don't worry, Turk, I got 'em!	Sorry. My bad, dude, my bad.	Oh really, Turk, was it a thick bush? Because there's berries in my ass! Just go!	That was a thick bush!	You got it, player! Hold on buddy!
No way, dude. It's never smart to get in the middle of someone else's relationship.	Yeah, mine did too. That's why I need you to go in.	My head hurts.	I did. But apparently if I'm the one she didn't know she could trust, how's she supposed to trust she can trust me telling her she can trust me?	Just tell her she can trust you.
Hey! Wanna grab a beer?	I'll let you wear my top hat.	No way, dude. It's never smart to get in the middle of someone else's relationship.	Yeah, mine did too. That's why I need you to go in.	My head hurts.
Two appletinis, guv'ner!	I'll let you put the hat back on.	But I told Turk I'd talk about him constantly until you made me leave.	J.D., I know what you're trying to do and it's very sweet, but the last couple of days have been so messed up and confusing, I'd love to just try and forget about it and have a few drinks, okay?	No, but I can tell you who doesn't sing it. Billy Joel, who brought us such hits as "Uptown Girl" and "Matter of Trust". And speaking of trust, do you know who's really trustworthy? Turk. I call him Turkey Turkey Turkey Turkey Trust Trust. A little nickname.
I can let go of the couch, if I so choose.	Then why can't you let go of the couch?	Carla, I'm not as think as you drunk I am. I mean...	J.D., you're drunk!	Because you can see Elliot's whole apartment from up here.
*There are many things we can't control, no matter how strong we might be. Like a kneejerk reaction.*	Okay, let go of the couch. Let go! You see?	I can let go of the couch, if I so choose.	Then why can't you let go of the couch?	Carla, I'm not as think as you drunk I am. I mean...
Good night.	Good night.	Right.	Nothing happened.	You're welcome. *And sometimes, you let go of the control you do have in a brief moment of weakness.* Sorry. Drunken accident.
Good night.	Good night.	Good night.	Good night.	Right.
Buenas... those things.	Buenas noches.	Good night.	Good night.	Good night.
*Like she said, everything's fine.**There's nothing like the rays of the morning sun kissing you awake and gently reminding you that you got drunk and kissed your best friend's wife.* Oh my God!	Good night.	Buenas... those things.	Buenas noches.	Good night.
Yeah, but it was nothing!	Oh my God. So it really happened?	*Like she said, everything's fine.**There's nothing like the rays of the morning sun kissing you awake and gently reminding you that you got drunk and kissed your best friend's wife.* Oh my God!	Good night.	Buenas... those things.
No! There wasn't even any tongue!	Nothing!	Yeah, but it was nothing!	Oh my God. So it really happened?	*Like she said, everything's fine.**There's nothing like the rays of the morning sun kissing you awake and gently reminding you that you got drunk and kissed your best friend's wife.* Oh my God!
It was just a friend kiss!	No tongue!	No! There wasn't even any tongue!	Nothing!	Yeah, but it was nothing!
No, I pursed them like this.	Were your lips parted at all?	It was just a friend kiss!	No tongue!	No! There wasn't even any tongue!
Yes it is! It's a friend kiss and we will never talk about this to anyone ever!	I don't know, J.D. I remember my one lip being on top of your upper lip and my other lip being somewhere in the middle of yours, which means your lips were apart and I don't think that's a friend kiss.	No, I pursed them like this.	Were your lips parted at all?	It was just a friend kiss!
Nothing.	What's going on?	Yes it is! It's a friend kiss and we will never talk about this to anyone ever!	I don't know, J.D. I remember my one lip being on top of your upper lip and my other lip being somewhere in the middle of yours, which means your lips were apart and I don't think that's a friend kiss.	No, I pursed them like this.
Carla!	J.D. and I kissed.	Nothing.	What's going on?	Yes it is! It's a friend kiss and we will never talk about this to anyone ever!
Yes!	You kissed? Like a friend kiss?	Carla!	J.D. and I kissed.	Nothing.
Carla! You're killing me!	No!	Yes!	You kissed? Like a friend kiss?	Carla!
Ted, lunch was four hours ago.	I like to do stomach crunches after lunch.	Ted, what are you doing?	A little help!	I had to hide from Turk, so I went to the one place that I knew no one would ever venture. Ted? Ted?
It's Wednesday.	Yep, I wasted most of my Tuesday.	Ted, lunch was four hours ago.	I like to do stomach crunches after lunch.	Ted, what are you doing?
*Alright, he knows your lying face, but silence is incriminating too. So think. What's between silence and talking?*	Calm down, I just want to see if you got anywhere with Carla.	No, because this is two degrees worse. I can't breathe, it's like you're all over me. I'm trapped in a death coffin.	Don't you mean third degree?	Whoa! What's with the fifth degree?
I guess I'm glad we kissed then.	Well, I wasn't saving your ass. I didn't realize how easy it is to make little mistakes. They're stupid little mistakes that seem like nothing but can snowball on you and take your whole marriage with it, you know? I feel like I really understand now how Turk could have let stuff like that happen, you know? So I forgave him.	Thanks for saving my ass.	I know my own body.	Ted, you should probably sit down. You're looking a little purple.
*It may take a lot of work, but it's worth it.*Wow, that was a moist kiss. Wish I was wearing an apron.	Yeah! And then I pulled off Grandma's breathing apparatus. No, I'm serious!	*Or a patient trusting his doctor to help him hold on to his dignity.*	Hey Jack! Just blink when you want me to get you down. Just give me the old blink-a-rooney. Terrific athlete. I'm thinking 2016 Olympics. Oh God, was that a blink? Excuse me.	*Even if it involves a compromise.*
*Because in the end, things work out for the best.*	Baby, from here on out I hide nothing from you. It's a clean start for us. Sports time!	*It may take a lot of work, but it's worth it.*Wow, that was a moist kiss. Wish I was wearing an apron.	Yeah! And then I pulled off Grandma's breathing apparatus. No, I'm serious!	*Or a patient trusting his doctor to help him hold on to his dignity.*
*Or not.*	J.D. and I kissed.	*Because in the end, things work out for the best.*	Baby, from here on out I hide nothing from you. It's a clean start for us. Sports time!	*It may take a lot of work, but it's worth it.*Wow, that was a moist kiss. Wish I was wearing an apron.
Well that's kind of a trick question, Turk. I mean if I say yes, it's like I'm saying "damn dude, your wife is hot & I'd like to get me some of that". But if I say no then I'm all like "yo, I know she's your wife but you can keep that fish-lipped bitty".	Did you like it?	I miss the silence.	You kissed my wife.	When we got to work, not a whole lot had changed. The silence was killing me...
I was staying in their guest-room & she was buffing the nightstand and she just kept on buffing. But hey, thanks for taking the hit on this one.	You slept with Tuni?	Don't worry, this'll all be fine. You know Turk, I mean, whomever he blames will get the silent treatment for a couple of days, then he'll make snarky comments for a few months and then, sooner or later, he'll be laughing about the whole thing. It's just like the time I slept with his family's cleaning lady.	I'm sorry. The only way I'm gonna have closure here is if I can blame one of you guys. I just gotta figure out who.	No Turk, it's understandable.
Oh but all you have to do is have sex with him & he'll forgive you. If I have sex with him he'll probably end up madder.	Me? Na-a na-a, you're his best friend, all you have to do is say "I'm sorry", high-five him & go "DAAAAHHHHH!"	I was staying in their guest-room & she was buffing the nightstand and she just kept on buffing. But hey, thanks for taking the hit on this one.	You slept with Tuni?	Don't worry, this'll all be fine.

Agreed.Dude she was pouring drinks into me & she knows I put out when I'm drunk.	You know what; let's not play into his blame game.	Oh but all you have to do is have sex with him & he'll forgive you.

DAAAAHHHHH!	He took me to a bar.	Agreed.Dude she was pouring drinks into me & she knows I put out when I'm drunk.	You know what; let's not play into his blame game.	Oh but all you have to do is have sex with him & he'll forgive you. If I have sex with him he'll probably end up madder.
I'm telling you dude, she was all over me. Like ants on candy.	I didn't ask him to walk me home.	DAAAAHHHHH!	He took me to a bar.	Agreed.Dude she was pouring drinks into me & she knows I put out when I'm drunk.
OK, there it is. Thanks Roland, one day I'll get it.	Pop the hips, pop the hips J.D.	After sharing a quick victory dance with Roland, the heavy-set orderly who, coincidentally, was my victory dance coach...	I got 3 words for you; sucks to be, adding a fourth, you .	Be gracious.
I got to thinking about relationships, about how people fall in love...Have kids...Grow old together...And say goodbye...And then for some reason I thought about the circus... but then I was back on relationships...	I doubt it.	OK, there it is. Thanks Roland, one day I'll get it.	Pop the hips, pop the hips J.D.	After sharing a quick victory dance with Roland, the heavy-set orderly who, coincidentally, was my victory dance coach...
And I couldn't help thinking that maybe it wasn't luck that made relationships last. Maybe it was just a matter of who takes fewer hits...	Back to your room Mr. Johnson, you've got one ventricle!	I got to thinking about relationships, about how people fall in love...Have kids...Grow old together...And say goodbye...And then for some reason I thought about the circus... but then I was back on relationships...	I doubt it.	OK, there it is. Thanks Roland, one day I'll get it.
And I realized I should have been the one to take that hit, not Carla.	You don't have to talk to me, just wave if you're gonna give me a ride home.	And I couldn't help thinking that maybe it wasn't luck that made relationships last. Maybe it was just a matter of who takes fewer hits...	Back to your room Mr. Johnson, you've got one ventricle!

I don't know, it just came to me.You know I'm right Turk.	A cowboy?	I know but I told her my name was Turk. Look the point is, think of the millions of times you chose to not to hang out with your wife, 'cause you were trying to hang out with me. You know, maybe it's time you started acting like a real husband, instead of acting like some sort of crazy... cowboy.	That wasn't me that was you!	Dude, who do you think you're talking to, you think you've been the World's greatest husband? Please, I was there when you were flirting with your ex-girlfriend & neglected to tell her you were married. I was there when you tried to hook up with that waitress, the day before you got engaged. And I was definitely there when you hooked up with that nasty ass stripper at "Boobies, Boobies, Boobies".
Other times, it's about swallowing that damn pride...	OK how about this one? Three blue-jays fly into a bar & they say, "we just want to wet out beaks". Ha, ha, ha... no? Sorry Dan, you tell one.	Sometimes sacrifice is only wearing your new uni when you're not at work...	Hey!Look here, I was thinking maybe, maybe you'd rather just stay in tonight. You know have some pizza watch, watch some movies, what do you say?Are you trying to smile?You're so damned cute.	A lot of times, the answer is about sacrifice...
But ultimately, big or small, sacrifice is about doing something you don't really wanna do.	J.D., would you hand me the wine please? Turk's not talking to me.	Other times, it's about swallowing that damn pride...	OK how about this one? Three blue-jays fly into a bar & they say, "we just want to wet out beaks". Ha, ha, ha... no? Sorry Dan, you tell one.	Sometimes sacrifice is only wearing your new uni when you're not at work...
You're gonna miss me though.	Wow, thanks man.	Man, you guys need your space.	Really?	Hey guys, I know we talked about this before but, I'm moving out.
That's me! Betty, Dr. Dorian. 'Cocoon'. Wilford Brimley. Steve Guttenberg. The whole day. No?	Who's that?	Oh, don't worry about her, Betty, you're in good hands with Dr. Dorian.	Is Dr. Reid coming back?	So Elliot, the first thing we're gonna need to do is....
Then you're ready to die.Look, Betty, is there anyone you'd like to talk this over with?She just wants to talk to you for a minute.	Ohhh! I am very, very comfortable!	There you go, Betty! That's every cotton ball in the hospital!	"As comfortable as possible." I've said that a million times and I still have no idea what it means.	Well, we could put you on a breathing machine, but it's unlikely you'd ever come off of it. Or I could just make sure you're as comfortable as possible.
Just about how and when she should die.	Yeah? About what?	Then you're ready to die.Look, Betty, is there anyone you'd like to talk this over with?She just wants to talk to you for a minute.	Ohhh! I am very, very comfortable!	There you go, Betty! That's every cotton ball in the hospital!
Look, this woman is alone, she's depressed, and for some reason she feels like she's connected with you.	Oh, that's not a problem. I counsel most of my random neighbors on their deathbeds.	Just about how and when she should die.	Yeah? About what?	Then you're ready to die.Look, Betty, is there anyone you'd like to talk this over with?She just wants to talk to you for a minute.
That's great! Keep it light! Open with a joke, and before you know it you and your raft will be on a four-hour trip to New Zealand!	Look, I'm sorry, but I wouldn't know what to say.	Look, this woman is alone, she's depressed, and for some reason she feels like she's connected with you.	Oh, that's not a problem. I counsel most of my random neighbors on their deathbeds.	Just about how and when she should die.
Oh no. You're dangerously close to revealing that geography is your Achilles heel. Say something smart to regain credibility.	No, it's more like fourteen hours.	That's great! Keep it light! Open with a joke, and before you know it you and your raft will be on a four-hour trip to New Zealand!	Look, I'm sorry, but I wouldn't know what to say.	Look, this woman is alone, she's depressed, and for some reason she feels like she's connected with you.
Let's try it again. I'll see you later, buddy. Bye!	See what?	Really? Oh, okay. I'll see you later. Bye.Ow! You see!	I'm not upset!	Well, I think that's true. I mean, if you look at the whole Carla kissing thing, I think intellectually you moved on, but emotionally you're still upset. You'll get there, though, pal.
OW! Always the same spot! It's like your fingers are stone!	Bye.	Let's try it again. I'll see you later, buddy. Bye!	See what?	Really? Oh, okay. I'll see you later. Bye.Ow! You see!
No I didn't, Jake.	You just said your name in a weird kinda summing-up way.	Wha?	What?	Dr. John Dorian.
See, that's summing up in a weird way.	Ah, so you're Jake! Uh, as I understand it, you just talked my sister into ending her life. Long story short: I'm a lawyer, I'm suing you. Once again: Sister dying, brother lawyer, suing you!	No I didn't, Jake.	You just said your name in a weird kinda summing-up way.	Wha?
"Brother lawyer." That's it.	Yeah.	See, that's summing up in a weird way.	Ah, so you're Jake! Uh, as I understand it, you just talked my sister into ending her life. Long story short: I'm a lawyer, I'm suing you. Once again: Sister dying, brother lawyer, suing you!	No I didn't, Jake.
I am not from the future, Jake!Yes! It finally worked! What are the odds?	Just admit it you're just here from the future to destroy me.	"Buy Groceries. Kill Self."	He spelled "attorney" wrong.	Go take a nap, Ted.
Who's Greg Barton?	I don't know what the odds are, J.D., but what I do know is I'm about to go down to my truck, get my kayak paddle, and go Greg Barton on your ass.	I am not from the future, Jake!Yes! It finally worked! What are the odds?	Just admit it you're just here from the future to destroy me.	"Buy Groceries. Kill Self."
Oh, Greg Barton!	He's a famous kayaker.	Who's Greg Barton?	I don't know what the odds are, J.D., but what I do know is I'm about to go down to my truck, get my kayak paddle, and go Greg Barton on your ass.	I am not from the future, Jake!Yes! It finally worked! What are the odds?
I know.	I hate you, J.D.	Oh, Greg Barton!	He's a famous kayaker.	Who's Greg Barton?
...Anyway, I knew what I had to do.	She fell again.	Kelso had a point. I mean, in the outside world you'll occasionally see a stream of cars drive by an old woman with a flat tire. But around here, every time you round a corner, well...	I didn't say it wasn't funny; I just said it happened. Come on, when's the last time you saw a glimpse of humanity in this place.	Sir, you laughed and pointed when she fell.
He just left!	Where's he going?	Oh. Well go, anyway, wherever it is you're rafting.	You've been brushing up on New England.	Just go, Jake! No one here knows your last name if anything happens, he'll never be able to find you. Go enjoy your little rafting thing in New Zealand which, incidentally, is ten thousand miles east of Australia, and famous for alcoholism and clam chowder. I've been brushing up on my New Zealand.
Righty loosey, lefty tighty.	Yep. It sure feels good to do the right thing.	And don't you forget who put that tire on and tightened those lugnuts, Martha! Okay, sweetie, have fun at the swap-meet! Drive safe.	I can't believe that six young men stopped to help an old lady change a tire!	As for me, seeing Jake come back and do the right thing restored my faith in humanity.
Dude, you're not gonna believe how much trouble I'm having finding a place to live.	Thank you.	I'm just kidding. We'll have some sent right to your room, big guy.	What?	Jello-O is for winners.
Yeah.	Great guy.	Good guy.	I got this round. Be right back.	Well, I could use a beer.
Excellent choice.	Oh, my God!	Yeah.	Great guy.	Good guy.
Mmm. Doesn't Kathleen Turner have dynamite nerps?	Wow, this 'Body Heats a sexy movie, huh?	So it's important to have a plan to deal with it. Even if it means never being alone with someone.	Well, the guy started choking, so naturally I sprung into action and gave him an emergency trach.Yeah.	There are certain people in life who know how to push your buttons.
Of course, if that person is stubborn, there's not much you can do.	Yeah.	Mmm. Doesn't Kathleen Turner have dynamite nerps?	Wow, this 'Body Heats a sexy movie, huh?	So it's important to have a plan to deal with it. Even if it means never being alone with someone.
Between these thoughts.	When do you find time to see your patients?	So when we go to pick teams, I'm gonna hit that shot. Then you say, "I'll take that guy!" At which point, Carla is gonna page me . And I'll say, "Crap, I gotta go." And you go, "Damn! We just lost the best player out here!" Then there'll be eight guys in the hospital who think I'm good at sports, and word will spread.	Ah-huh?	Okay, so here's what's gonna happen: I finally mastered my running hook-shot, okay?
Elliot's boyfriend, Jake, had given her confidence to do things she'd never been able to do before.	Oh. Okay. Let's play some ball!I got that guy.	Between these thoughts.	When do you find time to see your patients?	So when we go to pick teams, I'm gonna hit that shot. Then you say, "I'll take that guy!" At which point, Carla is gonna page me . And I'll say, "Crap, I gotta go." And you go, "Damn! We just lost the best player out here!" Then there'll be eight guys in the hospital who think I'm good at sports, and word will spread.
"Super Chocolate Bear."	What does "SCB" mean?	Yeah.	Wow.	Oh, thanks SCB! By the way, I should tell you something: I found an apartment, I'm moving out the day after tomorrow.
I knew you would.	I love it.	"Super Chocolate Bear."	What does "SCB" mean?	Yeah.
Oh! Can we cut words out of magazines that represent how we feel about each other and glue them into a "Friends Forever" collage?	Okay, now, if you reel it back a little bit, I'll get somebody to cover for me tonight, and I'll help you pack your stuff.	Guilty.	You know how you're prone to overly sensitive girly displays of sentimentality?	Yeah, but we won't be able to stay up 'til six in the morning planning anything as genius as the soup shower! This is the end of an era, Super Choc.
Oh. Well, can we drink beers and reminisce?	Hell no.	Oh! Can we cut words out of magazines that represent how we feel about each other and glue them into a "Friends Forever" collage?	Okay, now, if you reel it back a little bit, I'll get somebody to cover for me tonight, and I'll help you pack your stuff.	Guilty.
That's all I wanted to do anyway.	Hell yes!	Oh. Well, can we drink beers and reminisce?	Hell no.	Oh! Can we cut words out of magazines that represent how we feel about each other and glue them into a "Friends Forever" collage?
Touché, magic hallway.	Listen, Jordan, I've been incredibly insensitive.	Okay, but Turk's a prideful guy, and it's hard for prideful guys to admit when they've been insensitive.	Carla, I can sense you're upset. Talk to me.	Maybe I was being unfair to Turk. Maybe it's too much to expect a friend to just sense that you're upset and wanna talk about it.
Wait, where's Rowdy?There he is!THERE HE IS!	Then things took a turn.	Hooch is crazy....So, Hooch, this is it.	No, it's me Hooch, Vanilla Bear! Heh heh!	Turk!
Mmkay.	That's Carla and I gotta go.	Well, say things'll be the same.	J.D., you're just moving out.	Look, before, when you said I'd never be as cool as when I was living with you, you know there's some truth to that. I'm sorta like odd and geeky, and you've always sort of...validated me.
Who would do this to themselves?	Really.Huh?	Really?	I dunno. I think it's 'cause this time, I wasn't trying to mess with you.	Why are you so obsessed with this!?
As every piece of food I'd put into my body in the last year was rushing out of me, it got me thinking. The way some things never change shines a light on the things that do.Like when a new person comes into the hospital to stay...	Totally worth it.	Who would do this to themselves?	Really.Huh?	Really?
I didn't care, because now that I'm and attending, I had picked out a whole new look.	Ow! Look, no harm done. Here's your driving glasses, here's your driving scarf, and here are you driving gloves.Fine, here's your driving sock.	This didn't feel like my scooter.	Hey! You took my Porsche from the valet?	Yep, life was pretty different.
Ooh, what, tall, dark and scary? I can wear whatever the hell I What are you doing?	Oh, absolutely not.	Morning, colleague!	I didn't care, because now that I'm and attending, I had picked out a whole new look.	Ow! Look, no harm done. Here's your driving glasses, here's your driving scarf, and here are you driving gloves.Fine, here's your driving sock.
Born without lips.	How depressing is it being you? I mean seriously, would you equate it more with being a lifelong Cub fan or to, say, being born without lips?	Ow.Whoooaaaaahhhh! OK, you know, I'm gonna I'm gonna go with 'ow.'	It'll happen.	I had a little trouble getting my Baby Gap t-shirt off.
How sad.	I know a guy. His house just burned down.	Born without lips.	How depressing is it being you? I mean seriously, would you equate it more with being a lifelong Cub fan or to, say, being born without lips?	Ow.Whoooaaaaahhhh! OK, you know, I'm gonna I'm gonna go with 'ow.'
Listen, today, if you bother me, could you do it without being around me? Because I have new interns starting today. Can you imagine what it's like to see this place through their eyes for the first time?	Well, he was smoking in bed. He shouldn't have smoked. Because he looked ridiculous.I have a snake face.	How sad.	I know a guy. His house just burned down.	Born without lips.
Yes we are.	Lindsay, by you reaching the level of attending physician, you've somehow managed to become a member of club that *I* belong to. Obviously, there was no vote, because if there had been, you would still hear the sound of my voice screaming, "Nay! Nay! Oh, dear God, one thousand times nay!" That being said, it's my obligation to let you in on the organization's one and only bylaw: We're men.	Thanks, Dr. Kelso! You know he said half-sincere, but I think he was full-sincere. Feel my shoulder, it's still warm.	Now there's an answer that warrants a half-sincere pat on the shoulder.	I turned in my paperwork already, but I'm gonna wait till tomorrow to turn in my urine sample out of respect for the fellows in the lab. There's an asparagus issue.
I don't need your approval, or your stupid man cards! Although the lettering is darling, have you ever done calligraphy?	The women are men, the children are men, the men of course...*men.* So, I went ahead and took the liberty of making you five man cards.Hold them very dear because every time you drop the ball "manwise," I'm going to take one from you.

Damn it!	Absolutely no lover's quarrels!	Well maybe a hundred wasn't enough, I don't know!	And maybe someone already apologized for that about a hundred times.	Maybe someone or something had to gnaw a hole in it to keep from suffocating.
Interns.	Uh...Eh..	Hey Keith! Can I get your pudding?	Mmmmm.	The Turks are sneaky.Not you guys, I think Omar took my pudding.
Baby I'll be thinking about your lovelies and whatnot until the second I see you. But right now, I'm doin' my business.	Turk?	OK, you've been working on your Turk impression since college. Time to shine!	Turk? I'm leaving for work.	Being Turk's secret roommate was going great. Until now.
I've been thinking about how completely ridiculous it is that you would take Mr. Kellerman's life into your hands without talking to him.	Yup.	You know what I've been doing? I mean, besides listening to my Alanis Morissette CD to get me pumped up to talk to you? Here.	Thank you.	Hey!
Morning, friends! Who's ready for some java?	J.D.?	Allow me to thank you for giving me the opportunity to prove myself. You know what? This is my last one, here.Take it! Whatever happens to this poor guy is on you.s Narration: The next morning was not good. Carla was not talking to Turk. Elliot had dropped by to help not talk to Turk, and I was sneaking out in my undies because my clothes were downstairs in the dryer.	Because you're an attending now. And that doesn't just mean a fat bank account, expensive new toys and a fancy lawyer on retainer for when you kill a prostitute. From now on, the buck stops with you, and I know that you have occasionally bent the rules in this dump over the last couple of years, but you only did it because you knew when the crap started raining down it was damn sure gonna fall on my head. But now, the only way for you to stay out of the trouble storm is for you to go by the book and I've got news for you on that front. By-the-book attendings kill us up here. Newbie, I couldn't tell you about Kellerman because I don't know what type of attending you're going to be.	Then why didn't you tell me?
Yes, I am, Carla, because I know when Turk's sad, he likes me to come over in my boxers because he likes to call me his honky Adonis, and that's what friends do.	Are you wearing boxers?	Morning, friends! Who's ready for some java?	J.D.?	Allow me to thank you for giving me the opportunity to prove myself. You know what? This is my last one, here.Take it! Whatever happens to this poor guy is on you.s Narration: The next morning was not good. Carla was not talking to Turk. Elliot had dropped by to help not talk to Turk, and I was sneaking out in my undies because my clothes were downstairs in the dryer.
Turk, why?	Actually, J.D.'s been living here secretly.	Oh, it's my new driving sock.You can borrow.	What's that?	They bought it? Are we that gay?
J.D. didn't want to live here, I begged him.	Because I gotta get those damn judgmental eyes off me!	Turk, why?	Actually, J.D.'s been living here secretly.	Oh, it's my new driving sock.You can borrow.
I guess so.	Nothing. But now I need to know: is this the type of attending you're going to be?	What?	Dr. Dorian, I've kept my mouth shut about all the recent sexual harassment complaints because I don't think it's fair to punish a man for making small talk, or say, asking his secretary just once to dress up as a geisha girl and call him Kelso-san.	He's my patient, Bob. I'm responsible.
I could tell him there's nothing in my cup and I'm just pretending to drink to seem non-chalant...	Anything else?	I guess so.	Nothing. But now I need to know: is this the type of attending you're going to be?	What?
But instead, I was thinking about what Carla said about moving on. And I wasn't the only one.	No.	I could tell him there's nothing in my cup and I'm just pretending to drink to seem non-chalant...	Anything else?	I guess so.
I'm gonna have a good year, aren't I?	You held onto it as long as you could, didn't you?	Wow. Want a hug?	I'm gonna go ahead and give you back one of these man cards. You deserve it.	Thanks for nothing, assface.
And I knew he was right.	Anything can happen.	I'm gonna have a good year, aren't I?	You held onto it as long as you could, didn't you?	Wow. Want a hug?
AARGH!	Excuse me.	And I knew he was right.	Anything can happen.	I'm gonna have a good year, aren't I?
It was worth it!	Dude, there's a guy upstairs waiting to have his spleen removed.	Wasn't that your nickname in high school? Hello! Huh, huh, huh, huh.	A small one-pump mocha?	So what did you want me to get you?
We even spent this weekend building a house for the homeless.	You seem to be developing quite the rapport with your interns.	There it is! All right, kick some ass today, guys.Except for Mr. Woodson in 302, he's got that rectal tear.	First, do no harm!	Hippocratic Oath on three! One! Two! Three!
Nice!In my defense, who wears a tie to a construction site?	How'd that go?	We even spent this weekend building a house for the homeless.	You seem to be developing quite the rapport with your interns.	There it is! All right, kick some ass today, guys.Except for Mr. Woodson in 302, he's got that rectal tear.
So tell me something, Carla, has she invited you to her new hospital?	Yeah, I think I've made my point.	Mmmm. That's headed right to our joint colon.	Mmmm.	Here it is.
Victory sip!	Hmmmm?	So tell me something, Carla, has she invited you to her new hospital?	Yeah, I think I've made my point.	Mmmm. That's headed right to our joint colon.
Whatever. If it wasn't funny, why did they all laugh?	Yes, and you're a terrible teacher. I'm not prepared to operate on anyone.	Have you been following me around all day dressed like an intern?	Not funny.	OK, gang I'll meet you up in radiology to talk about Mr. Heath's CAT scan. His tumor's getting so big it's starting to look like a three-mor.
Unbelievable. From now on, there 's absolutely no laughing at my jokes unless they're particularly hysterical! Talk about your mission impossibles, huh, huh, huh, huh.	Look! Your jokes kinda suck and when I laugh, you pick me to do procedures.	Keith, I hope you die a violent death and bugs eat your corpse.	Well, we've been kind of fake laughing.	We'll catch her up later. Have you guys been fake laughing at my jokes? Be honest. I promise, absolutely no ramifications.
What is it with you and the costumes today?	Case closed.	Unbelievable. From now on, there 's absolutely no laughing at my jokes unless they're particularly hysterical! Talk about your mission impossibles, huh, huh, huh, huh.	Look! Your jokes kinda suck and when I laugh, you pick me to do procedures.	Keith, I hope you die a violent death and bugs eat your corpse.
Hey! Why don't guys go upstairs and do some work!And for God's sake, will somebody wake up Gloria?OK, enough waving. You wave too much. You abuse waving. Go!	No! But I looked up to you!	No! See your death.	Really?	This is a little trust exercise that I really think is gonna connect us again. Remove your blindfolds, please.See your death, see your death, see your death...Keith...Don't worry, buddy. We're cool.
Gloria.	There it is, just like I said. I can feel your hatred like a cool spring breeze. Ah!	Hey! Why don't guys go upstairs and do some work!And for God's sake, will somebody wake up Gloria?OK, enough waving. You wave too much. You abuse waving. Go!	No! But I looked up to you!	No! See your death.
You know what? I want the laughter back!And you know what, I liked it when you waved, you were always waving...Why don't all of you just wave? All right.	Still, good guy or not, there's no reason why you shouldn't enjoy the perks.	No, you guys are fine. You're doing a good job.	Did we do something wrong Dr. Dorian?	I think it's always easier to be a jerk than a good guy.
I can't imagine what it would be like if I were all on my own.	Hey, guys. What's going on?	Ultimately, you can deal with anything, as long as you have a group of friends around to go through it all with you.	You know what? I want the laughter back!And you know what, I liked it when you waved, you were always waving...Why don't all of you just wave? All right.	Still, good guy or not, there's no reason why you shouldn't enjoy the perks.
Love the superficial. Dynamite teeth today.	J.D. and I keep it superficial.	You know, relationships and things of that nature.	We've managed to restore our friendship by staying away from dangerous topics.	I'm a little proud.
Sparkly!	Oh, thanks, buddy!	Love the superficial. Dynamite teeth today.	J.D. and I keep it superficial.	You know, relationships and things of that nature.
Your place. Look I can't just un-e-vite everyone, I've already gotten two e-yeses and twenty-four e-maybes. That's a lot of e-sponses.	Whose place?	Friday's my birthday! I've already e-vited everyone over to our place.	Friday.	Friday?
It's a Mexican-themed fiesta on the first anniversary of my 29th birthday. That means I'm turning 30. Donde? 56 Walnut Drive. Cuando? Thank you for asking. Ocho-thirty until upside-down question mark. Sombreros at the door. Arrrrrrrrrooo!	Bambi, I'm gonna put my e-foot up your ass.	Your place. Look I can't just un-e-vite everyone, I've already gotten two e-yeses and twenty-four e-maybes. That's a lot of e-sponses.	Whose place?	Friday's my birthday! I've already e-vited everyone over to our place.
Gracias, amigo. I borrowed one of your dictionaries.	I'll be there.	It's a Mexican-themed fiesta on the first anniversary of my 29th birthday. That means I'm turning 30. Donde? 56 Walnut Drive. Cuando? Thank you for asking. Ocho-thirty until upside-down question mark. Sombreros at the door. Arrrrrrrrrooo!	Bambi, I'm gonna put my e-foot up your ass.	Your place.

No-b-t with the la-b-di-b-es...	That secret language was so lame.	I've done nothing. I mean I did learn another language, but it was just that one where you slid a "b" sound in the middle of every single word, and I was never fluent.	First of all, don't lump me in with you, because I'm a surgeon, I'm married, I've had sex while playing Frogger and I'm gonna be a dad. I'm moving through my list.	I'm afraid of dragonflies. You know what, I'm not gonna make a big deal out of this. Neither one of us has made any headway with our lists.
You wrote a time of death.	It's a slow day in the morgue, nothing's written in stone.	Doug, I told you to stop pre-tagging patients.	Oh, we didn't, his vitals are fine.	When did we lose Mr. Heath?
Get out of here!	I wrote one-ish.	You wrote a time of death.	It's a slow day in the morgue, nothing's written in stone.	Doug, I told you to stop pre-tagging patients.
Carla, at 6:41 tomorrow evening I turn thirty. I have to find one thing on this list I can do by then.	Why are you so pissy?	Get out of here!	I wrote one-ish.	You wrote a time of death.
Haven't you used that joke like, a trillion times?	Maybe you could swing by our parts department and pick up a pair of testes.	Carla, at 6:41 tomorrow evening I turn thirty. I have to find one thing on this list I can do by then.	Why are you so pissy?	Get out of here!
Why is everybody wearing wetsuits?	You're not serious about this, are you?	Well, I didn't know anything about cereal-inventing either, Carla. And yet if it wasn't for a harshly-worded cease and desist letter, we'd all be eating J.D.'s Bananas and Nuts.	Oh, you don't know anything about triathlons!	That's it! I'll do the triathlon!
That's a dangerous topic, talk to Carla.	Can I talk to you about Jake?	Well, my bike is rusty, I haven't been able to feel my genitals since they first touched water, and the only thing I've had to eat all day is half a jellyfish. Why are you here?	How's it going?	As I reached the biking stage and finally realized what chafing was, I got a surprise visitor.
Oh, thank God, I think the bike part is finally over. Oh no.	See you, buddy!	Agh! It's like pedaling in hummus!	Why don't you just try a higher gear?	Talking to you violates the two most important tenets of our relationship. One, keep discussions superficial and two, no talking while my boys are straddling chrome. That one's new.
Elliot, you know our rules.	This Jake thing is still really bothering me.	Oh, you're real. Although the dolphin costume is a little odd.	Hey, J.D.	They already finished and cooked a pig?
This is working.	Yeah, I've been thinking about that. Who wants to have a superficial friendship? And, God, do you remember how close we used to be? Dealing with Dr. Cox,	Elliot, you know our rules.	This Jake thing is still really bothering me.	Oh, you're real. Although the dolphin costume is a little odd.
Well, if he freaked you out, why don't you and talk to him?	Not for me, I want to be able to tell you that my boyfriend really freaked me out.	This is working.	Yeah, I've been thinking about that. Who wants to have a superficial friendship? And, God, do you remember how close we used to be? Dealing with Dr. Cox,	Elliot, you know our rules.
All right, fine, Elliot. You want to know why? You're just like me. You're scared because you feel like you haven't accomplished anything with your life. But instead of running a triathlon, you're pushing forward with a guy you don't belong with. And you know as well as I do that one of these days, he's going to open up a bottle of white wine for you when you really prefer red, except you never told him that and you want to know why? It's because he's not right for you, Elliot. Are you happy now?	I don't know. You tell me.	Well, if he freaked you out, why don't you and talk to him?	Not for me, I want to be able to tell you that my boyfriend really freaked me out.	This is working.
Must. Finish. Race.	You're pretty smart for a guy running in bike shoes.	All right, fine, Elliot. You want to know why? You're just like me. You're scared because you feel like you haven't accomplished anything with your life. But instead of running a triathlon, you're pushing forward with a guy you don't belong with. And you know as well as I do that one of these days, he's going to open up a bottle of white wine for you when you really prefer red, except you never told him that and you want to know why? It's because he's not right for you, Elliot. Are you happy now?	I don't know. You tell me.	Well, if he freaked you out, why don't you and talk to him?
A wise man once said the human spirit can overcome any obstacle.	By my watch, you've got eight minutes to finish this thing. Come on!	Oh, great. Then we'll be two losers under one roof.	Why don't you just move into my place?	Elliot, I'm thirty years old. I'm single, I'm homeless, and I'm pretty sure I just soiled myself.
Whips?	No.	Did it involve chains?	Nope.	Mm-hmm. Will you tell me what Jake's fantasy was?
Candle wax?	Mm-mm.	Whips?	No.	Did it involve chains?
Role-playing?	No.	Candle wax?	Mm-mm.	Whips?
Lasers?	No.	Role-playing?	No.	Candle wax?
Good job, man. What did you say?	Nailed it! Hell yeah!	Seeing an intern tell someone they're going to die for the first time is strange. Because even though it's a horrible and sad experience, if they get through it, there's a sense of accomplishment.	Check it out. Keith's telling Mr. Morrison about his brain tumor.	I miss having you as my roommate, I don't know!
Ooh!	Well, I just told him that there's nothing more we can do right now.	Good job, man. What did you say?	Nailed it! Hell yeah!	Seeing an intern tell someone they're going to die for the first time is strange. Because even though it's a horrible and sad experience, if they get through it, there's a sense of accomplishment.
"Nothing more we can do right now" implies that there maybe something we can do tomorrow.	What?	Ooh!	Well, I just told him that there's nothing more we can do right now.	Good job, man. What did you say?
Did you know cowboys used to curse?	Deadwood?	Deadsies.	What was the middle one?	Yeah, I'm gonna need you to go back in there and use some form of the word "die." Dead, dying, deadsies, deadwood. Your choice.
Fine. Let's do this. Wheels up.OK, come on Dorian. Find your center. Round the rosy! Hey! I got it! I don't got it!Whoa. Whoa. Reel it in, Take it clockwise, fight your fear!Come on. Come on. Be the chair. You gotta want it Johnny D! You gotta want it! Woooooo!!	Careful, you're about to let Dr. Cox know you were a gymnast in high school.	Unfortunately for you guys, I have the balance of a...	Same way we have for years.First one who falls introduces Kelso.	How do we handle this?
You know, Laverne, I'm a doctor. So I'm not really gonna take my psychological evaluations from someone who dispenses them in between watching "Maury" and eating a corn muffin.	The hell he does. I remember a flu epidemic. He lost half a dozen children in one day. Hmm!The second Kelso's foot hits the bottom of those stairs, he doesn't have a care in the world.	Everyone has a human side, Coxy. Even Kelso.	You go do that, and I'll go find God, quit drinking, get in touch with myself emotionally and we'll meet right back here at half past impossible. OK?	I'll just say something nice about him that's actually true.
Laverne, I...	OK, that was too mean. Apologize.	You know, Laverne, I'm a doctor. So I'm not really gonna take my psychological evaluations from someone who dispenses them in between watching "Maury" and eating a corn muffin.	The hell he does. I remember a flu epidemic. He lost half a dozen children in one day. Hmm!The second Kelso's foot hits the bottom of those stairs, he doesn't have a care in the world.	Everyone has a human side, Coxy. Even Kelso.
I was watching CNN earlier. Apparently the terror alert in your armpits has been elevated to orange. Oh, no he didn't. Yes, Laverne, he did.	Ah, the hell with it. She's not gonna forgive you, go for broke!	Laverne, I...	OK, that was too mean. Apologize.	You know, Laverne, I'm a doctor. So I'm not really gonna take my psychological evaluations from someone who dispenses them in between watching "Maury" and eating a corn muffin.
Well, I know a lot.	"Laverne, I'm a doctor." You're a bit of a know it all, aren't you?	I was watching CNN earlier. Apparently the terror alert in your armpits has been elevated to orange. Oh, no he didn't. Yes, Laverne, he did.	Ah, the hell with it. She's not gonna forgive you, go for broke!	Laverne, I...
Mark Felt, the F.B.I. guy. That's been all over the news for months.	Yeah? Who was Deep Throat?	Well, I know a lot.	"Laverne, I'm a doctor." You're a bit of a know it all, aren't you?	I was watching CNN earlier. Apparently the terror alert in your armpits has been elevated to orange. Oh, no he didn't. Yes, Laverne, he did.
That's because there's no such thing.	Oh, sorry, rich boy. My TV doesn't get the news. Just the bible channel and some kind of Chinese boxing. I bet you don't know how to play Jiggly Ball.	Mark Felt, the F.B.I. guy. That's been all over the news for months.	Yeah? Who was Deep Throat?	Well, I know a lot.
I knew if I just followed Dr. Kelso around for a little while, he'd eventually do something decent. I'm a master of stealth. I could sneak up on anybody.	Ha ha! I knew you didn't know.	That's because there's no such thing.	Oh, sorry, rich boy. My TV doesn't get the news. Just the bible channel and some kind of Chinese boxing. I bet you don't know how to play Jiggly Ball.

Sir, aren't you being a little paranoid?	Why are you following me?	I knew if I just followed Dr. Kelso around for a little while, he'd eventually do something decent. I'm a master of stealth. I could sneak up on anybody.	Ha ha! I knew you didn't know.	That's because there's no such thing.
When did you get an earring?	I was in Nam, you know. They pulled off my fingernails.	Sir, aren't you being a little paranoid?	Why are you following me?	I knew if I just followed Dr. Kelso around for a little while, he'd eventually do something decent. I'm a master of stealth. I could sneak up on anybody.
I've got to get an earring.Turk, have you heard of Jiggly Ball?	Enid, I'm not cheating on you, this earring is mine.See?It's a hip-hop world, son. Keep up or get out of the way.	When did you get an earring?	I was in Nam, you know. They pulled off my fingernails.	Sir, aren't you being a little paranoid?
I've heard of it, too. It's so awesome that we've both heard of it.	Yeah, it's a game the orderlies made up.	I've got to get an earring.Turk, have you heard of Jiggly Ball?	Enid, I'm not cheating on you, this earring is mine.See?It's a hip-hop world, son. Keep up or get out of the way.	When did you get an earring?
See? These are chest hands.	I have to handle this on my own, OK?	OK, keep going, I enjoy it, actually.Ah, I'm only two and a half years away from chest hands.	Buttery!	Job back.It's just a beautiful film. Beautiful. Corn?Oh, let me help you. I got it.You're tickling your hands. Wait, stop, you're tickling your hands.
Course, yours would be brown.	That's what I'm talking about.	See? These are chest hands.	I have to handle this on my own, OK?	OK, keep going, I enjoy it, actually.Ah, I'm only two and a half years away from chest hands.
Get off.	I like this. It's an idiot handle.	Do you remember earlier when I told you I'd never heard of Jiggly Ball? I was joking. I play all the time.	No, I'm busy cleaning.That one always kills.	Can I talk to you for a second?
Just say no!	As it happens, we're heading out right now to play some Jiggly Ball. Are you in?	Get off.	I like this. It's an idiot handle.	Do you remember earlier when I told you I'd never heard of Jiggly Ball? I was joking. I play all the time.
Even if he's too proud to show it.	But when all is said and done, I like to think he does care a little.	Still, I also know that I wouldn't want to have to make any of the decisions that he makes.	I'd like everyone to welcome back Dr. Reid.	As far as Bob Kelso goes, I know some of the good things he does are for the wrong reasons.
He's married, so it's strictly procreation sex! His wife's throwing her legs up in the air because they're trying for a boy....Like Jesus.	Awww, sex time, people!	That's how he likes it.	Hallelujah! A brother's 'bout to have some sex. Ha-Ha-Hallelujah! A brother's 'bout to have some seeeeeex! Smack the money maker! Smack it!	I'm not sure why it was suddenly so awkward, but I wish something would break the tension.
It's never easy to tell a family that medicine isn't working.	Newbie, let's go, Mr. Donnelly's test results are in.	No I'm not. Stop doing that. Peanut butter egg dirt!	I knew you would. You're very predictable.	I'll do it.
Let me feel my feelings, Turk! We worked on this!	J.D...	Ar you actually complaining about getting to have sex? Because that is so insensitive, Turk.	Ugh. Dammit, I've gotta go have ovulation sex again.	Pie.I've got to find an improv class that doesn't meet in the back of a pie shop.
Mark my words, when that little bastard is dipped in water, I will be there.	That's not where the baptism is, but nice try.	Noted. That was quite a fight you had with your sister yesterday. Won't it be a little awkward when you show up at St. Mary's cathedral on the corner of Maple and Pine, right across from Temple Oheb Shalom at 4 PM today?	Never. Say that. Again.	Morning, sunshine!
You don't have to rub it in her face.	Anyway, I just invited Paige to come by, Mr. Donnelly's labs came back. It looks like the steroid is finally working. If you happen to be keeping score at home, that would be Medicine: 1, God: 0.	Mark my words, when that little bastard is dipped in water, I will be there.

Actually, there was.	Yeah, and I don't have to stick Dr. Kelso's stethoscope down my pants every morning, but I still do. Now isn't there some other relationship out there you could be trying to fix?	You don't have to rub it in her face.	Anyway, I just invited Paige to come by, Mr. Donnelly's labs came back. It looks like the steroid is finally working.

I hope I can find a way to connect with him.	Well, come on. Let's grab some boxes and get to moving, huh?	Nobody seems to.	I don't like that.	Morning, sunshine.
You're welcome, friend.I gotta say, you've got a lot of Asian art around here.	Thanks for saving that. That's one of my favorite pieces.	I hope I can find a way to connect with him.	Well, come on. Let's grab some boxes and get to moving, huh?	Nobody seems to.
Doesn't sound crazy at all.	When I was kid, I always thought I'd travel the world, you know? So after college, I went to China. Did all the normal touristy things, I saw the Great Wall, ate the food, had a baby with a local. You know, just the regular stuff. Anyway, I guess I decorate my place this way because it reminds me of a more optimistic time. That probably sounds crazy.

Thanks, pal.	OK. Time to move some of the heavier stuff. So you might want to put on these gloves. And the attic upstairs has a lot of fiberglass in it. So here's a hat.	We're as thick as two thieves in a pod.	Well, what doesn't kill you...	Long story short, after confirming it with my bunk mates, that counselor and his "friendship lotion" were transferred out of our cabin and we never spoke about it again.
I figured out why I'm so great at managing relationships. I don't rub things in people's faces.	Sure, bud.	Thanks, pal.	OK. Time to move some of the heavier stuff. So you might want to put on these gloves. And the attic upstairs has a lot of fiberglass in it. So here's a hat.	We're as thick as two thieves in a pod.
...I'll end up robbing an Asian couple's house.	Who are you?	And I've always known that if I make the slightest gesture of friendship to a difficult coworker...	Angry sex is awesome.	I never go to bed very, very mad.
Well, seeing as he gave me the strength to outrun the Sheriff's K-9 unit, I'd say he's my new god.You can rub mine's belly if I can rub yours.	My boy in a dress. Who's yours?	Hey, who's your friend?	And two, whether some relationships were beyond repair. Then fate threw me another curve.	Gizmo.
These are coasters.	Really. How do you explain these photos of you whining and crying as you run away from the Kwan's apartment?	I don't whine or cry.	I wasn't talking to him.	He seems fine.
You turned me into a felon!	My camera's broken.	These are coasters.	Really. How do you explain these photos of you whining and crying as you run away from the Kwan's apartment?	I don't whine or cry.
No, thank you. If there's one thing I learned from this guy, it's that I need to stop trying to fix people's relationships.	You know what, there, Newbie? You can go to the baptism. Take Jack. Jordan will kill me if he's not there. Plus, I know you. You're exactly one watered-down appletini away from trying to fix my sister and me.	You turned me into a felon!	My camera's broken.	These are coasters.
Still. I've never know you to judge a person based on their beliefs. In fact, you're pretty tolerant of everyone. Except Hugh Jackman.	You're welcome.	No, thank you.

...gender...	Does what hurt?	For doctors, pain is complicated. Every patient handles it differently, depending on their race...	Hey, check this guy's chart out. He says he's been in pain for, like, three months.	Again.
...or even their sex life.	Ow! I just bit the inside of my lip! Agh! Nothing's ever hurt so badly!	...gender...	Does what hurt?	For doctors, pain is complicated. Every patient handles it differently, depending on their race...
And since there's no way to truly gauge how much pain someone's in, we have to rely on an archaic chart.	OHHHHHH....yeah, that feels good.	...or even their sex life.	Ow! I just bit the inside of my lip! Agh! Nothing's ever hurt so badly!	...gender...
Sorry, thought you were dozing. The thing is, guys, it doesn't matter if he's a homeless guy or some senile old racist.	Hey!	OK, my bad, so we're not crystal clear on the ground rules. OK, tomorrow it will be the last one to touch my face. Nah, I'm not gonna like that. The last one to touch my bot No, that's probably illegal. I tell you what, I'll just email everyone. That's what I'll do. This day and age that's what you do. OK, over here. Guys, Mr. Jenkins spent all night without being treated. Now, I know he's homeless and smell's like an obese man's twosie.

So let's take care of him like he took care of our nation. Get out of here!That's how you light a fire under their butts, Perry, you get 'em going with some inspiration!
Because they're stealing all of our jobs, Mr. Bursick, stealing all of our jobs. Perry, we've spent an equal amount of time on Mrs. Wilk, and seeing as we're both attendings, i.e. equals, why don't we let her decide who her doctor is, huh?	Dr. Dorian, why do I hate all	and *I* treated her last night.	Interesting, seeing as *I* admitted her	Because she's my patient.
Oh, right, your imaginary warning light. Don't be mad, Perry, this day was bound to come. See, I've studied you. I've taken your best qualities and my best qualities and I've combined them into something even better. Much the way that iced tea and lemonade were joined to become an Arnold Palmer. Incidentally, has anyone ever done less to become famous? I mean, yea for me, I mixed two drinks together.	Uhh, Newbie...	Oops. This one's actually from my Aunt Judy and her lady friends. Must have grabbed the wrong card.	"Happy Anniversary, gals?"	Hellooo! If you're wondering what a thank-you-for-being-my-doctor card from Mrs. Wilk looks like, it looks a little something like this.
I'm sure he has lots of hobbies, Perry. The man's a drink mogul.	Arnold Palmer is a golfer.	Oh, right, your imaginary warning light. Don't be mad, Perry, this day was bound to come. See, I've studied you. I've taken your best qualities and my best qualities and I've combined them into something even better.

Uhh, Newbie...	Oops. This one's actually from my Aunt Judy and her lady friends. Must have grabbed the wrong card.
Do you have any family, Mrs. Wilk?	In a hospital, even the best of moods can be ruined by somebody handing you a chart.	I'm sure he has lots of hobbies, Perry. The man's a drink mogul.	Arnold Palmer is a golfer.	Oh, right, your imaginary warning light. Don't be mad, Perry, this day was bound to come. See, I've studied you.

Look, Mrs. Wilk, you have something called systemic amyloidosis. Now, it's in your liver now, but eventually it will shut down all your organs. There's a treatment, but it's very invasive, and at best, it'll just give you a little more time.	No. I was married twice. Divorced one, the other one died. Wrong one died.	Do you have any family, Mrs. Wilk?	In a hospital, even the best of moods can be ruined by somebody handing you a chart.	I'm sure he has lots of hobbies, Perry. The man's a drink mogul.
Say no more. I'm gonna take amazing care of you.	Well, I've had a great life son.	Look, Mrs. Wilk, you have something called systemic amyloidosis. Now, it's in your liver now, but eventually it will shut down all your organs. There's a treatment, but it's very invasive, and at best, it'll just give you a little more time.	No. I was married twice. Divorced one, the other one died. Wrong one died.	Do you have any family, Mrs. Wilk?
Watch out for colon darts.	I've made the first incision. I'm going in.Nurse! Hat!Colon. Why did it have to be the colon?Removing the golden tumor.Ladies...They knew the risks.	I always wondered what exploratory surgery was like.	OK. Elliot turfed this chronic pain patient to me. I have no idea what's wrong with him, so I have to do exploratory surgery.	Pretty crappy. I just had to tell an old lady she's dying. How about you?
Vampire doctors? How did he hear about my screenplay?	Aww, either your picture didn't come out, or we got a hospital full of vampire doctors.	I gotta get Mrs. Wilk back.When did we have a shade remote? I didn't know we had shade remotes.	Now I'm going to check on Mr. Jenkins, your war hero. I feel he, too, deserves a competent doctor. In fact, I'm gonna take all of your patients, and consequently, your only reason for getting out of that lacy, over-pillowed, four poster virgin cocoon you call a bed every morning.	I find this highly unprofessional.
He's both. And at the very end, I'm gonna put "Dr. Acula" across the screen, take that period, get it out of there. Squish it together, it'll say "Dracula"	So Dr. Acula is a doctor *and* a vampire?	That's what they call me. How you doing?The end.	Right away, Dr. Acula.	Ms. Brooks, your blood work looks fine. But I'd like to take one more sample. Just for me.You know, you taste a little anemic. Get that down to the lab, buddy.
Um, thank you for telling me what I already know, Turk.	That is an awesome ending!	He's both. And at the very end, I'm gonna put "Dr. Acula" across the screen, take that period, get it out of there. Squish it together, it'll say "Dracula"	So Dr. Acula is a doctor *and* a vampire?	That's what they call me. How you doing?The end.
She said "I've lead a great life." And every doctor in the world knows that's code for "I'm ready to die."	I heard Mrs. Wilk gave you the axe.	You just lit your pipe on my title page.	Hey, sport!	AHH! My screenplay!
OK, there's no way to answer that and not get in trouble. Change the subject.	How old do you think I am, Dorian?	She said "I've lead a great life." And every doctor in the world knows that's code for "I'm ready to die."	I heard Mrs. Wilk gave you the axe.	You just lit your pipe on my title page.
Really.	I'm fifty-seven, numb nuts.	Jambalaya.	You think I'm that old?	You're seventy-eight, sir.
Who?	I know they say fifty-seven is the new forty.	Really.	I'm fifty-seven, numb nuts.	Jambalaya.
Brookstone? Were you looking for gadgets, sir?	But lately it seems all people see when they look in my direction is some old guy. Hell, just last week I was in the mall hanging out in Brookstone's and some kid asked me if I was lost.	Who?	I know they say fifty-seven is the new forty.	Really.
Oh.	If that's what you trolling for mall ass, then yeah.	Brookstone? Were you looking for gadgets, sir?	But lately it seems all people see when they look in my direction is some old guy. Hell, just last week I was in the mall hanging out in Brookstone's and some kid asked me if I was lost.	Who?
Jambalaya!	How old do you think I am?	You're welcome. You got a lot of pluck for an older gal.	Yes, you were. Thank you.	I knew there was only one way to make the guilt storm go away.Mrs. Wilk, I'm sorry.Mrs. Wilk, I just wanted to say I was wrong to think that you wouldn't want to try every possible treatment there is, to avoid, you know, the place. You know, there's clouds and...Space Needle...Seattle.
Really? You've been spending a lot of time treating my guy, Mr. Jenkins, right?	Of course it took the incompetence of a bewildered jackass to make that error to begin with. Never make assumptions based on your own perceptions. Just never do it.	Thank you.	Say, Newbie. I uh, I gotta hand it to you. It took the heart of a lion to apologize to Mrs. Wilk like that.	The important thing is to regain the respect of your peers.
Yeah, actually he's just a homeless guy. I made up the war veteran story to motivate my boys. But, what are you gonna do?Oh, come on, you've gotten me like a hundred times. I finally got you once. It was bound to happen, right?	Yeah, he's a Vietnam veteran. He deserves as much.	Really? You've been spending a lot of time treating my guy, Mr. Jenkins, right?	Of course it took the incompetence of a bewildered jackass to make that error to begin with. Never make assumptions based on your own perceptions. Just never do it.	Thank you.
What's red for?	That's Julian. Watch it, wet paint. Kelso's starting a new line system to help people get around. Green's gonna go to the smoker's lounge, blue to the ICU, and yellow to all the exits.	We didn't exchange pleasantries.	Was his name Julian?	Where was I?You're not aware of any sort of odd, underground canal system beneath the hospital, are you? I think I saw a manatee.
OK, I'm here. What's the emergency Keith?	Sneaker painting.	What's red for?	That's Julian. Watch it, wet paint. Kelso's starting a new line system to help people get around. Green's gonna go to the smoker's lounge, blue to the ICU, and yellow to all the exits.	We didn't exchange pleasantries.
They're the exact same thing. Every doctor here knows that. Why would you page me?	Uh, do you want Mr. Fleming on unfractionated or low molecular weight Heparin?	OK, I'm here. What's the emergency Keith?	Sneaker painting.	What's red for?
Ever since her fellowship, Elliot loved that her interns saw her as an endocrinology expert.	OK, rock-tors. That's my name for doctors who rock. Next patient.	Good page, good page!	He sneezed and all his surgical staples popped out!	Done, and I am outta here.Dammit!Keith, you've got to stop paging me for totally unimportant things!Ohhh! That man's chest cavity is completely open. I can see his heart beating.
No.	Did you eat my mango body butter?	I didn't know what I was high-fiving, I gotta stop doing that.	You're going to high-five that? Bi-hig mistake.	Here's some!
Right, and where do we meet up in heaven?	Because you think I'm going first because of my diabetes.	Just try to imagine what they're going through. I mean sometimes I think about what it's gonna be like when you die.	Thank you! Now how do I tell those people to let their so go?	OK, I'll help.
I'll see you there, player! I love religion. The point is, Turk, if someone tried to pull the plug on you without being totally honest with you, you know where they'd end up?	At the milkshake pool on the lesbian cloud.	Right, and where do we meet up in heaven?	Because you think I'm going first because of my diabetes.	Just try to imagine what they're going through. I mean sometimes I think about what it's gonna be like when you die.
Next to the super-high, unreachable cupcake table.	In hell, watching The View.	I'll see you there, player! I love religion. The point is, Turk, if someone tried to pull the plug on you without being totally honest with you, you know where they'd end up?	At the milkshake pool on the lesbian cloud.	Right, and where do we meet up in heaven?
Can you press "lobby," please?	After trying to get out of the hospital vertically, I decided to go the horizontal route: hiding in a body bag.	Next to the super-high, unreachable cupcake table.	In hell, watching The View.	I'll see you there, player! I love religion. The point is, Turk, if someone tried to pull the plug on you without being totally honest with you, you know where they'd end up?
OWW!! OWW!! OWW!!! DOUG! Why are you hitting me?!?	GYAAAAAHHHH-DAH!!!	Can you press "lobby," please?	After trying to get out of the hospital vertically, I decided to go the horizontal route: hiding in a body bag.	Next to the super-high, unreachable cupcake table.
Then why were you hitting me?!	Because I thought you were a dead guy coming back to life!	OWW!! OWW!! OWW!!! DOUG! Why are you hitting me?!?	GYAAAAAHHHH-DAH!!!	Can you press "lobby," please?
No, no! Elliot, I'm not even supposed to be here, I'm going home!	There, you are. Come on.	Then why were you hitting me?!	Because I thought you were a dead guy coming back to life!	OWW!! OWW!! OWW!!! DOUG! Why are you hitting me?!?
All right look. What's the leading differential in an obese woman suffering from amenorrhea and hirsutism?	Hmm.	Wha-? You are good.	Hmm.	Still, I love it when Bonds wins at the game that he plays. Look, Elliot, you know how people become specialists? They obsess about the material over and over again until it becomes lodged into their brains. That's exactly what you've been doing. Watch, where's the closest page you've hidden around here?
Oh come on, Turk, it was just a joke. And I only wore it for one week.	Yeah, he was so attached to that thing. He used to wear a bracelet that said "Sasha Forever."	Oh, don't be such a baby, it's a magnetic image. I apologize, Mr. Foster, I'm a little upset. My scooter, Sasha was assassinated this morning.	Is this gonna hurt?	There was a wall! What's the matter with you?Who is still shooting? She's down!It's over!
Now let's fire this baby up.OK, so I still wear the bracelet.	Whatever.	Oh come on, Turk, it was just a joke. And I only wore it for one week.	Yeah, he was so attached to that thing. He used to wear a bracelet that said "Sasha Forever."	Oh, don't be such a baby, it's a magnetic image. I apologize, Mr. Foster, I'm a little upset. My scooter, Sasha was assassinated this morning.
A lot of weird things can happen in a hospital. Like Doug not getting a dead body out of his bed before rigor mortis sets in.	Whatever you say, doc.	Good news, Mr. Foster. The radiologist said your scan is completely clear, but we'd like to keep you here for a few more tests.	Be specific.	Were they D's?
Something feels pinchy. WHOA! AAH! WAAAH!! AAAAHH!!	The lobster's in the pot! Devour! Devour!	Can opener!	Anytime, buddy! Anytime. Wait for him, wait for him.	Thanks for inviting me over, Janitor.
Well, there would probably be some kinks to work out initially.	Looking good, Mr. Henderson. Looking real good, Nurse Meyers.Uh-oh, he's flat-lining! Body, come!Dammit! Starting CPR.Oww!	Yeah, I'd spend the money researching how to successfully separate my head from my body. That way I could literally be in two places at once.	Here we go.	Me? Floating-Head Doctor.
And there it was. Hope. Dr. Kelso's inability to deal with hunger was legendary. We were as good as home.	Good lord, Bobbo, was that your stomach?	OK. Just back away slowly.Oh no, Turk. They're organized!AAAHH!!	J.D...Dude?	This is where Sutton lives, right? Let's get in there.
Oh, thank God.	Oh! Dude, don't sweat it. It says here that the ostrich is generally a docile creature.	Wooohhh!!	J.D., J.D., uh, J.D.!	Here comes your vanilla bear!
What?! I'm coming back up!Turk?WAAAAHHH!!Mr. Sutton, I hope this isn't a bad time.	It also says their kick can kill a man.	Oh, thank God.	Oh! Dude, don't sweat it. It says here that the ostrich is generally a docile creature.	Wooohhh!!
Mr. Sutton, I cured you and you never thanked me.	That's Leon. Loves car rides. Likes to stick his head out the window and I tell him it's a little too dangerous, but he doesn't listen to me.	Oh.	I did escape. There was one waiting in the car.	You OK? Did you try and escape?
I do admit, he looks pretty phat in your Kango.	Don't move.	Ruh-roh.	Uhh..	I just don't see why it's such a big deal for you to say, "hey, doc..." Why did he just walk away like that?
Sticks and stones may break my bones!	Two good reasons. His face and his personality.	Oh, thank you, but I'm not big on blind dates, and I know, I haven't hit it in awhile, but there's good reason for that.	Oh, you're such a nice young man. I'd love to set you up with my grand-niece.	Well, Mrs. Nichols, it was an honor being your doctor.
Anyway, for me to be set up with your niece, I'd need to know a lot more about her.	But words will hurt forever.	Sticks and stones may break my bones!	Two good reasons. His face and his personality.	Oh, thank you, but I'm not big on blind dates, and I know, I haven't hit it in awhile, but there's good reason for that.
My blind date should be here any second. I gotta thank Mrs. Nichols for setting this up.Oh, Mrs. Nichols, you blue-haired bitch! Wait, she's veering off. Phew!OK, Mrs. Nichols, your new hip is on the house because this girl is amazing! Yet there's something accessible about her. I wonder what it is.	She's single.	Anyway, for me to be set up with your niece, I'd need to know a lot more about her.	But words will hurt forever.	Sticks and stones may break my bones!
So, she was a bit of a klutz.	Ooh, I'm gonna have the carrot cake.	My blind date should be here any second. I gotta thank Mrs. Nichols for setting this up.Oh, Mrs. Nichols, you blue-haired bitch! Wait, she's veering off. Phew!OK, Mrs. Nichols, your new hip is on the house because this girl is amazing! Yet there's something accessible about her. I wonder what it is.	She's single.	Anyway, for me to be set up with your niece, I'd need to know a lot more about her.
No.	Did you see that? Please say no.	So, she was a bit of a klutz.	Ooh, I'm gonna have the carrot cake.	My blind date should be here any second. I gotta thank Mrs. Nichols for setting this up.Oh, Mrs. Nichols, you blue-haired bitch! Wait, she's veering off. Phew!OK, Mrs. Nichols, your new hip is on the house because this girl is amazing! Yet there's something accessible about her. I wonder what it is.
So do you wanna see if they'll give us more coffee or do you just want to call it a night?	Sometimes.	Me too! Do you ever, like, drift off and have weird fantasies?	I ride a scooter, I love Harry Potter so much I sometimes wish I was a wizard, and I've hated sports since I was a kid.	From that moment on, it was the greatest date ever. We had so much in common.
Unlikely! Because what's waiting for me in my room is what's known in football terms as a slam dunk .	Twenty bucks you blow it in less than five minutes.	Ha! Why don't you ask her if our date sucked. She's in my room.	So, I guess your date sucked, huh?	My roommate. Back in one second.
You're telling me what to say, next you're gonna be telling me how to kiss her. I mean, where does it end?	So, you got the second date. Just don't repeat the same mistakes you made with me. For instance, don't speed down the road and pretend your brakes are out. I don't care if it got you laid once in high school. It is not funny, and I still have not forgiven you for killing that family's pony. But most importantly, if you ever find yourself in a romantic situation again, ignore whatever pops into your head. Just look into her eyes and say these exact words: I'm. So glad. I found you.	Isn't she great?	Bye.	It does, it happens.
Looking at her, I knew what the future held for Julie and me.	Really? While I was in the bathroom, I wrote my name on the mirror with my finger so the next time you took a hot shower and it fogged up, you'd think that ghosts where trying to tell you to be with me.	Nah, while you were in the bathroom I set the clock two hours ahead so you'd think time was just flying by.	Seriously?	I am having so much fun hanging out with you. Can you believe we've been talking for two hours?
OK, romance is in the air. You gotta say something. Tell her about the hit and run. Nah, she probably loves ponies. Ask her if she's been tested. Why are all these odd thoughts popping into my head? My, God, look at the size of her feet. Tell her! Stop it! OK, the silence is going on too long. Just say that thing that Elliot told you, even though it's stupid.	That's so sweet! So what do you want to do now?	Thanks for doing that.I wanted a picture of us old, you know? That way if one of us dies in a tragic skiing accident, we'll always have that memory of us together.	Oh, God this mask is hot.	Smile.
Why should I believe you?	Don't do this, you're going too fast.	You're not broker of the year Whit Prowdy.	J.D., this is a mistake.	Which consists of two shares of Eastern Airlines stock and a pack of unopened Les Mis trading cards.
I hate you, Whit Prowdy.	Because honesty is my business.	Why should I believe you?	Don't do this, you're going too fast.	You're not broker of the year Whit Prowdy.
Hi.	The Morgans on the other side were much friendlier. But I don't think we're gonna have them over again.	OK! Hey, Buzz, I'm gonna beat you in poker next time!	Go to hell!	Hey, Clarks!
Throwing in a crib.	I'll throw in a crib.	I'm sorry, no thank you.	No.	Oooh, sweetie!
You OK, buttercup?	It didn't matter, because I was happy to look out at my beautiful half-acre with my sweet, but klutzy gal.	Throwing in a crib.	I'll throw in a crib.	I'm sorry, no thank you.
Turk and I had discovered a new way to deal with Kelso's bad moods.	The glass broke in my mouth.	You OK, buttercup?	It didn't matter, because I was happy to look out at my beautiful half-acre with my sweet, but klutzy gal.	Throwing in a crib.
Don't tell them, in case you want it later!	What?	I almost bought a baby yesterday.	I just got my period.This really sucks. I've been trying to get pregnant for two months now.	It usually bought us a few minutes of peace. But then Carla said something that deeply disturbs every man on God's green earth.
Hey, Mickhead!	Hey, guys.	You know who else is a great rebounder? Dr. Mickhead.His wife was killed on Saturday.	It's a basketball thing, I'm a great rebounder.	What's Glass Man?
He's still a person of interest.	The police cleared him yet?	Hey, Mickhead!	Hey, guys.	You know who else is a great rebounder? Dr. Mickhead.His wife was killed on Saturday.
That's why they call him the glass man.	Wow. She looks like a young Carla.	Yep, there was eye candy for all. And only one thing could upset this delicate balance.	Would you guys stop doing that?	And for the men, there was a new, sexy Latina nurse: Nurse Martinez.
I forgot, sometimes Turk is slow. You know what? It's time for her to meet the people in my life. I think she's gonna do great.	I don't understand.	I'm saying all my thoughts out loud so I don't mess this relationship up.	What are you doing?	Do I want her to meet Turk this soon? What if he doesn't like her?
Doesn't it bother you that she never laughs at anything?	Dude, Julie's awesome.	Yeah.	That's so funny!	Ha! We'll get you ladies some more coffee. Jordan, if you're willing to pay for it, just sit there frozen. How very generous.
I mean when something's funny she never laughs. She just says "that's so funny." It's kind of annoying.	What do you mean?	Doesn't it bother you that she never laughs at anything?	Dude, Julie's awesome.	Yeah.
The only jerk around here is the spicy marinade on this Jamaican chicken, mon.	Nah. You're not gonna be a jerk and do something like that, are you?	They're crazy about you. They're worried I'm gonna mess this whole thing up.	So your friends really like me?	I gotta get cooking. People are going to be here for this barbeque any second.
It is, Julie, it it is. Why do you always do that?	That's so funny.	The only jerk around here is the spicy marinade on this Jamaican chicken, mon.	Nah. You're not gonna be a jerk and do something like that, are you?	They're crazy about you. They're worried I'm gonna mess this whole thing up.
Well you never laugh when something's funny. You just say "that's so funny."	Do what?	It is, Julie, it it is. Why do you always do that?	That's so funny.	The only jerk around here is the spicy marinade on this Jamaican chicken, mon.
But how can you guarantee that she's going to laugh at this movie?	It's called immersion therapy. What we're about to watch is going to make her say "that's so funny" so many times that eventually it's not going to bother you anymore.	All right. Why are we watching a movie again?	I'll go make some more.	You OK, sweetness?
I don't know. I mean, we already got the half-acre, right? And I imagine we'll eventually be able to build a house on it, and a little backyard, room for a slip and slide for our kids, Gilligan and The Skipper. I know, I'm sorry, I gotta do it, I lost a bet to Turk. And I don't want to rush things, but I feel good about this. I don't know, I feel like you and I could go the distance.	So what do we do now?	You know what? I really couldn't care less.	That's so funny! I'm sorry I said "that's so funny," I know that drives you crazy.	Ha ha. One-a-day vitamins. I'll tell you how they could double their profits: Two-a-day vitamins.
Oh. Tapas.	Um, actually I meant what do you want to order from take-out for dinner?	I don't know. I mean, we already got the half-acre, right? And I imagine we'll eventually be able to build a house on it, and a little backyard, room for a slip and slide for our kids, Gilligan and The Skipper. I know, I'm sorry, I gotta do it, I lost a bet to Turk. And I don't want to rush things, but I feel good about this. I don't know, I feel like you and I could go the distance.	So what do we do now?	You know what? I really couldn't care less.
Great for sharing.	I love tapas.	Oh. Tapas.	Um, actually I meant what do you want to order from take-out for dinner?	I don't know. I mean, we already got the half-acre, right?

I love it. Just share and...	Sharing is fun.	Great for sharing.	I love tapas.	Oh. Tapas.
So you really don't think about that kind of stuff?	Share.	I love it. Just share and...	Sharing is fun.	Great for sharing.
You know what? We've just started dating, so I have a feeling this conversation goes down a really bad road. Why don't we just say we're never going to talk about it ever again, OK?	J.D., I'm only 23, and I don't even know if I want any of that stuff, and certainly not for the five or ten years.	So you really don't think about that kind of stuff?	Share.	I love it. Just share and...
OK.	OK.	You know what? We've just started dating, so I have a feeling this conversation goes down a really bad road. Why don't we just say we're never going to talk about it ever again, OK?	J.D., I'm only 23, and I don't even know if I want any of that stuff, and certainly not for the five or ten years.	So you really don't think about that kind of stuff?
OK. So you really feel that way?So here I am again. I can't believe I broke up with her. Why do I keep doing this?	OK. Whew.	OK.	OK.	You know what? We've just started dating, so I have a feeling this conversation goes down a really bad road. Why don't we just say we're never going to talk about it ever again, OK?
It was August! The weather was far from frightful!	J.D., this was totally different. You didn't break up with her because she said "that's so funny," or because she was like Mini McSkinny and singing Christmas carols in the summertime.	OK. So you really feel that way?So here I am again. I can't believe I broke up with her. Why do I keep doing this?	OK. Whew.	OK.
Put a blankie on him.	He's gone fetal again.	Where's Rex?	After six months on the job, some interns can become completely overwhelmed.	Damn those roller blades. OK, everybody, let's gather round.
Unfortunately, young Keith had become competent so quickly that every word out of his chiseled mouth came tainted with an arrogant smugness that he couldn't hide no matter how hard he tried.	I've got it!	Put a blankie on him.	He's gone fetal again.	Where's Rex?
Right on cue.	Is there anything else I can do, Dr. Dorian?	Unfortunately, young Keith had become competent so quickly that every word out of his chiseled mouth came tainted with an arrogant smugness that he couldn't hide no matter how hard he tried.	I've got it!	Put a blankie on him.
Those, Jason, are the panicked scratches of the adolescent raccoon. Though until animal control can get into my home, it's currently residing in my sock drawer.I got this! Start it, Grandma!	Dr. D, what's on your back?	You think you're better than me? With your rock-hard abs, and your dynamite areolas? You're not.	Dr. Dorian, take my shirt.	No, Keith. All I need right now is a sip of your coffee to make me feel warm in my belly.Aww, Keith, look what you did!
You can't stop, can you?	I don't feel like I am.	Keith, it's like you're begging me to hate you.	You OK, Dr. Dorian?	Ugh.
We were both a little edgy because our favorite patient, Mrs. Wilk, had developed a lung infection and needed to be intubated for a week. So basically, we had to put her in a coma. Of course, at her age, there's always a chance that she'll never wake up.	Newbie, today!	You can't stop, can you?	I don't feel like I am.	Keith, it's like you're begging me to hate you.
All right.Ahh! Uhhg! Ahh! Uggh!I feel so close to you right now.HOOOOO!!	Why wait till later?	Maybe later, you can show me where else you're pierced.	Mmhmm.	Thanks for penciling me in.
Hmm.	Ha! Yeah.	Oh, I do love that show. It's like they've been watching our lives and then just put it on TV.	J.D., I really don't want to do this. Can't we just go home and put on our PJ's and watch Grey's Anatomy?	After paying the Janitor the unreasonable sum of $90 to move my bed back home......Elliot and I decided to round up out interns to pick out our respective booty calls.Welcome to Fugly-ville.
I'd appreciate it if you did.	J.D., he's just a booty call. Say the word and I'll end it.	I gotta tell you, I can't stand that guy.	I said no cream.I didn't say no cream. It's like having a sex puppy. What's your problem?	"El Toro Grande?" I'm not familiar with this brand.No change. Her FiO2 is still 50%.
All right, the real reason I brought Mr. Joy up here was for a teaching exercise. Can anyone figure out what the cause of death may have been?	Now I have to take him back down to the basement and I don't even have my gurney. I hate dead people.	Doug, I left a note on the decapitated guy's stump that I would have him back by two. It is 1:45.	There's Mr. Joy. J.D., did you steal him from the morgue?	Oh, way to get to know your patients, there, murderer.
What did you say Keith?	Maybe when you leaned over to check his IV, you smothered him with one of your love handles.	All right, the real reason I brought Mr. Joy up here was for a teaching exercise.

Doug, I left a note on the decapitated guy's stump that I would have him back by two. It is 1:45.
Well, I'm not.	Dr. Reid told me that if you picked on me, I should stand up for myself. And that you're very sensitive about your doughy physique.	What did you say Keith?	Maybe when you leaned over to check his IV, you smothered him with one of your love handles.	All right, the real reason I brought Mr. Joy up here was for a teaching exercise. Can anyone figure out what the cause of death may have been?
You know, Keith, I think out of professional decorum, we should refrain from talking about Dr. Reid. He's boinking her, everyone. That's why he gets special treatment. What did she say to do if I said that?	Please, no one help. He's not heavy at all.	Well, I'm not.	Dr. Reid told me that if you picked on me, I should stand up for myself. And that you're very sensitive about your doughy physique.	What did you say Keith?
Around here it can feel like good things never happen.	Dammit, I had been stung by a jellyfish!	I am ashamed of you, OK, do you know petty it is to get that personal?Once, when we were dating, Elliot asked me to urinate on her.	Well, if the pear-shaped shirt fits, wear it!	Doughy physique, Elliot? Doughy physique?
I was going to miss Turk but luckily, my favorite intern was around to cheer me up: Jason Cabbagio. Or as I had brilliantly nicknamed him...	OK.	Totally.	Uh, you OK with us not hanging out for a couple of weeks?	And it was at that moment that Turk and I remembered the incident we managed to block out for 12 years.
I know that, but I've nicknamed you "Wolfman" because of your keen sense of smell.	Well, my last name is Cabbage.	Oh, no Mark, I wasn't talking to you. I was talking to Cabbage.	Yes, sir?	Cabbage!
Now, what can I do you for?	And your ridiculously hairy torso.	I know that, but I've nicknamed you "Wolfman" because of your keen sense of smell.	Well, my last name is Cabbage.	Oh, no Mark, I wasn't talking to you. I was talking to Cabbage.
Well, yes and no, mostly no, really - really, all no. But don't worry, I got your back. First thing is, take a little nipper yourself.Oh, got some on you, look out! OK, that's some of the fun that you can have, but no , seriously watch and learn, watch and learn.	Dr. D, is the IV supposed to leak like this?	Now, what can I do you for?	And your ridiculously hairy torso.	I know that, but I've nicknamed you "Wolfman" because of your keen sense of smell.
Take it all in, Cabbage, take it all in.	It's an honor to watch you work, sir.	Well, yes and no, mostly no, really - really, all no. But don't worry, I got your back. First thing is, take a little nipper yourself.Oh, got some on you, look out! OK, that's some of the fun that you can have, but no , seriously watch and learn, watch and learn.	Dr. D, is the IV supposed to leak like this?	Now, what can I do you for?
You're late, Keith! Which doesn't surprise me because you're a bad person.	Yes, I like some interns more than others, but I never let my personal feelings affect my professional behavior.	Take it all in, Cabbage, take it all in.	It's an honor to watch you work, sir.	Well, yes and no, mostly no, really - really, all no. But don't worry, I got your back.

Lies will get you nowhere, Keith.	Sir, they needed help with a shooting victim downstairs.	You're late, Keith! Which doesn't surprise me because you're a bad person.	Yes, I like some interns more than others, but I never let my personal feelings affect my professional behavior.	Take it all in, Cabbage, take it all in.
That could be anyone's blood.	I'm covered in his blood.	Lies will get you nowhere, Keith.	Sir, they needed help with a shooting victim downstairs.	You're late, Keith! Which doesn't surprise me because you're a bad person.
Oh, is it, Keith?	My gift is in the same vein.	Winner!	Oh, J.D., this is so sweet.	Mrs. Wilk, I remembered how much you like basketball, so I got you a DVD of the NBA's "All Time Greatest Centers of All Time" signed by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
Well, I can't just pick one of them out to torture.	Bethany. Focus.	What did you think of the Transylvania dream sequence? Because I wrote it while I was on call, and the next morning I woke up and read it and I was like "what was I thinking," you know?	I've seen that kid. Horrible doctor. I would sooner leave my medical care in the hands of Dr. Acula. Yes, I read your screenplay and as much as it pains me to say it, I didn't hate it. All right, lookit, here's what you gotta do with this Keith. You turn the heat up on his ass, and sooner or later he'll make a mistake and then you bounce him the hell out of here.	I'd sit with my interns, but Keith's over there and I can't stand him.
Actually, just this morning, one of them had trouble with an IV. Yesterday, one of them made a diagnosis off a backwards X-ray, and last week one of them make a patient septic when he confused a suppository with a Mike & Ike.	Then dump on all of them. I'm sure they deserve it, I mean let's face the facts. You are their teacher, how competent can they be?	Well, I can't just pick one of them out to torture.	Bethany. Focus.	What did you think of the Transylvania dream sequence? Because I wrote it while I was on call, and the next morning I woke up and read it and I was like "what was I thinking," you know?
When you get a chance, I'd love to talk to you more about the screenplay.	Stellar group there, Newbie, let the torturing commence.Oh, I'm sorry, that means conversational time is o-v-e-r. Please exit the area. Please exit the area. Please exit the area.	Actually, just this morning, one of them had trouble with an IV.

I'll add some milk. Thank you. See?	It's a little hot.	I think I know how to deal with people, Carla. Check this. Cabbage, heat test!	Wow. You know, Dr. Cox told me you were getting tough on your interns. I had no idea you were gonna go all cotton ball on their asses.	Uh- oh, Keith. It looks like someone's gone prematurely gray. That's gonna hurt with the ladies.
And now, it's goodbye, Keith.	Yeah.	I'll add some milk. Thank you. See?	It's a little hot.	I think I know how to deal with people, Carla. Check this. Cabbage, heat test!
Thank you. So as I was saying, my sad faces...	Return this pen or die painfully.	Please? I'm in the middle of a very threatening speech.	Not going to happen. I had to strangle a nurse to get this clicky-top.	Interns, gather! The next intern who screws up is going to be suspended for two weeks! This is a list of all of your names. At least the ones I remember. At the end of each day, I will either write a smiley face or a sad face next to your name. One sad face and you are gonzo, and I want to warn you, I write my sad faces pretty darn sad. Allow me to demonstrate. Dr. Cox, may I borrow your pen?
Oh, I don't have it.	That's Keith? That kid's the best intern we've got. Hell, I'd like to bronze him and turn my office into a Keith-edral and convert to Keith-stianity. F.Y.I., I still want my pen back.	No, I drove Cabbage out. That's Keith.	Why? You got what you wanted, you drove Keith out of here.	Nah, I'm just kind of sad about my intern.
What's not over?Do you know what's not over?	You damn sure better find it, Newbie, and when you do, I want it buffed, shined and de-nerdified.You think that's funny? This isn't over.	Oh, I don't have it.	That's Keith? That kid's the best intern we've got. Hell, I'd like to bronze him and turn my office into a Keith-edral and convert to Keith-stianity. F.Y.I., I still want my pen back.	No, I drove Cabbage out. That's Keith.
You get in there!	That's OK, Dr. D.	Cabbage is back! Gang, I should have made it clear, earlier. The suspension policy begins today at 4PM. So, my apologies to Cabbage.	And now, to take care of my boy.	You're gonna be an awful father!
Let me explain something to you, Keith, OK? I treat each and every one of you like unique individuals, OK? Take Gloria, for example, she's 400 years old. She needs to sleep a lot. I work around that schedule.Wolfman has gotta be home by daybeak, so he does all of his work come nightfall. Crazy Barry. Not allowed near children. We work around that.	This is totally unfair! If I had messed up, I'd be gone.	You get in there!	That's OK, Dr. D.	Cabbage is back! Gang, I should have made it clear, earlier. The suspension policy begins today at 4PM.

Not everyone's last name lends itself to a nickname, Keith.	How come I don't get a nickname?	Let me explain something to you, Keith, OK? I treat each and every one of you like unique individuals, OK?

that nickname will never stick. It's too long.	And, you're done. So, you accidentally drummed your friend out of here because you were trying to eighty-six the Dudemeister, eh?	You see, Dr. Cox, I treat each and every one of my interns differenly...	Ruh? Why is that screw-up still here?	Those are beautiful antlers.
Oh, he's good, Keith. Really good.	Yeah! There! Tell him I'm good!	Oh!	Oh, really?	Hey, Todd. My buddy, Keith, here, says you're no good at rat-tailing.
I was in the Porsche. I had never made it into the Porsche. It smelled like German heaven. I wasn't gonna blow this opportunity. I had to be careful about every little	Come on, I'll give you a ride. Let's go.Can you believe the huevos on that Hedrick? Holy cow, it's like we've never had a patient die on us before. Uh, I gotta put this bag in the trunk.	Oh, I tried to, Perry, but I'm having some scooter trouble.	Hey. I thought you went home already.	I was hunting for bigger game.
Oh, we should probably go.	Actually, this is a support group for the terminally ill.	Yeah, is that what it is?	All right, Lester! We are having this out, right here, right now!Oh, for the love of God. What is this, some pansy, get-in-touch-with-my-feelings-because-my-mommy-didn't-love-me group?	Yeah, you're right. Still a little sticky. Not yet ready for passengers.
We were definitely in the depression stage. And bless Hedrick, he didn't say it. All he said was...	She's gone.	We'd been there before when someone died. But this felt different.	Should be any minute now.	And that was the moment it got real for Elliot.And for Dr. Cox and me.
Letting go is never easy.Whether it's letting go of the leverage you had over your boss...	She was lucky to have you two as doctors.	We were definitely in the depression stage. And bless Hedrick, he didn't say it. All he said was...	She's gone.	We'd been there before when someone died. But this felt different.
Thank you!	Hey, nice new watch, J.D.	That's the rhododendron, Keith, everybody knows they smell like pie when they bloom.	Does it smell like pie crust?	Keith didn't know I mildly disliked him. He also didn't know I was rubbing Crisco on his back.
Come in, brown bear.	It wasn't a watch. Now that Elliot had gotten serious with Keith, I needed to get tighter with Turk. And since he's so busy being married and trying to have a baby, I had only one option.	Thank you!	Hey, nice new watch, J.D.

Awesome, check this.	Dude I can't.It's baby-making time. How's it going with Keith?	Right on. Hey, what are you doing, man? I'm about to take out the slip and slide. Let's do it.	Hey, Gizmo.	That's not my handle.
Mrs. LeVinne has dementia, Rex, and I know she loves sweets. So take the pill, put it in some raspberry jam, put it on your finger, dip it in her mouth, helloo!	Uh, Mrs. LeVinne won't take her medication.	Yes, Rex?	Dr. Dorian?	It's just too much. Sorry, I switched places so I could go again.
Because your voice is always higher when you're nude.	Yeah! How did you know?	No problem, brown bear. Are you nude right now?	Hey, Gizmo, can you check on Mr. Jensen for me?	It really is unfair, you guys!
Or not.	Why didn't you stand up for me?	I was just glad to watch TV and for once, not be in a world of crap.	Ohhh....	You firing blanks, buddy?
I can't believe you're ready to have kids. We spend all day taking care of old people, washing them, cleaning them, why would you want to bring that home?	If I ever have kids you are never allowed to babysit.	Well, you're in luck. This happens to be my specialty. Here's some tips. If you can't get over the fact that you're doing it to yourself, sit on your arm until it falls asleep, then pull it out and use that. I call it "The Stranger."	You know I'm not comfortable getting busy with myself.	Of course, buddy.
All right, fellas, two quick announcements! First of all, whoever's been filling up my Tivo with JAG reruns, let's cut it out. Secondly, Harvey, no matter how drunk you get, I like to sleep alone.

Congratulations!	Hey! I'm not sterile!	All right, if you like him, I like him.	Thanks again, Dr. D.	You're right, Lisa, it is too late, because from now on, I'm going to be handing out all the case assignments. For instance, this cool case right here.Should I give it to the most annoying intern? Because that would be you, Lisa. Or maybe I should give it to the most incompetent intern missing a finger, because that would be you Rex. Or maybe I should just give it to the best intern, which would be you, Keith.Now if anyone wants to tell on me, to whomever they like, they can. Good day.Here you go.
My friends were all happy. And even though I felt like the fifth wheel, I could take solace in something.	Turk's not sterile!	Congratulations!	Hey! I'm not sterile!	All right, if you like him, I like him.
Oooh.	That, and your amazing ability to switch back and forth seamlessly between male and female genitalia.	Sometimes you gotta go the extra mile with patients. That's what makes me such a special doctor.	My job is to make sick people better, not to help Bernie in there score a slice of Episcopalian tail on opening night.	Why didn't you just read lines with the old guy?
Personally, me, I believe that medicine is about more than just treating the disease. You gotta be there for people. Take Mrs. Cohen, right? When she broke her hip I treated that, but she had also left her car double-parked, so being an "extra mile" kinda guy, I went and took car of it.Sorry. It's been a little while since I drove stick.I wonder how she got out of that truck. That's how she broke her hip.	Newbie, snap out of it. I don't have time for your daydreaming.	Oooh.	That, and your amazing ability to switch back and forth seamlessly between male and female genitalia.	Sometimes you gotta go the extra mile with patients. That's what makes me such a special doctor.
Well, right after I got your test results back, I got on the horn with your dad and we started a phone tree to find everyone. There were some tears, mostly mine, but we got it done.	Larry? Dad? How...?	All right, team, let's stay close. Come on. Carol! Look who I found!	Get a load of Mr. Extra-Mile-Guy's leukemia patient sitting there all by herself. Knowing him, he's probably out getting her a cake shaped like a cancerous white blood cell.	I hoped you learned something today.
Hear that, Perry? I'm the most amazing doctor because I went the extra 5280 feet. What's that? That's right, it's a mile. And how does that make me feel? Keith!Thank you.	You are the most amazing doctor.	Well, right after I got your test results back, I got on the horn with your dad and we started a phone tree to find everyone. There were some tears, mostly mine, but we got it done.	Larry? Dad? How...?	All right, team, let's stay close. Come on. Carol! Look who I found!
Plus, the girl I'm dating is totally into my hair.	Mm.	I'm hiding. I really don't want to be bald. I have a sneaking suspicion it won't work for me. It think it might accentuate my spoon chest.	How's that leukemia patient of yours doing?	I don't think it's funny.
That was a long time ago. Maybe you should listen to me for once.	No you don't. You don't have to go the extra mile. That's what I've been trying to tell you. What the hell happened to the days when you used to listen to me?	There is, even if she won't admit it. You know what, I'm stuck, man. I have to shave this down.	No, there's nothing else.	I'm sure there's something else she's into.
Thank you.	Not in this lifetime. Listen, Newbie, you're not a completely terrible, horrible, incompetent doctor and while I would never let any of my blood relatives be your patient, if it was someone that I knew, an acquaintance, I might be OK with you treating them.	That was a long time ago. Maybe you should listen to me for once.	No you don't. You don't have to go the extra mile. That's what I've been trying to tell you.

Nice.	Oh. Second, I got a job.	Oh no, that's Nana.	Dude! There you are. Two things, first, the aliens are here and they're wearing track suits.	Date time.
Woo! Ah. Where were we?	And if you hadn't pushed me to do all of that extra mile stuff, that probably wouldn't have happened. So, thank you. You got a hottie waiting for you at the bar. You go get her.	Nice.	Oh. Second, I got a job.	Oh no, that's Nana.
That's one of my conditioners, yes.	Do I smell banana conditioner?	Woo! Ah. Where were we?	And if you hadn't pushed me to do all of that extra mile stuff, that probably wouldn't have happened. So, thank you. You got a hottie waiting for you at the bar. You go get her.	Nice.
AAHHH!	As great as this was, I couldn't stop thinking about what Turk said and howWhoa, this girl really digs hair. The point is, it's hard getting what happens at the hospital out of your head.	That's one of my conditioners, yes.	Do I smell banana conditioner?	Woo! Ah. Where were we?
We're not buying it, are we gang?	And I really was a world-class hurdler.	Ohh...	I I didn't sleep with Amy Carter. We did everything but.	No. No more. Here are some of the lies you've told us over the last five years: You went to Harvard. You have a wife who only has a pointer and thumb-pinky. You have a a brother-dad, a mother-sister. You have two kids, no wait, you have one kid, no wait, you had a baby with a Chinese local, you're a deaf-mute, oh wait, now you're telling us that you're a world class hurdler and you slept with the beautiful and irreplaceable Amy Carter?
The people have spoken. Allow me to bask in the glow.	No, nah, heck no...	We're not buying it, are we gang?	And I really was a world-class hurdler.	Ohh...
Not now, Turk, I'm glow-basking.	Oh-ho! J.D., guess what?	The people have spoken. Allow me to bask in the glow.	No, nah, heck no...	We're not buying it, are we gang?
Great, I'll tell everybody. You find Carla. Dr. Cox	I'm in!	This won't be indoors, Turk, and there certainly won't be all those people throwing bird seed. Why were people throwing seed? It's a the point is that you, my friend, have a chance to be on the greatest surprise a husband has ever pulled for his wife. And you get credit for it the length of your entire marriage.	Are you forgetting what happened when you made me have doves at my parents' anniversary party?	Wait, Turk! When has a man ever been able to tell his wife that she's pregnant? Allow me to paint you a picture with my imagination brush, OK? You two come out in the parking lot where all Carla's friends have gathered. They're holding a giant banner that says "Carla, you're pregnant, and I dove you." Did I say "dove?" I did, Turk. That's when I cue the bird-wrangler who releases 500 white doves into the air. Where do they land? I don't know. But one thing Carla knows is that in her uterus is a little, soft, baby Turk.
Really? Baby.	Oh, no problem.	And Elliot, if you see Carla, don't get emotional.	Fine.	Can you just please not tell Carla?
It would take a very clever plan to hide this tiny, penny-like sensor on him.	You should put the hide and seek sensor on him. That way you'll always know where he is.	Yeah, I pissed him off earlier today. How am I supposed to avoid him?	Hey, what's up with the Janitor? He seems a little more lurky than usual.	I already have a grandma.If I get one this little, everyone's gonna think I'm gay.Aw, look at this fellow. Come here boy, I got a little hard candy for you.Yes, you're a good boy. You got a candy you can unwrap in a movie theater!I'd name him Sebastian.
What are you going to do?	I'm going to bed.	Spilled mine, too.	I spilled mine, too, honey. You know what you should do? Ask for some of J.D.'s.	I felt like Turk was starting to blame me for all of this.
Wait, Turk! I have an idea.	I'm gonna go tell her the truth and hope that she's so tired from being pregnant that she doesn't have the strength to kick my ass for more than a few hours.	What are you going to do?	I'm going to bed.	Spilled mine, too.
It's a good 'un.	You have another idea, huh? I gotta tell you, I'm done with your ideas. And not just for now, but forever. OK, are we clear on that?	Wait, Turk! I have an idea.	I'm gonna go tell her the truth and hope that she's so tired from being pregnant that she doesn't have the strength to kick my ass for more than a few hours.	What are you going to do?
OK, we need Carla to find out she's pregnant on her own and we need your help. Can we count on you?	I'm listening.	It's a good 'un.	You have another idea, huh? I gotta tell you, I'm done with your ideas. And not just for now, but forever. OK, are we clear on that?	Wait, Turk! I have an idea.
Uh, she went up to the roof to get some air.	Where's Carla?	Actually, I need to come with you.	OK. That was right.	You go left.
Follow her. Lock her up there.	Oh.	Uh, she went up to the roof to get some air.	Where's Carla?	Actually, I need to come with you.
Hello, Janitor, waiting around the corner to grab me.	You got it.	Follow her. Lock her up there.	Oh.	Uh, she went up to the roof to get some air.
I'm holding a GPS warning device that goes off whenever you come within a hundred meters of me. It's responding to a tiny sensor in your stomach.	How'd you know that was me?	Hello, Janitor, waiting around the corner to grab me.	You got it.	Follow her. Lock her up there.
You'll never get anywhere near me.	I knew that wasn't a penny.	I'm holding a GPS warning device that goes off whenever you come within a hundred meters of me. It's responding to a tiny sensor in your stomach.	How'd you know that was me?	Hello, Janitor, waiting around the corner to grab me.

The only thing left to do? See.	Oh, we're gonna see.	Yeah, we will see.	We'll see.	You'll never get anywhere near me.
We'll see.	You're going to pay.	The only thing left to do? See.	Oh, we're gonna see.	Yeah, we will see.
OK, bye.	No time.	We'll see.	You're going to pay.	The only thing left to do? See.
As I lay there, watching Nurse Roberts hammer-throw 23 pounds of high end fruit my way, I could take solace in one thing.	He's 100 meters away, and it's going to take him at least ten seconds to change those batteries. That's not even a world record pace. Ready, set, go.Time!Still got it.	I was a little anxious because it was tie to change Mr. Beeper's batteries. All clear to the left, all clear to the right. You can do this.	Hey. Dr. Dorian, I got those batteries you asked for.	I don't know, I'll have someone from the psych ward check her out.
Any second now, Carla and Turk were coming to tell me they were pregnant. Carla had to believe that I was truly surprised.I was the lynch pin of our plan. Showtime.	We're having a baby!!

What's the scoop? I would have no clue what it could be.	Hey, J.D. We have such big news!	Any second now, Carla and Turk were coming to tell me they were pregnant.

Oh boy.	What do you mean "when Turk first told you?"	Carla, when Turk first told me, I	Now give them the ten minute emotional roller coaster ride that is the speech you've been practicing all afternoon.	Oh!
What would you have thought of doves?	Uh...We've known for a day. That pregnancy test you took yesterday was positive.

Um, Mr. Coleman, the hepatitis is doing a number on your liver. You're obviously very jaundiced...yellow! Oh, mellow yellow, I get it, that's funny! You know, I never knew what that song was about. Now I now I finally get it. Liver disease. Anyway, we're going to give you suppressive therapy and do everything we can to make sure you don't need a liver transplant, OK?	They call me mellow yellow.	Praise be to Krishna! Dammit.Hey, Mr. Coleman, how are you feeling?	Good morning, Dr. Dorian.	After our tambourine jam they gave me some literature, but I'm not the type that's easily sucked in by that stuff.
All right, see you, Mr. Coleman.	OK.	Um, Mr. Coleman, the hepatitis is doing a number on your liver. You're obviously very jaundiced...yellow! Oh, mellow yellow, I get it, that's funny!

He was a genius.	If I'm not careful, they'll put me in the pun-itentiary.	Marc was a stand-up comic on a cruise ship.	Hey, somebody order a liver? Ha ha ha! Uh oh. Jello? Jello? Is this thing on?	The amazing thing about livers is that a healthy person can actually have part of it removed and give it to somebody else. For Frank, that person was his brother, Marc.
A brick house!	What?	I do, Carla. I'm building something.	You better have a reason for taking my man's badonka-donk donk.	I didn't either. Hey, Turk, if you ever donated a body part to me, you know which one I'd want?Hey, thanks for the butt, playa!
Turk, are you sure this isn't offensive? It doesn't look like anybody else is wearing a costume.	When have I been a bad wingman?	You mean we are off. I changed my schedule which means I have Thursday nights off which means we are going out which means you are going to be my wingman. Even though you're horrible at it.	Dude, four more hours and I am off.	You know, you could be a dynamite center square.
All right.	Buddy, relax. These are my guys, all right? As long as you're with me, they're going to find this funny.	Turk, are you sure this isn't offensive?

Wooo! Ahh!	My bad, my bad.	Wazzup!Waaaah!!	That looks like Talia.	All right.
Every time I saw them they yelled out "cracker." How did they know I love crackers?	That that wasn't Talia.	Wooo! Ahh!	My bad, my bad.	Wazzup!Waaaah!!
And I will see you later.	Good luck.	We'll be rooting for you.	All the best.	Good luck fellas.
Nice save.Krishnas.	If you ladies remain in this area, we'll bring back drinks.	And bowled a gentleman's 40. Now, who wants to help me off with my shoes? I forgot to wear socks.I'm losing them.	That's how we do!	It's great. You surround yourself with some new friends. You say one clever thing and you're in. Watch this. You guys, let's tally it up, gather round! Whoa, Carol! 180, amazing! Lisa, you had a 125. Turk, 192!
Unfortunately, things weren't going as well for Marc.	Thanks.	You look great, man, I'm glad.	I feel I feel great.	Look at you, man, you're color's back, there's no sign of infection.
Sometimes that's the way life works. The ones who do the nice things suffer the most. Whether it's giving up Turk Night for a friend...	He's hypertensive and tachycardic.	Unfortunately, things weren't going as well for Marc.	Thanks.	You look great, man, I'm glad.
...was it worth it?	He's bleeding out. Prep the OR. CAN I HAVE THE CRASH CART IN HERE!!	When you're the one paying the price it can really make you wonder...	Hi!Oh, come on!	...or agreeing to be the bad guy for your boss.
What?!	They're with Dr. Cox. Apparently he's mentoring them and talking to them and stuff.	You're going. Where are the interns?	You know what? Thursday night might not work for me.	Sounds hot. Hey, we're going out Thursday, right? Because I went online and got a magic eight-ball bowling ball. Check this: Are the ladies going to love this? "Ask again later?" Oh, I'm just kidding, it says yes.
Oh, that's perfect.That's perfect. You know what, take it!Maybe you can use it with Rex, or Gloria, or that guy.	What pencil?	No! Zip it! I am so G-darn pissed right now. I was OK when you kept me at an arm's length because everybody said "that's just Cox. That's how he operates." And I believed them. Now I walk in on this. This bi-racial love fest? You know what? I hate to do it, but I'm giving you back the pencil. That's right. The pencil you gave me on my third day of work. You handed it off to me like a like a tiny yellow baton. Like you were trying to say to me "J.D., you are the new me. You, J.D., are my mentee. You are my son."	Newbie...	Oh. My. God.
Heh. His name is Leslie. His name is Leslie. You're name is Leslie. All right, good for you, Leslie.LESLIE!	That guy's name is Leslie.	Oh, that's perfect.That's perfect.

He's a dynamite tailor. Not sure why he's here.	For the last time, it's Americo. And of course I love it. I made it!	Well, who cares, Lonnie. Because all that really matters is whether or not America loves it.	We don't love it.	Thanks for your opinion, Carla. But I'm much more interested in what you all think.
How you doing, buddy?	You better put your scrubs on, Herbert's back.	He's a dynamite tailor. Not sure why he's here.	For the last time, it's Americo. And of course I love it. I made it!	Well, who cares, Lonnie. Because all that really matters is whether or not America loves it.
How you feeling, love bug?	Because of his weight, Herbert was a frequent visitor and no one liked treating him.He wasn't a mean thing. See, with big people, even the simple stuff is more difficult. I didn't mind, because Herbie was my man.	How you doing, buddy?	You better put your scrubs on, Herbert's back.	He's a dynamite tailor. Not sure why he's here.
Herbie, it's not a bath house.We'll get those bandages off later today, Mr. Brooks, all right	Fully loaded. Hey, it's time for my sponge bath, right? I need three girls...	How you feeling, love bug?	Because of his weight, Herbert was a frequent visitor and no one liked treating him.He wasn't a mean thing. See, with big people, even the simple stuff is more difficult. I didn't mind, because Herbie was my man.	How you doing, buddy?
Yes, she was, Dan. Thank you. We'll be right back.	There's no easy way to say this. We've got the crabs.Oh, she was cute.	Life was good, but then came a surprise visit from my brother, and a round of the game he likes to call "Watch her leave."	You look like you need to be rescued.	And just like that, I had the chance to comfort Claire.
What about Tiger?	If we have a boy, we're gonna name him George.	Look, Dan doesn't exactly have the world by the tail, OK? Every time he calls me all depressed, the only thing I can think of to cheer him up was to say "Elliot still digs you." I'm just trying to find a way to make him feel good about himself, you know?	What? I mean it tickles.	Doctor-patient confidentiality goes both ways, Mr. I-Prefer-My-Temperature-Taken-Through-the-Back-Door.
Oh boy.Call Elliot...call Elliot...No. N Call Elliot...got her...	Hey, man, where'd your brother go, anyway?	What about Tiger?	If we have a boy, we're gonna name him George.	Look, Dan doesn't exactly have the world by the tail, OK? Every time he calls me all depressed, the only thing I can think of to cheer him up was to say "Elliot still digs you."

Yeah.	I had a brother once. Well, I shouldn't say once, he's still my brother. My parents adopted him when I was about 12. He was about 46. Actually older than my parents. His name was Cleat. And he talked like this. Howsitgoin? Howsitgoin? Good kid. Did what they said. Make the bed, mop the floor, sweep the lawn, whatever had to be done. Everything was good till he was in his fifties, and then, wow, did he have a midlife crisis. Him and my dad fought constantly. And I mean, really, physically beating on each other. But I don't blame him for it though. I blame my mom for sleeping with him. That's just out of line.	As long as you're not my brother.	Mr. Brooks wanted some safety tips on how to safely operate propane heaters.	Hey, Mr. Brooks, let's get these bandages off you.What are you doing here?
Watch what?	Anyway, the reason I'm telling you this is because your brother told me that if I could keep you focused on me, he would let me watch.	Yeah.	I had a brother once. Well, I shouldn't say once, he's still my brother. My parents adopted him when I was about 12. He was about 46. Actually older than my parents. His name was Cleat. And he talked like this.

But I don't blame him for it though. I blame my mom for sleeping with him. That's just out of line.	As long as you're not my brother.
WAAAAHHH!!	Hey, little brother.	Watch what?	Anyway, the reason I'm telling you this is because your brother told me that if I could keep you focused on me, he would let me watch.	Yeah.
Angie it is.	Yeah!	Me too. Angie, guys?	I love it!	I guess I could help you name her. Let's see. It's a girl hamster, what about Angie?
Wait, Turk, it was an accident, OK? The name just popped into my head!	Hold his arms!	Angie it is.	Yeah!	Me too. Angie, guys?
No! Turk!	Shut up!! You just shut up right now! Pink belly.	Wait, Turk, it was an accident, OK? The name just popped into my head!	Hold his arms!	Angie it is.
Actually, we were. Because the way the whole brother thing works, now that Dan had beaten me up, it was all over.	Hey, man, y'all two OK?	Uh, Turk was so proud of his handiwork that he signed it.I think he knows it's so painful I won't be able to wash it for some time.	The best I could do, man. How's your tummy?	So, Herbert, how you doing with your diet, man?
Or not.	WHY DID YOU LIE TO ME ABOUT ELLIOT?!	Actually, we were. Because the way the whole brother thing works, now that Dan had beaten me up, it was all over.	Hey, man, y'all two OK?	Uh, Turk was so proud of his handiwork that he signed it.I think he knows it's so painful I won't be able to wash it for some time.
Elliot doesn't want to have babies with Keith.	Yeah, what's up?	I do, but I want to talk to you about something.	Hey, Johnnie. Just packing up. Thought you had to work?	Hey, Dan?
When I said Elliot would never be into a guy like you, it's because you're a 35 year-old bartender who still lives in our mother's attic and is showing no signs of changing. I'm not saying this to make you feel bad, Dan, I'm telling you this because I think you have the potential to do whatever you want to do with your life. But you have to actually try.	Huh. Tough break for Keith. You know, I almost had a threesome with that guy.	Elliot doesn't want to have babies with Keith.	Yeah, what's up?	I do, but I want to talk to you about something.
Whether it's a sense of denial......or the fact that you love your son.As for me, I was just happy to get some rest.	Who are we kidding? This is so real now, there's no way we can sleep!	Even though I knew my brother wasn't going to change, Elliot was right. It comes down to what helps you sleep at night.	Don't you have to get back to work?	And then I got the answer I expected.
I think you can do whatever you want to do.	Yeah, I'll keep it. Hey, uh, you think anyone would ever really hire me?	You know what, man, you might as well just keep it.	Hey, Johnnie, is it cool if I borrow this suit? I figured I might wear it to that job interview.	Hey.
I'm making a video postcard. Do you have a message for my mom?	Where the hell have you been?	I even got some great footage of Dr. Cox.	Sorry, the old man stole some ice cream.	It was the perfect idea. She got to meet my superiors.
She had a hysterectomy last month. I'm sure I can just edit over that part.	No, but since she brought you into this world, I have a message for her uterus.Bad uterus! Don't do that anymore.	I'm making a video postcard. Do you have a message for my mom?	Where the hell have you been?	I even got some great footage of Dr. Cox.
Mr. McNair had locked-in syndrome. A paralysis so severe that he could only communicate through a computer that responds to his eye movements.	Let's go see Mr. McNair.	She had a hysterectomy last month. I'm sure I can just edit over that part.	No, but since she brought you into this world, I have a message for her uterus.Bad uterus! Don't do that anymore.	I'm making a video postcard. Do you have a message for my mom?
What?	Newbie!	Now you're being a jerk...jerk...jerk...jerk! JERK!	Oh my God. I get it now. Carol...Carol...Carol...Carol...Carol...	Oh, thank you for asking, Mr. MacNair. You see, the thing about Dr. Cox is the closer he feels to a person, the more he means to push them away. So when he calls me Ava, he's actually saying "J.D., I care about you." Vulnerable people, like...
My bad.I felt bad for Mr. McNair, but I was off until six tonight, so I decided to grab a quick nap in the sun.What the...whoa!	I'm relatively certain the computer is broken.	What?	Newbie!	Now you're being a jerk...jerk...jerk...jerk! JERK!
Even though the Janitor had basically kidnapped me, when he helped me up, I couldn't help but feel there was hope for our relationship yet. I guess being locked up all day really make you appreciate the things that really matter...	Now help him up so he thinks there's hope for our relationship yet.	Cold.	How was your day?	WAAAHHH!
Hey, Rebecca, you got that echinacea for me? Just kidding, you know I think all this stuff is voodoo. Good to see you. Hey, looks like somebody else is sick of that cafeteria stuff, huh?	...Or a smile from the manager of the herbal section.	Lookin' good pal, eggs on top, OK? Eggs on top.	Hey there, Dr. Dorian.	Some doctors like to change into their streets when they go out for lunch. Not me. I like how the world reacts to me as a doctor. Whether it's a friendly greeting from the world's slowest bagger...
A friend dropped me off.EAGLE!Hey, wanna go splitsies on some deli counter meatloaf? I can't finish a whole serving. I mean I can, but I don't like to. It all goes right here.	Aw, now what the hell, do you follow me here?	Hey, Rebecca, you got that echinacea for me? Just kidding, you know I think all this stuff is voodoo. Good to see you. Hey, looks like somebody else is sick of that cafeteria stuff, huh?	...Or a smile from the manager of the herbal section.	Lookin' good pal, eggs on top, OK? Eggs on top.
I don't think there's a security force at...OK, hey fellas.	We've got a grazer.	Security?	Security!	Oh, come on, Rebecca, everybody's doing it.I won't tell anyone if you don't.
Where's the shaving cream, is that aisle two, still?	Ha ha! Wherever you're taking him, take me, too! Nah, you go ahead.	I don't think there's a security force at...OK, hey fellas.	We've got a grazer.	Security?
Mmm.	How weird is it that we're both here two days in a row?	Hey, Jill.	J.D.!	Whoa!
It's not not sad.	I was thinking there might be a 50% chance that the guy who blew me off yesterday just got his days wrong and would be waiting here with roses. Is that sad?	Mmm.	How weird is it that we're both here two days in a row?	Hey, Jill.
That's an awesome story, Jill.	Plus I have the whole day free. My shrink couldn't make our appointment. He found his third wife in bed with his second wife and got so depressed that he downed an entire bottle of his bulimic daughter's Prozac. So now he's back in the hospital.	It's not not sad.	I was thinking there might be a 50% chance that the guy who blew me off yesterday just got his days wrong and would be waiting here with roses. Is that sad?	Mmm.
Having lunch. The cafeteria stinks and I can't go to the grocery store because apparently crazy Jill Tracy lives there. Every time I try and shop she follows me around, like I'm her only friend in the world. It's pathetic.	Dude, what the hell are you doing?	Stay away from my organs!	Because we'll probably just go ahead and sell this one.	Ah, what the hell. I can live with one kidney.
I'll come, too.	I'm gonna go talk to Carla.	Having lunch. The cafeteria stinks and I can't go to the grocery store because apparently crazy Jill Tracy lives there. Every time I try and shop she follows me around, like I'm her only friend in the world. It's pathetic.	Dude, what the hell are you doing?	Stay away from my organs!
She told me.	How do you know all that?	She had been, uh, stood up on a couple dates. And, uh, she hadn't seen her shrink in a while. She was definitely depressed.	She was admitted a short time ago and she hasn't regained consciousness. Tox screen's positive for cocaine.Do you think she could have OD'd?	Sure, what's going on?
Thank you.	You can use her organs.	...It probably means bad news for another.	People, I've got our organs.	...He's probably gay.And if there's good news for one doctor...
No.	Just tell me this: Is there anything anyone could have done?	Thank you.	You can use her organs.	...It probably means bad news for another.
Why?	I saw her in that supermarket, too, but I'm not torturing myself. Would you like to know why?	God, this girl's annoying.	What's that?	You know what I was thinking the whole time I was havig lunch with Jill?
OK, I hear you.	Because she didn't come to the hospital looking for help. We just randomly bumped into her out here in the world. I mean, don't get me wrong, if a guy gets shot, or if he has a heart attack and I am physically the closest doctor to him, I will intervene. But shy of that, you can't. I mean, you just can't. It's too much to ask of yourself.	Why?	I saw her in that supermarket, too, but I'm not torturing myself. Would you like to know why?	God, this girl's annoying.
And because he said that, I knew it wouldn't.	No, you don't. Once you start blaming yourself for deaths that aren't your fault, my friend, that's a slippery slope that you can't come back from. And trust me, I've seen it ruin a hell of a lot of good doctors and I will not let it happen to you.	OK, I hear you.	Because she didn't come to the hospital looking for help. We just randomly bumped into her out here in the world. I mean, don't get me wrong, if a guy gets shot, or if he has a heart attack and I am physically the closest doctor to him, I will intervene. But shy of that, you can't. I mean, you just can't. It's too much to ask of yourself.	Why?
You had to be. The fact is, those people were going to die in a number of hours and you had to make a call. I would have made the same call.	I was obsessed with getting those organs.	I guess that lunch was kind of a one-time thing, huh?There's no way you could have seen that coming. I mean, rabies? Come on, there's, like, three reported cases a year. In fact testing for it would have been irresponsible. You would have wasted time those people didn't have.	No.	Hey. Hungry?
Yes. Now I got us lunch. And I think we should eat it.Right then I knew I was going to pull him out of this. But unfortunately, sometimes the hospital picks a day where it's just going to pile it on.	Yeah?	You had to be. The fact is, those people were going to die in a number of hours and you had to make a call. I would have made the same call.	I was obsessed with getting those organs.

Where are you going? Your shift's not over. Hey! Remember what you told me? The second you start blaming yourself for people's deaths...there's no coming back.	Oh, God. Come on.Clear!Still in V-tach, clear!Come on. VF, Clear!Aw, come on. Come on, Come on! GOD! GOD, GOD!He wasn't about to die, was he, Newbie? Could have waited another month for a kidney.	Yes. Now I got us lunch. And I think we should eat it.Right then I knew I was going to pull him out of this. But unfortunately, sometimes the hospital picks a day where it's just going to pile it on.

Let us not feel sorrow for Bobby Adams. He was 12. He lead a full life. He will be missed, especially by his beautiful wife, Jenny, who stood by him even when he turned 6 and had a midlife crisis and was caught banging one of those naked people who brought us corn.I'd be the oldest man in pilgrim village.	I should tell her about that. The truth is, with modern medicine, 80 isn't that big a deal anymore. It's not like the olden days.	Uh, I would have, Mr. Catay, but Dr. Reid is throwing a huge celebration for you later.	Why aren't you guys making a bigger fuss?	...Or nobody remembering Ray Catay's eightieth birthday.
Turk, you know what bothers me? Dr. Cox shows up to work drunk and we're all acting like nothing happened.	Well, uh, I'll ask Mickhead.	Always pass, sir.	Well, standing invitation, every Thursday.	Pass.
Turk was psyched because orthopedic surgeons are notoriously the most unemotional, jockish surgeons of all.He was finally going to have a boss he could connect with.	I don't know, I kind of feel for the guy. Besides, I am way too excited. I start my orthopedic rotation today. It is going to be awesome.	Turk, you know what bothers me? Dr. Cox shows up to work drunk and we're all acting like nothing happened.	Well, uh, I'll ask Mickhead.	Always pass, sir.
It's short for sensitive guy. Our music is acoustic alternative. We marvel at fireflies. And when we help a drunk girl home from the bar, sure we cop a feel. A feel of her hair as we're pulling it back so she doesn't get any vomit in it.	What's a sensy?	I can help you with Dr. Stone. He's one of my people. He's a sensy.	I'm never gonna get a good surgery on this rotation.	I'm just not down with the whole drinking and doctoring thing, OK? Excuse me.
I did! That was our last year! I didn't what you to get Jagermeister in your corn rows.	I'm having a weird med-school flashback. I think you held my hair back while I vomited.

Dammit.	Basketball.	Hockey?	My Latrell Sprewell phase.	I did! That was our last year! I didn't what you to get Jagermeister in your corn rows.
You're gonna cry in front of him.Laugh if you must, but it'll show him you have emotional depth and it will trigger a nurturing impulse inside him that we sensies can't resist.	What am I gonna do about Dr. Stone.	Dammit.	Basketball.	Hockey?
OK, he's hugging Colonel Doctor, which means you got about seven seconds.	Got it. Knife-wrench! For kids.	No!	Oh, yeah, I forgot all about that crying stuff. I was just...Oh, hey, loose thread.	OK, there he is. You ready?OW! He's the one who needs to cry, you idiot, not me!AAAHHH!!
A good one does. Here's the plan. What you're gonna do is tell him a story that isn't inherently sad. That way, when you get all emotional, he's gonna think you're extra sensitive. At which point, I'm gonna nail you with the menthol and you'll be crying like a ten year old pilgrim widow. Here he comes. And, blacktion.	A hug takes seven seconds?	OK, he's hugging Colonel Doctor, which means you got about seven seconds.	Got it. Knife-wrench! For kids.	No!
Right then I knew what I had to do.	No, J.D., that's what you need. That's what you've always needed. Maybe after five years of working here, that's not such a good thing anymore. I gotta go and do my shift with Dr. Cox.	He's your attending, you have to connect with him. You need somebody you can look up to. Someone you can count on. What you need is someone who will always have your back.	Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. That's it. I'm done. There's no way he and I are going to have a relationship. Not unless I want to bear his seventeenth child.	Good. That gives us time to come up with a new plan.
That's the thing about family. When you fall off the deep end, you can always count on them to rally around you. When you come back, you might get a quick hug, a pat on the shoulder......Maybe just a nod.But no words really need to be spoken. Of course, it's always nice when they are.	Glad you finally shaved.	Ohhh, that's awful.	You don't drink scotch.	Maybe he just needed time to heal, or maybe he just needed to see how much everybody cared but I like to think that it was because of me that he was finally able to say this.
Welcome.	J.D....Thank you.	That's the thing about family. When you fall off the deep end, you can always count on them to rally around you. When you come back, you might get a quick hug, a pat on the shoulder......Maybe just a nod.But no words really need to be spoken. Of course, it's always nice when they are.	Glad you finally shaved.	Ohhh, that's awful.
I know that, Kim. It's a game we play. What's your name? It's Turk. What's that guy's name? I don't know, he's a patient. Looks like a Dave. Are you a Dave? Maybe he's a Dave, we don't know. Hey!	I've been here five years, big guy.	Uh, no, you big knucklehead, I don't. On behalf of everyone here at Sacred Heart, I'd like to say konnichiwa.	J.D., I'm sure you know Kim Briggs.	Hello!
Dr. Feinburg? Anastasia? Gift Shop Girl?	Oh, really? Will all the women in the room who are married, please remove your wedding rings?	Please, T, I'm not that shallow.	Yes.	] Everybody was Kung-fu fighting! Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah!So you're saying because she wears a wedding ring she's invisible to me?
I thought you died.	Hey, J.D.	Dr. Feinburg? Anastasia? Gift Shop Girl?	Oh, really? Will all the women in the room who are married, please remove your wedding rings?	Please, T, I'm not that shallow.
But I sent your family flowers.	Nope. I just got married.	I thought you died.	Hey, J.D.	Dr. Feinburg? Anastasia? Gift Shop Girl?
Gift Shop Girl!	I know. You bought them from me. It was kind of weird.	But I sent your family flowers.	Nope. I just got married.	I thought you died.
Sorry.	What?Stop that!	Gift Shop Girl!	I know. You bought them from me. It was kind of weird.	But I sent your family flowers.
I never got a synchronized snap from the greasers.	Guys, I know everyone gives you a hard time, but trust me. This look is coming back.	She even got along with the greasers.	I just love that every woman knows how to do that.	All the women liked her.
WHAT?!	Mr. Peters, I know that having a gal urologist might seem a little uncomfortable, but the penis is just another excretory organ, so let's go ahead and take the stigma off it. Now this is the length of the average penis.	I never got a synchronized snap from the greasers.	Guys, I know everyone gives you a hard time, but trust me. This look is coming back.	She even got along with the greasers.
No, wait a second, I'm mad at you! You stole my video camera with all the scenes on it from Dr. Acula, the vampire movie I'm making.	Do it, man.	Well, I'll have to come by sometime.	I'm at the Giggle Pit. Every Monday at sunup.	Where do you perform?
I don't know, maybe I was surfing the hospital's website and I saw that someone posted the "Dr. Acula delivers a baby, then eats it" scene? Someone with the screen name "Rotinaj?" Rotinaj is just Janitor spelled backwards, Rotinaj.	Why do you think I stole it?	No, wait a second, I'm mad at you! You stole my video camera with all the scenes on it from Dr. Acula, the vampire movie I'm making.	Do it, man.	Well, I'll have to come by sometime.
Vampires like it windy.	Dr. Acula, don't....stop!	Kim, wait. Unfortunately there's no way I can make you mine. Unless I make you mine...for eternity!	OK. See you J.D.	All right, there's only one problem with this.
Turk! Keys!Yahtzee!Hey, girl. What are you doing? Wanna get some coffee later?	Oh, yeah. She's been divorced for like, over a year. She just wears her ring at the hospital so she doesn't get hit on all the time.	Wait, Kim's single?	And you know how hard single life can be. Just ask Kim.	Relax, brown bear, there's no shame in cry-maxing.
Damn.	What can I say? You got me.	Even if it meant losing respect for someone you thought you might like.	Surgery is really the only thing that has a shot at curing this guy and the reason that she's not going to do it is because he's older and he's got heart issues which makes him high-risk and if he were to drop dead on her operating table, well, that would make her surgery stats go down. And that wouldn't look very good on a young doctor's resume, would it?	Still, it's always good to hear the truth.
Now back to the crux of the matter! Hit her, Per!	Well, it's no secret how I feel about surgeons. I hate them. I would liken them to rocks, but that would be an insult to rocks, because you see, at least rocks are useful to society. We build bridges with them. We throw them at guys who wear those tiny phones clipped to their heads. It's a phone. You can't do this? However...	Oh, my God. Out of here!Dr. Cox, please weigh in.	Actually, I have done that. Everyone has.	Well, my best friend here is a surgeon and he would never pass on a risky surgery just to keep his stats up.
And even more ironic was that it looked like she had.	I'm sorry, Elliot.	The irony was that Keith was yelling at the one woman who was trying to save his relationship.	It was really cool getting to know you, man.	Nobody really speaks to Carla like that.
I finally figured out what bothers me so much about you.	J.D., one second, uh, I'm on the phone with my Mom.She just got her RV fixed. Mom, I gotta go. You can call me from the road.My mom loves the road.	Yeah, well, it's just...	Look who's happy again.	I think Elliot finally seeing who Keith really was made me understand why I was so upset with Kim.
It's the way you're so concerned about protecting yourself. I mean, no one in this entire hospital has a bad thing to say about you, and I'm guessing that's because you're so careful not to rub anyone the wrong way. And you still wear your wedding ring. That prevents any guy from getting anywhere near you. You wouldn't operate on Mr. Peters, and we both know you're protecting yourself there. I don't know, I guess in the grand scheme of things, it's not that big a deal. I just I was a little disappointed to find out how you turned out to be. I'll see you around, Kim.	Well, lay it on me, studly.	I finally figured out what bothers me so much about you.	J.D., one second, uh, I'm on the phone with my Mom.She just got her RV fixed. Mom, I gotta go. You can call me from the road.My mom loves the road.	Yeah, well, it's just...
Oh. Cool.	Because for some reason, I find myself really caring about what you think of me.	Then why did you do it?	No, actually it was a stupid career risk.	I saw you did that surgery on Mr. Peters. Did you decide it was the right thing to do?
Oh, cool.	Ha! Of course. I invented the zoom, zoom, zoom.	You zoom, zoom, zoom?	I'd rather just go out with you. Ohh! Zoom, zoom, zoom!	Hey, Kim, how would you like a night on the town with the hottest doctor in this place?
He said, in front of his future girlfriend.	Well, five times a week, huh? For me that would be cutting back.	Help the poor kid out.	So, Josh, you are suffering from a condition called phimosis. It's basically a hardening of your foreskin. As part of your treatment, I'm going to ask that you masturbate five times a week.	Liar.
That's mine.	See you around six, wear something slutty. Zoom, zoom, zoom.	You know what? I should probably mosey.Looking forward to our date.	He said, in front of his future girlfriend.	Well, five times a week, huh? For me that would be cutting back.
Pregnant witch. Hey, there's Kim. She and Elliot had bonded over their ability to communicate at the speed of light.You'd have to slow it down for humans to understand.	Don't call me Tubby.	Ooh.OWWWW!!	Oh, J.D., come here, I want to you to feel something, quick!	Hey, Tubby.
Bye!	All right, slugger!	Well, trust me, Kim. I've beaten up many nerds in my day. But tonight's about you having the best first date ever.	Well, I'm up for anything. I married my high school boyfriend, so the only first date I ever went on was in tenth grade. I began with me sitting in the backseat of his Miata, because his friend, Benny, called shotgun. And it ends with us going to the arcade, and I quote, to eat pizza and beat up nerds. And I married that guy!	Head loves karaoke.
You had to soil the whole food court thing. It's veal piccata night at Sbarro's!	You don't have anything planned, do you?	Bye!	All right, slugger!	Well, trust me, Kim. I've beaten up many nerds in my day. But tonight's about you having the best first date ever.
Unfortunately, I can't. My deck has sort of become a cruise-in spot for older, gay gentlemen.Get off my deck, you old queens! Go! HEY! Whose is this?!Whose is this? You find somewhere else to hang out! I know for a fact Les Mis is in town!I tried turning my hose on them, but they liked it.	Why not just take her to your deck? You can just lie out, look at the stars?	Yeah, yeah, but except this time with two horses.	Ooh, like you and I did for your birthday.	I have to get ready, man. I want my date with Kim to be perfect. What do you think about a romantic horseback ride on the beach?
I didn't need luck because this was going to be the most romantic date ever.	Well, if anything, good luck, buddy,	Unfortunately, I can't. My deck has sort of become a cruise-in spot for older, gay gentlemen.Get off my deck, you old queens! Go! HEY! Whose is this?!Whose is this? You find somewhere else to hang out! I know for a fact Les Mis is in town!I tried turning my hose on them, but they liked it.	Why not just take her to your deck? You can just lie out, look at the stars?	Yeah, yeah, but except this time with two horses.
No problemo.	Wow, no saddles. Are you sure you're going to be OK riding bareback?	Upsy-daisy.	J.D.! I've never ridden a horse on the beach before!	Your steed, m'lady.
Actually, that's a preexisting condition.	All right, testicular function is normal. OK, one is significantly larger than the other.	Looks like my plan is working.	J.D., I'm a urologist and there's a good chance you have testicular torsion. In which case, you could lose a testicle. So, come on. Off with the pants.	Oh, no, no, no. The date continues.
Yes. Wait, your right or stage right?	So the right one's always been bigger?	Actually, that's a preexisting condition.	All right, testicular function is normal. OK, one is significantly larger than the other.	Looks like my plan is working.
Retract it.	Ugh, let me test the retraction.	Yes. Wait, your right or stage right?	So the right one's always been bigger?	Actually, that's a preexisting condition.
So, you're from Texas, huh? They say that's the Lone Star State. What exactly does that mean?	OK, the date's not going as planned, but you can still save it with your legendary gift for small talk.	Retract it.	Ugh, let me test the retraction.	Yes. Wait, your right or stage right?
And then it happened. Elliot Reid: Moment Killer.	We should.	Well, maybe we should fix that.	Me too.	I feel like we kinda missed first base.
Hey, Kim.	I know. Buck up.	I'm afraid, mocha bear.	All right. There she is. We spent all morning crafting a line so raw with confidence, that if you pull it off you're back in the game.	Sorry.
Well, uh, the swelling's gone down... for now.	Oh, hey, J.D., how are you feeling?	Hey, Kim.	I know. Buck up.	I'm afraid, mocha bear.
Go out with me again tonight.	You're an idiot! Ha ha ha!	Well, uh, the swelling's gone down... for now.	Oh, hey, J.D., how are you feeling?	Hey, Kim.
With who?	Oh, J.D., I would love to, but I'm going to a Neil Diamond concert.	Go out with me again tonight.	You're an idiot! Ha ha ha!	Well, uh, the swelling's gone down... for now.
Thank you.	I haven't seen Keith in a while, so I'm gonna take him instead. Kim's letting me off the hook.	Hey, Kim. What happened to Neil Diamond?	What's up, chicken butt?	Ugh, I hate cleaning up after those messy, old queens.Ooh, appletini. When did they start drinking straight-guy drinks? Mmm. It's fresh.
What's up?	You're welcome.	Thank you.	I haven't seen Keith in a while, so I'm gonna take him instead. Kim's letting me off the hook.	Hey, Kim. What happened to Neil Diamond?
It seems like good friends always come through for you.	Nothing.	What's up?	You're welcome.	Thank you.
OK, you let me know.	Not yet.	OK. I'm cool with that.	Why don't we just hang here and look at the stars until we're comfortable to make out a little?	So what do you want to do tonight?
Cool.	It's yours, J.D.	Uh, Kim, I'm not really sure how to phrase this, so I'm just gonna dive right in: Have there been other penises?	I'm pretty sure.	You're pregnant? Are you sure?
Aaaaauuuuugggggghhhhhh!!!!!!	Are you okay?	Cool.	It's yours, J.D.	Uh, Kim, I'm not really sure how to phrase this, so I'm just gonna dive right in: Have there been other penises?
You know what else is pretty classic when the coffee guy asks for money, you say, "Sorry, my wallet's in my other pair of mocha-chinos." That always gets 'em.	We can get through this.	Well, that's different, Kim, that's hilarious. This is life-changing.	Said the father of my unborn child. Heh!	Yeah. I don't think I've ever seen the inside of your apartment before.
Scone is also a a funny word; but I don't like them, I prefer croissants.	Ah, dammit. I have to go to the hospital.

Well, that's different, Kim, that's hilarious. This is life-changing.
Please! I'll be fine. You be careful you're walking for two!Call Turk.	You're clearly freaking out, so, um, you need to promise me that you're gonna find somebody to talk to about this while I'm gone.	Scone is also a a funny word; but I don't like them, I prefer croissants.	Ah, dammit. I have to go to the hospital.	You know what else is pretty classic when the coffee guy asks for money, you say, "Sorry, my wallet's in my other pair of mocha-chinos." That always gets 'em.
What about you and the motorcycle accident guy!?	You can't pawn your personal stuff off on your patients!	I was trying to!	'Scuse us!Dude, please tell me you're not comparing getting cancer to knocking up your girlfriend.	Trust me, I know what you're going through. Just yesterday, I found out that my girlfriend
Anyhoo, there was some unexpected friendly fire. And, uh, even though I never got a chance to enter..."the village"...uh, there was a..."airstrike" on one of the outlying regions	He does.	No, I do. I find it gets the ladies going, but I occasionally get wrapped up in it myself, especially when I use some of my different voices....	Ooooh! She like-a the dirty talk!	Okay, on the night of said conception, uh, Kim and I nuded up, and um...the dirty talk began, and I got a little over-excited.
Anyway, I spoke to the gals up in OB-G, and they said it's not uncommon for a woman to get pregnant even if there was no actual penetration.	Thank you.

I find it gets the ladies going, but I occasionally get wrapped up in it myself, especially when I use some of my different voices....
No, I didn't have a condom.And, uh, we decided not to have sex because here's the kicker I didn't want to get her pregnant.	What you trying to tell us is that you...never actually had sex with her?

As I thought about how Mrs. Zeebee and I had gotten such a raw deal, I realized how easy it was for doctors to see themselves in their patients.Whether it's in the choices they made in their life...	Oh, no you didn't!	No, I didn't have a condom.And, uh, we decided not to have sex because here's the kicker I didn't want to get her pregnant.	What you trying to tell us is that you...never actually had sex with her?	Anyway, I spoke to the gals up in OB-G, and they said it's not uncommon for a woman to get pregnant even if there was no actual penetration.
Yeah.	You know what? I'm gonna get through this. Just you watch.	The most important thing to remember when you see yourself in a patient is that they're not actually you.In fact, sometimes, they're actually who we wish we had the courage to be.	Mrs. Zeebee, unfortunately the cancer isn't localized just to your breast. We're gonna have to start chemo right away.	Oh, man. This just sucks.
Whoa! Oof!	Right then, I knew exactly what I had to do, come hell or high water.	Yeah.	You know what? I'm gonna get through this. Just you watch.	The most important thing to remember when you see yourself in a patient is that they're not actually you.In fact, sometimes, they're actually who we wish we had the courage to be.
What the hell?	Uh-huh! I got your Juanita. Juanita, huh? Well you can Jua-nita this right there.	Whoa! Oof!	Right then, I knew exactly what I had to do, come hell or high water.	Yeah.
Are you gonna let me down anytime soon?	It's now or never.	What the hell?	Uh-huh! I got your Juanita. Juanita, huh? Well you can Jua-nita this right there.	Whoa! Oof!
As I acted like a flag, I sensed that the Janitor learned nothing from this experience.Dr. Cox, on the other hand, got halfway there. He may always be angry at work, but he had learned to control himself when it counts.	Not until you spend a little time acting like a flag.	Are you gonna let me down anytime soon?	It's now or never.	What the hell?
Of course I do! What about you? Any nieces or nephews?	So, uh, let's go.... Um.... Do you like kids?	You're right.	I dunno. If we keep it, it'll just end up in the dumpster.	Should we keep it or get rid of it?
Oh, no!	Yeah, I have a nephew. Although he's forty-five. But occasionally I do have to change his diaper he was kicked by a horse.	Of course I do! What about you? Any nieces or nephews?	So, uh, let's go.... Um.... Do you like kids?	You're right.
So beautiful! I hope you keep some ice in this locket, 'cause you're making me hot all over!	Yeah.	Oh, no!	Yeah, I have a nephew. Although he's forty-five. But occasionally I do have to change his diaper he was kicked by a horse.	Of course I do! What about you? Any nieces or nephews?
What? Oh! Sure! Uh, I'll take a look at it first thing tomorrow morning, huh?	Actually, it's the only picture I have of my biological father. D'you wanna see it?	So beautiful! I hope you keep some ice in this locket, 'cause you're making me hot all over!	Yeah.	Oh, no!
I'm totally fine with stalling.	Yep. All right, well, look, we don't need to make this decision tonight, right? I mean, plenty of time.	I know I will.	You think if it's a girl, you'd doink her?	Yeah, I'm not a big fan of adoption.
Big-time collegiate drum-line!	Check.	Stylish big daddy hat!	Check.	Okay, Brown Bear, commence Operation Brown Cub! Suitcase!
Lemme finish! What if the parents were like abusive drug addicts who would neglect their kids?	No abortions!	But what if	Okay, I'm gonna make this real simple: No abortions, okay?	But what if having this baby is a huge mistake for us?
Really?	Oh, well, in that case it'd be okay.	Lemme finish! What if the parents were like abusive drug addicts who would neglect their kids?	No abortions!	But what if
You know what might give us an inkling? We haven't technically had sex yet. That might help us find out if we're on the same page...you know...in the boudoir.	Yeah.You know what's making this so hard? This relationship is so new, we can't tell if we have a chance of making this work long-term.	Ohhh!	Owen Wilson.	Kirsten Dunst?
I'm sorry, I'm being an idiot, aren't I.	Are you hitting on me?	You know what might give us an inkling? We haven't technically had sex yet. That might help us find out if we're on the same page...you know...in the boudoir.	Yeah.You know what's making this so hard?

Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...!...Yeah!	Nope. Clothes off. We're doing it.	I'm sorry, I'm being an idiot, aren't I.	Are you hitting on me?	You know what might give us an inkling? We haven't technically had sex yet. That might help us find out if we're on the same page...you know...in the boudoir.
Tax deductions!	Which we already said.	I can finally buy Beanie Babies without feeling weird, and kids are great!	True.	your boobs'll get huge
Ohhh! Yeah! That's some	Ohhh! Nice one!	Tax deductions!	Which we already said.	I can finally buy Beanie Babies without feeling weird, and kids are great!
Nice. Let's see, that's twenty cons and nineteen pros. I guess we gotta abort.	All right, so then what's the final tally?	Ohhh! Yeah! That's some	Ohhh! Nice one!	Tax deductions!
Wait, I'm sorry. That's an eyelash, I made a wish. It's a tie abortion's off.	Yep.	Nice. Let's see, that's twenty cons and nineteen pros. I guess we gotta abort.	All right, so then what's the final tally?	Ohhh! Yeah! That's some
Every couple has its share of problems.	Okay, so now what?	Wait, I'm sorry. That's an eyelash, I made a wish. It's a tie abortion's off.	Yep.	Nice. Let's see, that's twenty cons and nineteen pros. I guess we gotta abort.
Ah, this is way over Justin's head. He's never been in love. Not real love, anyway.	You know, I'm a little preoccupied right now. Why don't you ask your unicorn?	Ahh! Should I have a baby, too?	Ah, it's really simple: See, when Carla says "I'm thirsty," Elliot'll say, "Oh no, I forgot the ice chips." That's when I walk in, ice in hand, and I say, "Christopher Turk, at your cervix!"	So what is Elliot's plan?
Eww. How about a second of that dynamite ape impression.I'm sorry, Cindy, once he's in monkey mode, you can't stop him. But who would want to, right? Cheers.Hey, Kim! Just checkin' to see if your socks are back on, since I knocked 'em off last night! Helloooooo!	Oh, I love this job I screw up, nobody gets hurt. Except Cindy.	Mmm.

Yeah, well, I'm very close to a tantrum.	Yeah, well, you know what? I can't be buying you stuff all the time!	You always buy me a cotton candy after the game to celebrate my good sportsmanship.	Yeah.	Ohh!
Come on, Vijay, first you dunk on me and yell, "Who's your bitch!" now you want free medical advice?	Could you guys look at my shoulder? I tweaked it pretty good.	Yeah, well, I'm very close to a tantrum.	Yeah, well, you know what? I can't be buying you stuff all the time!	You always buy me a cotton candy after the game to celebrate my good sportsmanship.
I'm sorry, my friend, but that's just not ethical.	I'll give you twenty bucks.	Come on, Vijay, first you dunk on me and yell, "Who's your bitch!" now you want free medical advice?	Could you guys look at my shoulder? I tweaked it pretty good.	Yeah, well, I'm very close to a tantrum.
You heartless bastard. All right, let's see your disgusting rash.	Oh, you don't want my back-alley money, do you?	Ohhhhh! You crafty, crafty man that is fluffing up nicely. Hey, give me some money, I'm jonesing for some c-squared.	Just added the dye.	I'm sorry, cotton candy man, but unlike my friend, here, I have no interest in being sued for Do I smell blue?
Well that sucks, 'cause I was counting on you to make it look easy so I know I can handle it when my turn comes.	I look at Isabella, and I get really scared. And I'm gonna need you to be there to help me through this.	Please, this isn't about that. It's just that I looked all over, I never found any balloons. You'd think there'd be some balloons.	J.D., for the last time, nothing happened.	I know. In seven months, I'm gonna have a family, too.
Turk, you're at the beginning of your career. You know you're gonna make plenty of money.	Awesome.	Well that sucks, 'cause I was counting on you to make it look easy so I know I can handle it when my turn comes.	I look at Isabella, and I get really scared.

You're gonna be just fine.	It's good to hear that from you, thank you.	Turk, you're at the beginning of your career. You know you're gonna make plenty of money.	Awesome.	Well that sucks, 'cause I was counting on you to make it look easy so I know I can handle it when my turn comes.
...Totally fine.	I suppose so.	You're gonna be just fine.	It's good to hear that from you, thank you.	Turk, you're at the beginning of your career. You know you're gonna make plenty of money.
Would you mind telling me that I'm gonna be fine, Turk? Am I gonna be fine? I think I'm gonna be fine!	Yeah.	...Totally fine.	I suppose so.	You're gonna be just fine.
I really like her.	Well, I would, but I don't know how much you like Kim.	Would you mind telling me that I'm gonna be fine, Turk? Am I gonna be fine? I think I'm gonna be fine!	Yeah.	...Totally fine.
Thanks.	Then you're gonna be fine.	I really like her.	Well, I would, but I don't know how much you like Kim.	Would you mind telling me that I'm gonna be fine, Turk? Am I gonna be fine? I think I'm gonna be fine!
As for me, I was just excited to have the opportunity to get to know the mother of my child better.	I'd...like to join your practice.	...or taking a new job.	Hey.Now clean up this mess.	Opportunities are everywhere......Whether it's accepting an old job...
Cool! Is it over at County? 'Cause that way I can drop you off every morning.	I got offered a new job.	As for me, I was just excited to have the opportunity to get to know the mother of my child better.	I'd...like to join your practice.	...or taking a new job.

Why stop at hardwood?	Yeah, you actually told me that on the day that he died. Anywho, I was thinking maybe we should put in some new hardwood floors.	"7- car pile-up" would be a good name for a rock band.	Hey, roomie! I went shopping. Oh, this couch reminded me of my grandpa. He used to drive around in a car just like it. You know, until he was killed in that 7-car pile-up.	To me, the best thing about Elliot is all her extra cash.
Careful. Trampoline floors take some gettin' used to. But I love 'em.I like bouncing, but it is dangerous.	Yay, the new floors are in!	Why stop at hardwood?	Yeah, you actually told me that on the day that he died. Anywho, I was thinking maybe we should put in some new hardwood floors.	"7- car pile-up" would be a good name for a rock band.
Are you kidding me? I can't just up and leave, I got to find an apartment I live in a T.P.	Oh, there's nothing like that first ultrasound. Bring tissue.	Oh man, Kim is having her first ultrasound tommorow.	I'm trying, Doc, but it's hard.	Alright, Mr. Mariani, mazel tov; you are the proud owner of yet another kidney stone! Did you try laying off the red meat, buddy?
Alright.	Oh yeah, just like that.	You got it, pal.	Could you rub that spot off my dashboard?	Of course, Jonathan 3000.
It can get lonely on the road, even for computers. But this is gonna be great, right?	That's the stuff, you bitch!	Alright.	Oh yeah, just like that.	You got it, pal.
There are a lot of times in life when you just got to take control.	Can I say something? I don't know this young man, I wish I did. I admire his spirit! And if he says we must continue on then I say I am in!	You guys, Turk told me how amazing it was when he say Izzy's ultrasound, I can't miss this, I just, I won't.	Ahhh! Oh... I think you popped it back in the joint.	See? He's great. And so is Ted.
No... no, c'mon. Come back from this in a couple of months and we'll pick up whereever we left off. I mean, I guess it will be a little more casual, we should probably won't talk without either one of us wearing full body condoms.	Unless it was a girl, then you could just throw like yourself. Can I ask you something? Were we just staying together cuz' we were having a kid?	I was alredy kinda looking for doing all those parents things you hear about, you know like - change diapers, first steps, playing catch. Turk was gonna even teach me how to throw like a guy, so...	I know...	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I just... it's kinda weird, there was this thing that I never met and now it's gone and I kinda miss it.
Did they?	What if I... wasn't coming back because they offered me a permanent position here?	No... no, c'mon. Come back from this in a couple of months and we'll pick up whereever we left off.

We sat there all night and talked about everything. How we felt about each other, whether we can handle a long distance relationship, did she ever see herself come back to 'The Sacred Heart', will a pizza place deliver to a bench at three in the morning... they would... And on the end of it all, we realized that without a baby in the picture, the best thing to do is to say goodbye, stay friends and just hope that our paths cross again. Someday.	Yeah...	Did they?	What if I... wasn't coming back because they offered me a permanent position here?	No... no, c'mon. Come back from this in a couple of months and we'll pick up whereever we left off.

Then you have to get the floor nurses to play along.	Deal.	Then you have to convince the morgue guy to sit on the paperwork so the deceased's bed stays open.	Cool, Mr. Rabinowitz just kicked it! Oh, don't worry, he put his peep in an electrical socket. You can't do that.	When a patient doesn't have insurance, you have to work around the system. First, you have to find someone who's recently died.
Then you have to find a surgeon to do the work pro bono.	Enjoy your kosher meal, Mr. Rabinowitz.	Then you have to get the floor nurses to play along.	Deal.	Then you have to convince the morgue guy to sit on the paperwork so the deceased's bed stays open.
Uh, we want to go somewhere with you.	What is it?	Dr. Kelso, we need to talk to you.	Bob, I want to thank you for doing all this, even though I don't have any...	But, most importantly, you can't let any higher-ups find out that a patient is uninsured, even if they're the ones who brought her here in the first place.
A spa. We'd like to get some massages.	Okay. Where?	Uh, we want to go somewhere with you.	What is it?	Dr. Kelso, we need to talk to you.
Why?	Bring him back!	Please, God!	Lord!	God, please!
Even though I was the only one who knew how to embrace life, we all left thinking about how important trust is.Dr. Cox let Elliot keep her trust in humankind a while longer.	I'm telling you guys, this could have been a much bigger moment.	And just like that, we got our old scrubs back.	Yeah, when you took away the scrubs, you took away the trust, and without trust, everything falls apart.	We used to, but if you're gonna threaten to fire us over taking a pair of scrubs, why wouldn't we think you'd fire us for treating an uninsured patient?
