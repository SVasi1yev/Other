1	J.D.'s narration	Since I was a kid, I've been able to sleep through anything - storms, sirens, you name it. Last night, I didn't sleep.I guess I get a little goofy when I'm nervous.You see, today isn't just any other day. It's my first day.
2	J.D.	I'm the man.
3	J.D.'s narration	And four years of pre-med, four years of med school, and tons of unpaid loans have made me realize one thing...
4	Nurse Kearney	Good. Could you go drop an NG tube on the patient in 234, and call the attending that the lavage is positive?
5	J.D.'s narration	I don't know jack.
6	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
7	J.D.'s narration	So, this is my story.
8	J.D.	Uh, I'm supposed to be up in intensive care.
9	Nurse Kearney	Good. We just turfed him there.
10	J.D.'s narration	Look, I became a doctor because I wanted to help people. But orientation yesterday... it didn't really focus on patient care.
11	Lawyer	The hospital doesn't want to be sued. Being sued is not a good thing.
12	J.D.	Hey, Turk.
13	Turk	'Sup.
14	J.D.	You know how I'm totally down with the rap music?
15	Turk	Dude, be whiter.
16	J.D.'s narration	Chris Turk's my best friend. We roomed together in college...We roomed together in med school...Hell, we even got accepted by the same hospital.
17	J.D.	Here's the thing: TuPac, DMX, Dr. Dre, in most of their songs, these artists use an extremely volatile racial slur... the "N" word.
18	Turk	I got it.
19	J.D.	Right. My question is this: if we're both singing along, and knowing that otherwise I would never use the word, am I allowed to say-
20	Turk	No.
21	J.D.	See, that's good for me to know. I didn't-I didn't know that.
22	Lawyer	Finally, doctors, if there is a mistake, don't admit it to the patient. Of course, if the patient is deceased, and you're sure, you can feel free to tell him or her... anything.
23	J.D.	Hey, listen, I found us an apartment....
24	Dr. Kelso	Okay, gang. I'm Dr. Bob Kelso, and I'm your Chief of Medicine. So, I just want to encourage you all to think of me as your safety net. Because, I promise you, we're family here.Now, then, go get 'em, doctors.
25	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26	Turk	So, the surgical interns are gonna go grab a beer.
27	J.D.	The medical interns are having a PacMan tournament....Apparently we're all twelve.
28	Elliot	I love PacMan.
29	J.D.	Me too. I love watching it, I love playing it, I love all of it.
30	Elliot	I'm Elliot.
31	Turk	Eeellliiiiooott...
32	Elliot	Yeah. Don't do that.
33	J.D.	I'm J.D., this is Turk.
34	Turk	Elliot, are you medical, or surgical?
35	Elliot	Medical.
36	J.D.'s narration	Heh-heh. Hello.
37	Elliot	So, every male in my family is a doctor: my dad, my grand-dad, and my brother. I guess that's why dad gave me a guy's name, made me play sports, date girls. I'm joking.
38	J.D.	I know. I would have laughed if you'd paused.
39	Elliot	Anyway, I know what you're thinking.
40	J.D.'s narration	Your butt looks like two Pringles hugging.
41	J.D.	No you don't.
42	Elliot	I'm probably "Miss Hyper Competitive". I mean, it used to be a big problem for me. "Used to" - past tense.
43	J.D.	Hey, are we, like, racing?
44	Elliot	Yes!
45	J.D.'s narration	Please. I'm not that desperate.
46	Elliot	So, you do a lot of cardio, or...?
47	J.D.	Oh, yeah.
48	Dr. Steadman	Elliot Reid? John Dorian? Great. One: I am your resident, Dr. Jeffrey Steadman - not "Jeff". Two: Here are your manuals. This -
49	J.D.'s narration	You ever notice how quickly some people make an impression?
50	Dr. Steadman	I'm a tool. I'm a tool. I'm a tool, tool, tool, an unbelievably annoying tool.
51	J.D.	Yeah.
52	Dr. Steadman	Yeah. Finally, these are your beepers . From now on, they control your entire life. 'Kay? Thanks. Move it.
53	J.D.'s narration	Back to today.
54	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
55	J.D.	Uh, I was paged.
56	Carla	Aww, first day, Bambi? Carla will take care of you. Don't look at me when we're moving someone.
57	J.D.	Why?
58	Carla	We're waiting for Dr. Cox.
59	J.D.	Hi, doctor, I'm-
60	Dr. Cox	Place an IV for me.
61	J.D.	We'll talk later.
62	Dr. Cox	Carla, can I ask you a personal question? Do you spray the perfume on or just fill your bathtub up and splash around in it?
63	Carla	I smell nice.
64	J.D.'s narration	Come on, you've done this to cadavers before. So this guy's alive, just poke it through his skin! Poke it through! Now!
65	Dr. Cox	Time's up. Carla, would you do it for him, please? I also need an A.B.G.
66	J.D.	Why are you telling her?
67	Dr. Cox	Shut up and watch.
68	Carla	Be nice to Bambi!
69	Dr. Cox	Why does this GOMER got to try and die everyday during my lunch?
70	J.D.	That's a little insensitive.
71	J.D.'s narration	Mistake.
72	Dr. Cox	Man's 92 years old, he has full dementia, he doesn't even know we're here, he's inches from Carla's rack and he hasn't even flinched.
73	Carla	Aww, that is so sweet.
74	Dr. Cox	Yeah, it is.
75	J.D.	What about his subconscious?
76	Dr. Cox	Eisenhower was a sissy.I think by the grace of God we're gonna be okay. Oh, and from now on, whenever I'm in the room, you're definitely not allowed to talk.
77	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
78	Dr. Kelso	Now...Dr. Dorian, can you tell me what ailment most often....
79	J.D.'s Narration	I think I'm gonna love rounds. It's like being on a gameshow.
80	J.D.	What is euremia?
81	Dr. Kelso	That's my boy!Hey, nice, clean job on the foley catheter.
82	J.D.'s Narration	I'd had a nurse do it. Unfortunately, I'm still afraid to touch anybody.I've been thinking a lot about Elliot....A whole lot.
83	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Reid, you're late.
84	Elliot	I got puked on.
85	Dr. Kelso	You're off the hook if you can tell me what to look for in a euremic patient.
86	J.D.'s Thoughts	Anyway...I'm going for it.
87	J.D.	Infection.
88	Elliot	Infection?
89	Dr. Kelso	That's my girl!Moving on.
90	Elliot	I knew the answer!
91	J.D.	I'm sure you did.
92	Elliot	I was just frazzled.
93	J.D.	Well, how could you not be....
94	Elliot	You know with the...
95	J.D.	Oh, I know. Yeah.
96	Elliot	Good. But thanks. If there's anything I can ever do for you, just
97	J.D.	You could let me take you to dinner tomorrow night.Around seven.... Or eight.
98	Elliot	Why not.
99	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
100	J.D.'s Thoughts	"Why not." That's what she said. "Why not"!
101	Boy	Daddy, why did you marry mommy?
102	J.D.	Well, Tiger, I gave her an answer during rounds, and she screwed my brains out.
103	Boy	You the man!
104	Dr. Cox	What the hell are you doing?Did you actually just page me to find out how much Tylenol to give to Mrs. Lendsner?
105	J.D.	I was worried that it could exacerbate the patient's
106	Dr. Cox	It's regular-strength Tylenol! Here's what'cha do: Get her to open her mouth, take a handful, and throw it at her. Whatever sticks, that's the correct dosage.
107	J.D.	But I
108	Dr. Cox	And under no circumstances are you to compromise our "no talking" agreement.
109	J.D.	Dr. Kelso, he's always telling me, you know, "You've gotta stay positive!"
110	Dr. Cox	I'm gonna go ahead and say this just as carefully as possible so I don't overstate it: Dr. Kelso is the most evil human being on the planet. And may, in fact, be Satan, himself.
111	J.D.	It's just that, this isn't really what I expected... You know...Most of my patients are, uh...older and sorta checked-out, mentally.
112	Dr. Cox	Pumpkin, that's modern medicine. Advances that keep people alive who should have died a long time ago, back when they lost what made them people.Now, your job is to stay sane enough so that when someone does come in that you actually can help, you're not so brain-dead that you can't function. For the love of God, what!?
113	J.D.	It's just that, do you really think we should be talking about this in front of....
114	Dr. Cox	Her? She's dead.Write this down, newbie: If you push around a stiff, nobody'll ask you to do anything.
115	J.D.	You've been like a father to me.
116	Dr. Cox	Fair enough, you want some real advice? If they find out the nurses are doing your procedures for you, your ass'll be kicked outta here so quick, it'll make your head spin.
117	J.D.'s Thoughts	And there it is.
118	Dr. Cox	Have a terrific day.
119	Elderly Lady	I'm not really dead.
120	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
121	Carla	Okay, Bambi, here's Mrs. Lendsner's tox-screen.
122	J.D.'s Thoughts	I wonder if Turk's having the same experience I am.
123	Turk	I am such a stud!
124	J.D.'s Thoughts	Probably not
125	Turk	This morning, I had my hands inside of a guy's chest. I couldn't even see them! I should not be allowed to do stuff like that. Whazzup.
126	J.D.	And you weren't scared?
127	Turk	One way or another, everyone stops bleeding. That is so deep.
128	Carla	No it isn't.
129	Turk	It's a little deep.
130	J.D.	Hey, we never got to talk about the apartment, I wanted to
131	Todd	T-man!
132	Turk	Word up, boy; how ya doin', man.
133	Todd	All right.
134	Turk	All right, Todd, J.D.; J.D., this is my man, Todd.
135	J.D.	Oww!
136	J.D.'s Narration	And like that, I was back in high school. You see, surgical interns, they're all slice-'em-and-dice-'em. They're the jocks. Medical interns, we're trained to think about the body; diagnose, test. Medical interns, well....
137	Todd	Hey, you got a stain.
138	J.D.'s Narration	....We're the chess club.
139	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
140	Mr. Bursky	I just have bad gas. What are you testing me for?
141	J.D.	We need to know if your gas could be harmful to others.
142	J.D.'s Thoughts	He's just scared. Talk to him.
143	J.D.	Look, Mr. Bursky, I heard a systolic murmur in your heart, which is most likely nothing. But if you don't let me check you out, I'm gonna worry about you all day.
144	Mr. Bursky	Then I'll do it. For you.
145	J.D.	You're a good man.
146	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
147	Cut to	hospital interior, where J.D. is patiently standing behind the janitor, who is on a ladder, working on an elevator door.
148	J.D.	I'm I'm waiting for someone.
149	Janitor	The door is broke. Maybe the fifth time or so. It don't open.
150	J.D.	Maybe there's a penny stuck in there?
151	Janitor	Why a penny?
152	J.D.	I dunno.
153	Janitor	Did you stick a penny in there?
154	J.D.	No. I was I was just making small talk.
155	Janitor	If I find a penny in there, I'm taking you down.

157	Dr. Kelso	Welcome to rounds, kids. Let's
158	J.D.'s Narration	Elliot is the only thing keeping me from losing my mind. She's my dream girl.
159	Dr. Kelso	...The necrosis and infected stool most likely indicate what, Dr...... Dorian?
160	Elliot	I don't know!
161	J.D.	Sir, I have no idea.
162	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Reid, can you help him out?
163	Elliot	I'd say it's superior mesenteric insufficiency.
164	Dr. Kelso	That's my girl! Patient number two!
165	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
166	J.D.'s Thoughts	Draining Mrs. Pratt's stomach fluid'll get my spirits back up.
167	J.D.	Circles for you.
168	Mrs. Pratt	Shut up and do it.
169	J.D.'s Thoughts	Fantastic.Just suck out the fluid with the giant needle.
170	J.D.	I think this needle's too big. I'm gonna get a nurse.
171	Turk	Come on, man, learn by doing! Learn by doing.
172	J.D.'s Narration	Why couldn't I do that? I hated him at that moment.
173	Turk	Okay, uh, maybe the needle was just a little too big.
174	J.D.	Oh, you think?
175	Mrs. Pratt	What's going on down there?
176	Turk	Nothing, ma'am, this is totally normal.
177	J.D.	So, are you gonna are you gonna move your stuff in or what?
178	Turk	That's why I came by. I think it's better if we both branched out a little. What do you think?
179	J.D.'s Thoughts	Tell him you think that's stupid. Tell him you need him.
180	J.D.	Yeah, I... I feel the same way.
181	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
182	Mr. Bursky	So, what's it like being a young, hot-shot doctor?
183	J.D.	It's like... Did you ever go see a movie that everyone told you was great, and then because of all those expectations, you ended up totally disappointed?
184	Mr. Bursky	Movies nowadays have too many special effects.
185	J.D.	Yeah, that was pretty much my point.
186	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
187	J.D.'s Narration	My first code. See, here's how it works: Someone's heart fails, they beep everyone. The first doctor in has to run the room, tell everyone what to do.... Basically decide if the patient lives or dies. What am I, crazy?
188	J.D.	Agh! You chicken!
189	J.D.'s Narration	Don't worry about the patient, Turk was already there.... 'Learning by doing.'
190	Todd	Charge!
191	Turk	Clear!
192	J.D.'s Narration	Plus, it turns out, the guy was just sleeping; attached to a faulty monitor.
193	J.D.	I thought we cared about each other....
194	Elliot	Oh please, if you didn't want to sleep with me, you'd have done the same thing.
195	J.D.	Well, I'll tell you one thing, the last thing in the world I wanna do is sleep wit'cha now!
196	Elliot	Do me right here.
197	J.D.	Okay.
198	Elliot	See!
199	J.D.	ARGH!
200	Dr. Cox	Right. Pass me a trach. kit.Thanks.
201	J.D.	Our date is is totally canceled!
202	Elliot	Pff!
203	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
204	J.D.'s Narration	I was sitting on the floor for two reasons. One, I tried to lock Elliot in that supply closet, and she kicked me hard. And two, the on call-room was locked.
205	J.D.	Come on! I got, like, ten minutes to sleep!
206	Turk	Wait. Tell me if I'm going too fast, okay?
207	Carla	Lose the clothes.
208	J.D.'s Thoughts	I heard that Turk was gonna move in with Todd. I'm surprised that high-fiving freak isn't in there with him.
209	Todd	Damn, this is hot.
210	Carla	Nice.
211	Turk	Your turn.
212	Carla	No, I gotta get back. But, very nice.Oh, hey, Bambi!
213	Turk	So, uhh, I'll call you, okay?
214	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
215	Dr. Cox	Give me a big "ah".
216	Billy	Ah.
217	Dr. Cox	A big boy "ah".
218	Billy	Ahhh!
219	J.D.	Turk practically had sex in the on-call room.
220	Dr. Cox	You realize, of course, I have no idea who Turk is....But, good for him. You see, Billy, it turns out that sex is life-affirming.Now, whatta ya say, champ; you got a urine sample in there for me?
221	Billy	But I just did, five minutes ago.
222	Dr. Cox	I know you did, but here's the thing: I'd like you to take this cup, put it on the ground, close your eyes, and just go nuts! Whatta ya say!
223	Billy	Cool!
224	Dr. Cox	Atta boy! Go get 'em, champ!Why are you here?
225	J.D.	Seems like a good kid.
226	Dr. Cox	You're worried about being on-call tonight, aren't you.
227	J.D.'s Thoughts	Yeah.
228	Dr. Cox	Look, worst case scenario, you kill somebody, and that hangs over your head the rest of your life....But that is the absolute worst case scenario. Come on, newbie, look: Just have the nurses do all the stuff you're still too chicken to do, which I assume covers just about everything, and if you have a really rough admission
229	J.D.	Call you?
230	Dr. Cox	No! I was gonna say go hide in the closet again!
231	Billy	Yee-ha! This is fun!

233	A Staff Member	Hey, nurse?
234	Elliot	I'm a doctor, okay? The stethoscope, the beeper a doctor, got it?
235	Carla	Relax.
236	Elliot	I just hate it. I hate the "darlin's" I hate the "sweethearts"...
237	Carla	You don't need to tell me how hard it is being a woman around here.
238	Elliot	Well, you're certainly furthering the cause by wearing a thong to work and hooking up in the on-call room.Word gets around.
239	Carla	You talk like that, do you even know my name?I spend every second of my life either here, or taking care of my mom. So, yeah, maybe I needed a little closeness. I'm sure you never had a quickie at the club, right? Or snuck some skinny, flat-butted college boy up to your sorority room. And my thong? I happen to think it makes my ass look good. And some days, I need to feel good about something around here. And you judge me? Well, guess what, word does get around, Miss "Out For Herself", so you can dump on everyone here if you want; but you will not hurt me.
240	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
241	J.D.	Her name's Carla, by the way....

245	Cut to	Interior The Doctors' Lounge.
246	Dr. Kelso	Hey, Champ! First night on call starts soon, huh? Gosh, you must be excited.
247	J.D.'s Thoughts	Agghh!
248	J.D.	You bet'cha.
249	Dr. Kelso	Oh! About Mrs. Pratt.... I heard you wanted to put her on the hospital's transplant list. I just thought I'd recommend keeping her on dialysis a little while longer, maybe we'll get lucky!
250	J.D.	No problem, sir.
251	Dr. Kelso	Great! Have a ball...on call! A little poem for you.
252	Carla	Bambi, come on. Let's go.
253	J.D.	I'll check on you every ten minutes, Mrs. Moreno, okay?
254	Nurse Roberts	I need to see you in Mr. Bursky's room.
255	J.D.	Are you flirting with me?You are, aren't you!
256	Nurse Roberts	He crashed. The attending thinks it was a pulmonary embolism.No way anyone could have caught it. Anyhow, you have to pronounce him.
257	J.D.	Why didn't anybody page me?
258	Nurse Roberts	Could you just pronounce him so I can go home?
259	J.D.'s Narration	I'll never forget that moment, the way he looked exactly the same...only completely different. The shame that all I could think about was how hard this was for me.
260	J.D.	Time of death 0200.
261	J.D.'s Narration	I just wanted to help people.
262	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
263	J.D.'s Narration	The hardest part is how quickly you have to move on.
264	J.D.	Don't worry, man. You're gonna be fine.
265	Turk	Hey. I lied before, man. I'm scared every second.
266	J.D.	Really?
267	Turk	It's a good thing they make surgical masks, 'cause if they didn't, everyone would know that my face is like this the whole time...
268	J.D.	Well, I think it's okay to be scared.
269	Turk	Well, I need you to tell me that every once in a while, man.
270	J.D.'s Thoughts	He needs me?
271	Turk	Anyway, I just came to check up on you; see how you're doing.
272	J.D.'s Thoughts	Ask him to move in again.
273	J.D.	You know, Turk, the offer still stands if you wanna....
274	Turk	Dude, I already took the keys out' your bag.I love you.
275	Cut to	A Hospital Hallway.
276	J.D.'s Narration	And like that, I got a second wind.
277	Janitor	I'm watching you....
278	Dr. Kelso	How're you holding up?
279	J.D.'s Thoughts	Ah, there he is, my safety net.
280	Dr. Kelso	I saw that you're still pushing to put Mrs. Pratt on the transplant list. Bad news, though, sport: she doesn't have the insurance to cover it.
281	J.D.	Yeah, but she's, like, a second away from total renal failure.
282	Dr. Kelso	Okay..... Uh, did you ask the Bursky family for permission to do an autopsy?
283	J.D.	They're still in there with him, sir.
284	Dr. Kelso	It's a teaching hospital, son, you gotta ask.
285	J.D. Thoughts	Just tell him you can't see Mr. Bursky again. He'll understand.
286	J.D.	Sir, do you do you think I could skip just this one?
287	Dr. Kelso	Why, sure, sport.
288	J.D.'s Narration	See? Every story needs a good guy.
289	Dr. Kelso	In fact, why don't you just head on home. You look kinda tired.
290	J.D.	I am pretty tired!
291	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Dorian, do you not realize that you're nothing but a large pair of scrubs to me? For God's sake, the only reason I carry this chart around is so I can pretend to remember your damn names! Now look, if the patient has insurance, you treat them; if they don't, you show them the door.And if somebody dies, you get the autopsy. You get it by rounds tomorrow morning, or I'll be scratching your name off my chart! Are we clear!?Answer me!!!
292	J.D.	Crystal clear.
293	Dr. Kelso	Great, sport.
294	J.D.'s Narration	I don't get it, if he's the jerk, then who's the good guy?
295	Carla	Car accident, crashed in the elevator on the way up.
296	Dr. Cox	We gotta relieve the pressure in his chest. J.D., do it.
297	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh God, no.
298	Dr. Cox	Look at me. You can do this.
299	J.D.'s Narration	And I believed him...
300	J.D.	Chest-tube tray.
301	J.D.'s Narration	...You know, kinda.
302	Dr. Cox	Come on, baby, let's go; chop-chop.
303	J.D.'s Thoughts	You can do this. You have to do this.
304	Dr. Cox	J.D., cut him or lose him.
305	J.D.	Okay, gimme the tube.I can't get it through the pleura.
306	Dr. Cox	Well, don't be gentle, get it in there.
307	J.D.	Okay, connect it, please, Carla.
308	Carla	Normal rhythm.
309	J.D.	No way!
310	Dr. Cox	Eh? It's a piece of cake.That's your patient.
311	J.D.	You're leaving?
312	Dr. Cox	That's your patient, doctor.
313	Carla	G'head.That's enough.
314	J.D.	Sorry. It's a very big moment for me.
315	Carla	Mm-hmm.
316	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
317	J.D.'s Narration	So, I guess that's it for now. Thirty-one hours, twelve minutes, and I am....
318	Elliot	You're finally off?
319	J.D.	Almost. I have one more really annoying thing I gotta do.
320	Elliot	If you're talking about getting the Bursky autopsy, I already called the family for you. And they said fine, and to thank you, and I'm sorry. ...They didn't say that last part, I did.
321	J.D.'s Narration	The worst part was knowing, right then, that I could never forgive her.
322	J.D.'s Thoughts	I forgive her.
323	J.D.'s Narration	You see, I can't survive on my own.
324	Dr. Steadman	I'm a dork. I'm a dork! I'm a dork. ...I'm a dork.
325	J.D.'s Narration	Even now, when I finally get to go home, in the back of my head, I'll know the hospital's still here, wide awake.
326	Carla	Bambi! Get out while you still can.
327	J.D.'s Narration	But what the hell. The most important thing is that I got through my first three days without looking like a complete idiot.
328	J.D.	I'm the man.
329	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
330	J.D.'s Narration	The human brain is remarkable. Once a day for nine years, I thought I lost my watch 'cause I can't remember which wrist it's on.And yet, just after two weeks, all the little things that scared me at first are like second nature. Catheters, chest tubes, IVs......Everything has started to click.
331	Dr. Kelso	Are you? Because if you have time to listen to music, then I assume you have time to finish your paperwork!
332	Janitor	"...Having a good time...."Keep movin'.
333	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
334	J.D.'s Narration	That workday started like every other.
335	Cut to	Hospital, interior - Admissions Area.
336	J.D.	How's it going?
337	Janitor	I'm 37 years old, and I'm a janitor; how do you think it's going?
338	J.D.	Now, there is nothing wrong with being a janitor.
339	Janitor	Really? Thank you. You...you've turned my life around. I'm gonna have to go tell my janitor wife and all our janitor kids that life is worth living; and that comes straight from our hero, Dr. Whoozitz.... Dr. Nothin'.No, seriously, come on. You can come over to my humble house and point out things that are cheap.
340	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
341	J.D.'s Narration	Luckily, I had that night off to regroup.
342	Cut to	Interior - the living room.
343	Elliot	Your dog is creepy.
344	J.D.	Aww... be nice to Rowdy. The guy we bought him from used to keep him in a box full of old hats.
345	Elliot	Ew.
346	Turk	Okay, dude, why is she here all the time?
347	J.D.	Just give her a chance, man.
348	Turk	Ohh... you want to hit that!
349	J.D.	Nooo....
350	Turk	Yeah!
351	J.D.	No. She's just a friend, man.
352	Turk	Yeah.
353	J.D.	I think it's healthy hanging out with a girl without the ultimate goal being sex. You know?
354	Turk	I'm not following you.
355	Elliot	Creepy.... I had a run-in with that Nurse Carla yesterday. She forgot to check out the stats on a patient, and then she gave me attitude about it.
356	J.D.	What'd you tell on her, or something?
357	Dr. Kelso	Who's responsible for this?
358	Elliot	She is.I don't remember... And why would you automatically assume it was my fault?
359	J.D.'s Thoughts	It would be a good point, except that Elliot puts her foot in her mouth. A lot. She can't really seem to stop.
360	Elliot	Just because I occasionally say something stupid doesn't mean I'm in the hospital going door to door annoying people, like some crazed Jehovah's Witness.Oh. You're not?
361	Turk	No.But my mother is.
362	J.D.	He's black, too. You should tease him about that.
363	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
364	J.D.'s Narration	Me, I'm doing better with new people. Like Carla, for instance.
365	Carla	Hey, Bambi; that blond stick you hang out with? Tell her...Que se cuide la nalguita esa, porque si no le voy a tumbar todo el tinte rubio de la cabeza.
366	J.D.	You might have to write that down for me.
367	J.D.'s Narration	And Dr. Cox, we've really connected.I'm kinda like his protege.
368	Dr. Cox	I need to see his chart
369	J.D.	Done. Copied. And Highlighted.
370	Dr. Cox	Unfortunately, Radar, I'm fresh out of gold stars. Multilobar pneumonia at 31...? How much does this guy smoke?
371	J.D.	I dunno.
372	Dr. Cox	You realize, of course, it's your attention to detail that impresses me most. How many packs a day, genius.
373	Will	Half a pack.
374	Dr. Cox	Oh, I'm sorry, I phrased the question wrong. How many packs a day... really.
375	Will	Eleven.Now you don't know where I'm coming from!Two or three packs.
376	Dr. Cox	Well, let's hear it...
377	J.D.	Oh, I don't smoke, so... zero packs.
378	Carla	What tests have you ordered?
379	J.D.	Oh. I know, I was just totally kidding with you.
380	Will	He was... We're all in on it.
381	J.D.'s Thoughts	I like Will. That actually makes this harder.
382	J.D.	I ordered blood cultures, and a high-resolution CT.
383	Will	What are you looking for?
384	Dr. Cox	Cancer.
385	J.D.'s Thoughts	When you say the word "cancer", every person reacts the same way.
386	Will	Excellent.
387	J.D.'s Thoughts	Not like that.There it is.
388	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
389	J.D.'s Narration	I never really know what to say to Turk's stupid surgery buddies. But I'm getting better.
390	J.D.	So....How's surgery?
391	Todd	It rocks... But my bedroom, that's where I really operate! Am I right? Come on, show Todd some love!
392	J.D.'s Thoughts	I hate showing Todd love.
393	Carla	Hey, Bambi. Why are you over here slumming with these scalpel jocks?
394	Turk	Please baby, this, here, is the V.I.P table.Why don't you sit your fine self down?
395	J.D.	"Baby, this, here, is the V.I.P table..."
396	Turk	I'm not really interested in her.
397	Todd	Yeah? Then maybe the Todd'll show that little biscuit some love!
398	J.D.'s Thoughts	Maybe he's a little interested.
399	Todd	Fine. Todd'll show himself some love.
400	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
401	Turk	I'm thinking about asking Carla out today. What do you think?
402	J.D.	I think the janitor's out to get me.
403	Turk	Wow. Thank you so much for your help. You know what? Why don't you be just a little bit more paranoid.
404	J.D.	Wait, Turk.
405	Janitor	That's him.
406	Cut to	Nurses' Station.
407	Elliot	Hi, how are you? Um... I need, uh, David Farr's chart?
408	Nurse Roberts	We all need lots of things.
409	Elliot	Great.Uh, Dr. Kelso! You're the Chief of Medicine, is there a 'special' way to communicate with the nursing staff that I'm not getting?
410	Dr. Kelso	Well, uh, sugar won't work because they're already so sweet.Now, listen Dr...Whatever-the-hell-your-name-is, you tattled yesterday, I responded I feel closer to you than ever, really but the ramifications are yours. So don't try to drag me into your pathetic, whiny, little squabble with that God-awful bunch of malcontents. I hope you all kill each other! Have a great day, ladies.
411	Elliot	I hate this place.
412	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
413	J.D.	Dr. Cox; I got, uh, Will's CT results back. No cancer! So, uh, what should I tell him?
414	Dr. Cox	I'd open with that.
415	J.D.	Right, it's just, you know, he's headed down such a bad road, I thought you and I could talk to him....
416	J.D.'s Narration	When you really lock in with a mentor, you start to understand the meaning behind their words.
417	Dr. Cox	You do whatever you want.
418	J.D.'s Narration	Means, "Great idea!"
419	Dr. Cox	I'm, um, I'm just happy you haven't messed up yet today.
420	J.D.'s Narration	Means, "You're really coming along as a doctor."
421	Dr. Cox	Don't. Ever. Touch me.
422	J.D.'s Narration	Means, Don't ever touch him.
423	J.D.	Just thought it was a nice moment.
424	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
425	Elliot	No, I don't wanna.
426	J.D.	No, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon.
427	Elliot	Carla...I...shouldn't have told Dr. Kelso on you.
428	Carla	No, you shouldn't have.
429	J.D.'s Thoughts	Ahhh, the comfortable silences.
430	Carla	But thank you for apologizing.
431	J.D.	Okay, good!
432	Elliot	I I just want to make one thing clear.
433	J.D.	No, see, nothing needs to be clear.
434	Elliot	I still think you were in the wrong. Checking for the statics is your job, and I need to know that you're going to take care of it.
435	Cut to	a shot of Elliot's perspective from inside the grave. Carla, dressed in black, coldly flicks the ashes from a cigarette into the grave.
436	Elliot	That's all I'm saying.There. All better!
437	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
438	J.D.	So... yes! As of now, you have no signs of cancer.
439	Will	Woo! Who rules? Will rules!
440	J.D.	Uh, Will, it's important you realize this isn't great news.
441	Will	Are you sure? 'Cause, that's how it first hit me.
442	J.D.	Yeah, well, Will, you're on a slippery slope, man.
443	J.D.'s Narration	I had to scare him, but I had the sense he'd heard it all before. Luckily, part of being a doctor is your ability to improvise.
444	J.D.	So, right now, the one thing that I want you to think about......How would you like to sound like this?
445	Will	Let me see.This is so cool!
446	J.D.	No, it's not.
447	Will	Bwiddy-bwiddy-bwiddy. Okay, doc.
448	J.D.	It's not a toy.Would you like to play a game?
449	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes, if all you have is old words, all you can do is put them together and hope they say something new.
450	J.D.	Look, man, you're a great patient. I like you enough to hope I never see you again. But, I promise you, if you keep smoking, you'll be back here. I bet my own life on that.
451	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
452	Intercom	Dr. Reid to room 402. Then down to 201. Then back up to room 403.
453	Turk	I'm nervous, man. Why am I nervous?
454	Todd	Todd's your wing-man, buddy. I will not leave your side. Hey, baby.
455	Carla	Keep moving, frat boy.
456	Todd	You got it.
457	Carla	Come on. Out with it.
458	Turk	Don't rush me!I mean... You shouldn't be impatient with what I think is the opportunity of a lifetime.
459	Carla	Mmm. Okay, so I'm gonna go sit down because, you're so sexy, my knees are weak.
460	Turk	Really?
461	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
462	J.D.	Oh, Dr. Cox, I know I'm being annoying. But I I'm really getting used to talking to patients. I mean, this is why I became a doctor; right? Right?
463	Dr. Cox	I heard "I know I'm being annoying," and then...white noise.
464	J.D.	Will, the pneumonia patient, I got him to quit smoking.
465	Dr. Cox	Forever?
466	J.D.	Yuh-huh!
467	Dr. Cox	No "last one"? 'Cause the last ones are better than sex, trust me, I've had about a thousand of them.
468	J.D.	Done forever. He swore to me. I just, I reached him! I reached him.
469	Dr. Cox	You're having a big day, there, Susan.
470	Janitor	Private party.
471	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
472	J.D.'s Thoughts	Gotta get right back up on the horse.
473	J.D.	Dr. Cox, about Will.
474	Dr. Cox	Not now. I have a ten-minute break, and my soap is on.Hey, uh, skeetch, if you do go ahead and change the channels, I swear I'll suture your hands together.
475	J.D.	Right, so with Will....
476	Dr. Cox	Oh, this woman is just fantastic. I mean, the breasts are probably fake, but, by God, those tears are real!
477	J.D.'s Thoughts	Time for a bold move.
478	J.D.	I need to know how we're going to fix this thing with Will.
479	Dr. Cox	Do you know what you've just done? You just lost all lap-dog privileges.
480	J.D.	Excuse me?
481	Dr. Cox	No more walkies, no more treats, no more following me around the hospital.
482	J.D.	I'm not your lap-dog.
483	Dr. Cox	Hey you, back there, what do we do with lap-dogs who can't behave in the house.
484	Doug	Make them stay outside?
485	Dr. Cox	That's right. You now have five seconds to get out of this room, otherwise I'm gonna start whacking you on the nose with this.Don't laugh. This isn't a joke, newbie. Get. Out.
486	J.D.	But I was thinking that
487	Dr. Cox	GO!What do you wanna watch, there, Captain Courage.
488	Doug	'Days of Our Lives'?
489	Dr. Cox	Atta boy.
490	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
491	J.D.	Come in.
492	Turk	Smells the food.
493	Elliot	Hey, move your butt.Umm... peace offering?Look, Turk, I know that I don't always make the best first impression....Or second, for that matter. Anyway, I'd like us to be friends, and I thought, you know, maybe I could get to know you a bit better........See what you're about.... Uh....For instance, when did you meet Morgan Freeman?
494	Turk	That's my mom.
495	Elliot	I like her freckles!Geez!!!
496	J.D.	Rowdy, no!So, I still can't figure out why Dr. Cox tore me a new one today.
497	Turk	Oh, man, enough already. He's a jerk.
498	Elliot	He's a jerk.
499	Cut to	The Hospital...
500	Doug	He's a jerk!
501	Dr. Kelso	He's a jerk.
502	Janitor	You're a jerk.
503	Carla	He's just Dr. Cox.He's always like that.
504	J.D.	Well, who really knows him? I mean, who does he hang out with here?
505	Carla	No one.
506	J.D.'s Thoughts	That must be lonely.
507	Carla	"Take two Turks as needed, apply to sensitive area..." Who wrote this?
508	Turk	Whazzup.... Oh, come on, Carla; give me one good reason why you won't go out with me.
509	Carla	Well, you're a surgeon. So, you've got the god-complex, the cockiness, the whole "married to the job" thing. You're cute, but you're very, very aware of it. You have no idea what I'm like, so all of your feelings for me are coming from down there. But most of all, I'm looking for the real thing; and you're nothing but a little boy who's not used to being told "No." So there's a bunch of reasons. Pick your favorite.
510	J.D.	I'd go with the "god-complex".But it's hard to choose, you know, they're all so good.
511	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
512	J.D.'s Narration	A hospital is a tricky place. I mean, it's very cliquey, and you have to watch what you say. It's a lot like high school.I'd like to think that if I didn't have somewhere else to be that I'd gone and sat with her. But, you see, tonight, there's somebody else I have to take care of.
513	Cut to	J.D., in casual clothes, with a 6-pack in hand, approaching the door of an apartment. He rings the bell. The door opens to reveal Dr. Cox. The sounds of a televised sporting event can be heard from inside the apartment.
514	J.D.	I know that watching Will slowly kill himself hurts you, too. That's even harder if you don't have anyone to talk about it with. So, when I got off work, I figured you know I was gonna pick up a few cold ones, right, and then maybe you and I, we'll we'll talk it out, we'll just break the whole thing down. Right? What do you say to that?
515	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
516	Elliot	I'm sick of this, everyone keeps ignoring me. I'm like a damn plague around here.
517	Turk	Please, don't look back at me when you're talking.
518	Dr. Kelso	Oh, uh, Dr. Reid. I just wanted to say you're out of my dog house. That was a great catch on that patient with meningoccocus.
519	Elliot	Well, that actually wasn't me, sir. Carla noticed the rash on his legs.
520	Dr. Kelso	Well, that's fascinating. You could have fallen back into my good graces, and instead you passed the credit on to a nurse.How noble! I'll tell you what, I'll get the cafeteria staff to write "Was it worth it?" on a big cake for you!
521	Turk	Nurses' Station.... So this is the Nurses' Station....
522	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
523	J.D.	Do you think I've damaged the ligaments?
524	Dr. Cox	I don't care.Now, can I count on you to never drop by here ever again, or should I just go ahead and move?
525	J.D.	Oh, you can't leave a place with this much warmth. I especially love the shelf filled with personal photos of your friends and family.
526	Shot of	A very sterile-looking glass shelf with several "blank" pieces of modern art.
527	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, if he comes at you, just try and roll out the door.
528	Dr. Cox	Well, actually, you have a point. I guess watching the game by yourself with a scotch isn't, really, the only way to watch a game, huh. I don't know. I just, I've always thought of needing people as a sign of weakness.
529	J.D.	It's not.
530	Dr. Cox	Then, would you stay... and watch the game with me? Maybe have a slice of pizza?
531	J.D.	Of course I will.
532	Dr. Cox	I can braid your hair.No, I know the couch isn't very deep, but we can move the back cushion... and spoon.Hey, guys, whatta ya say. Beer and chips in the back.Just ignore them. Will you tell me the answer to this question: Do you want to be the big spoon, or the little spoon?
533	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
534	Turk	I'm telling ya, Kelso didn't even ask, and she gave you full credit.
535	Carla	I don't care. Too little, too late. Plus, I know why you're really here. So, I'm gonna park myself right here in the "V.I.P section," so you can give me what'cha got.
536	Turk	I was gonna tell you how I busted J.D.'s chops the other day for wanting to be friends with a girl. And now I find it so amazing to see how strong you are, how well you carry yourself, how I'd give anything just to wake up in the morning and watch you read the paper. But instead, I think you should hop off your broom for a second, try and remember what it was like when you first started here, and give Elliot a break. Because she may be a chore, but she is a good person. Your ass is especially fine today.
537	Carla	Pick me up tomorrow at seven.
538	Turk	She's not the only one that can do a speech. I can do a speech.
539	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
540	Dr. Cox	You are to return that umbrella to me at the hospital, not here, is that clear?Hey, newbie. You know what your problem is?
541	J.D.	My bones hurt?
542	Dr. Cox	You were gonna, what, rescue me from loneliness with a three-dollar six-pack of light beer? It turns out, you can't save people from themselves, newbie. We just treat 'em. You treat that kid with a respiratory problem, and when he comes back with cancer, go ahead and treat that, too.
543	J.D.	Well, thanks for the pick-me-up!
544	Dr. Cox	Hey! Smokers, drinkers, druggies, fatties, whatever. All I'm saying is that if you keep living and dying on whether or not a person changes, well... you're not gonna make it as a doctor, that's all. Now... come here and gimme a hug.It's okay. Come here...Come here.Aw, get outta here! And take this piss-water with you. It's embarrassing to have it here.
545	Cox's Buddy	I'll drink it!
546	Dr. Cox	Eh! I'll take the beer. You beat it.
547	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
548	Turk	Go apologize.
549	Carla	No, I don't wanna.
550	Turk	Okay, come on, come on, come on. Just do it really fast, like a Band-Aid.
551	Carla	Here, I wrote out the pharmacy renewals on all your patients.
552	Elliot	Wow. Great! Hey, you know what else would be really helpful...
553	J.D.'s Narration	I think the one thing we never stop looking for is acceptance.
554	Elliot	Thank you, Carla.
555	Carla	You're welcome.
556	J.D.'s Narration	Acceptance of our own shortcomings...
557	Elliot	So, when's the baby due?
558	Female Patient	What baby?
559	J.D.'s Narration	...Acceptance that some things are gonna be what they're gonna be.
560	Will	This is a strange resort, man. I mean, this wheelchair service is great, but that suite I rented... there's another person in it. And for some reason, the bellhop gave me an enema.
561	J.D.	Yeah... he's new here.
562	Will	So... anything you wanna say?
563	J.D.	You know it all, man.
564	J.D.'s Narration	Still, I hated Will a little.......'Cause, thanks to him, I started to look at all the people who were important to me in terms of what will probably kill them.Heart Disease...Liver disease...Somebody choking her...I dunno... Probably stress.
565	Dr. Cox	Say anything else to him?
566	J.D.	Nope.
567	Dr. Cox	But you wanted to.
568	J.D.	Yeah, but you told me not
569	Dr. Cox	Geez, J.D., would you be a man? Lookit, if you can't stick to your convictions, you'll never make it as a doctor.I can't believe your head exploded. If your head explodes, you'll never make it as a doctor. I mean, come on, you look ridiculous.
570	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
571	J.D.'s Thoughts	I don't know why I came to watch Turk in surgery when I could've caught a few minutes of sleep. I guess I just haven't seen much of my best friend, lately. Still, it's not like I'm desperate or anything.
572	Dr. Wen	Look, I've been attending here for three years. What makes you think you know better?
573	Turk	In my gut, I know I'm right.
574	Dr. Wen	We need to make this decision now!
575	Turk	Fine, then, it's on you.
576	Dr. Wen	Yes, it is! Nurse Erasure!
577	Nurse	Yes, doctor.
578	Mr. Bidwell	I hate this song!
579	Turk	Me too, man. Me too.
580	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
581	J.D.'s Narration	It's weird, but a hospital room can actually be a romantic place. Maybe it's the soft green glow of a heart monitor, or the way the moonlight reflects off a bedpan....
582	Elliot	Our shifts keep overlapping on Friday nights.
583	J.D.	It's the closest thing I've had to a date, recently.
584	Elliot	Well, I had a great time tonight.
585	J.D.	Oh, yeah, me too. So... can I page you?
586	Elliot	You better. And don't do the whole two-day waiting thing.
587	J.D.	Oh, baby, I don't play by the rules.
588	Elliot	Well, uh, goodnight....
589	J.D.'s Thoughts	Wait a second, is she joking? 'Cause if she's joking and I kiss her...Of course, if she's not joking...
590	Elliot	Come on, I don't do this for all the doctors.
591	J.D.'s Thoughts	Yes!
592	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
593	Dr. Cox	Look, this guy's gonna need 40 MAQ's of KCL; and go ahead and grab me when you get the results.
594	J.D.	You got it.
595	Dr. Cox	Oh, and his TV is broken, so, when you two do start tagging each other , least you can do is wake him up and let him watch.
596	J.D.'s Narration	In my experience, when two friends miss an opportunity like this, you've got exactly forty-eight hours to get the kiss....Otherwise, one of you is gonna over-think it okay, she's gonna over-think it and then you end up permanently stuck in "The Friend Zone."
597	Elliot	I'll see ya.
598	Patient	You're such a girl.
599	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
600	J.D.	So, nothing was going on last night between me and Elliot.
601	Dr. Cox	Good thing you still have your 'flower', then.
602	Turk	That song... is like a virus!
603	J.D.	I'm just a little lonely, you know; I guess 'cause I haven't really been hanging out with Turk since he's been dating Carla.
604	Dr. Cox	First of all, who's Turk? And don't answer. Look, if you have a medical question for me, I'm forced by hospital policy to answer you. However, if you ask me about a personal problem, I'm going to start doing this:
605	Janitor	You seem unhappy.I like that.

607	Turk	"I try to discover... a little something to make me sweeter. Oh, baby refrain " I cannot get that stupid song out of my head. It's like a damn virus. Okay, here's his chart , his transfer note; he's hemodynamically stable. Consider him officially turfed to Medicine.
608	Todd	T-Man, I'm gonna get my grub on.
609	Turk	Means he's gonna go eat.
610	J.D.	Ahhh. So, surgery went okay?
611	Turk	Yeah, it was cool; it was cool.Dude, I got to close for the first time, ever. Ever! The human body is so disgusting!Oh, not yours. Yours is stunning!
612	J.D.	We should go out and celebrate, you know, tear it up like we used to do; just the two of us.
613	Turk	And that would come before Part B...
614	J.D.	That's what... we used to tear it up...We should probably never do that again.
615	Janitor	"Oh, baby, please.... Give a little respect.... To me."

617	J.D.'s Thoughts	Don't let it be awkward. Do something cute; cover her eyes and say, "Guess who!"
618	J.D.	Guess who!
619	Elliot	I can't breathe.
620	Dr. Kelso	Okay, gang, it's time for rounds.Let's see who's 'The Weakest Link'!"The weakest link".... Now then, uh, Dr.... Simotas; the severe swelling of the lips exhibited by this patient might be an indication of what?
621	Dr. Simodes	Angio-edema.
622	Dr. Kelso	Well done... sport. And what treatment would you recommend, uh, Dr... uh, Dorian.
623	J.D.	A combination of steroids and any of several anti-histamines.
624	Dr. Kelso	Atta boy, sport.Now, then, what would you recommend the patient stay away from, uh, Dr... Reid?
625	Elliot	My first guess would be, uh, shellfish.
626	Dr. Kelso	Right you are, sweetheart.
627	Elliot	'Sweetheart'?
628	J.D.'s Narration	I could kinda see what was going on in Elliot's head.
629	Dr. Kelso	Right you are, sweetheart. Mmm...hmm...hmm.

631	Cut to interior	Living Room.
632	Turk	What do you wanna watch?
633	J.D.	"Fletch".
634	Turk	"Fletch" it is.
635	Carla	Seen it.
636	Turk	Well, you haven't seen it with us saying all the lines.
637	Carla	I'm so lucky I found you.
638	J.D.	Maybe next time, her mom could come.
639	Turk	Dude, you won't even know she's here. Well, except, she laughs at stupid stuff sometimes, and that kinda makes me laugh It's stup because it's so stupiOh, come on, tonight's still about us.
640	J.D.	Whatever, I don't care.
641	Carla	Turk? You wanna go hang out in your room?
642	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
643	Elliot	On the one hand, I know Dr. Kelso doesn't mean anything by it. And, okay, maybe I am kind of a sweetheart....
644	Dr. Cox	I'm sleeping.
645	Elliot	On the other hand, it just sounds so demeaning! You know?
646	Dr. Cox	Mother of God, you're not listening to a word I'm saying, are you.
647	Elliot	I mean, it's not like he's my grandpa or anything. Anyway J.D. always tells me how you've helped him out...
648	Dr. Cox	Well, he obviously hasn't told you about my ear-flicking policy, has he. Look! This whole "groovy guidance counselor" thing you people seem to have working is a total fantasy. I'm not that guy, you can go and ask anybody. Now, you've got to leave me alone, or I'll punish you.
649	Elliot	I guess "sweetheart" is kind of innocuous.
650	Dr. Cox	Okay! Here's what you're gonna do: Go right down there and confront Kelso.
651	Elliot	Really?
652	Dr. Cox	Oh, absolutely! Nevermind that he is the Chief of Medicine for the entire hospital; he'll have a whole new level of respect for you!
653	Elliot	Honestly?
654	Dr. Cox	Yes! You can't have sexist terms like that floating around here. You go get him.

657	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
658	J.D.	Uhh... And an aspirin.
659	J.D.'s Narration	A lot of my work has become second nature to me.
660	Turk	Look, man, I'm surgery, and you're Medicine. This isn't college anymore; things have to change.
661	J.D.	Well, I know relationships change, I just thought yours and mine never would.
662	Turk	What's goin' on with you, man?
663	J.D.	Well, we always look out for each other.... I guess I just don't feel like you have my back anymore.
664	Turk	You really feel that way?
665	J.D.	Yeah, I do.Sure
666	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
667	Lawyer	Legally, there's a huge difference. When you stitch a patient, wind up sewing a sheet to him, that's an accident. When he tries getting up, the whole gurney collapses, breaking his front teeth, that's a lawsuit. Say it with me: Accident. Lawsuit.
668	Group	Accident. Lawsuit.
669	Dr. Kelso	So, what is it, sweetheart?
670	Elliot	It's that, it's the sweetheart thing. It just doesn't hit me right. I'm a doctor, and it seems sort of... disrespectful.
671	Dr. Kelso	Oh? I've always called the young men "sport" and the young women "sweetheart".
672	Elliot	But, you called Becky "sport".
673	Dr. Kelso	Oh... Well, I am so sorry.... Sport.It must be one of those bad habits I've developed after working in the medical field for over thirty years.
674	Elliot	Th-thirty years? But... you look so young!
675	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
676	J.D.'s Narration	It's never easy to see a patient that's getting worse instead of better. In fact, that's kind of the opposite of what we're going for.
677	J.D.	I don't get it, he was fine last night. Now he's diaphoretic, he's in and out of consciousness. He might even be septic.
678	Nurse Roberts	Well, we won't know anything until the lab gets his blood-work back.
679	J.D.'s Thoughts	If he's septic, there's a chance they'll have to reopen this guy. 'Course, there's also a chance he could die.
680	Nurse Roberts	I've seen this before. Gauze, sponges some young surgeon left something in this man.
681	J.D.	Noo. No. I know the guy that closed, he'd never be that careless.
682	Turk	'Kay, uh... Excuse me, sorry; has anyone seen my keys? No? Okay, how about my wallet? Anyone?
683	J.D.	I've never seen that before.

690	Janitor	Yeah. I saw him. He just went out that door.

694	Elliot	Well, Mr. Kavanaugh, your arrhythmia is much better. Everything looks just great, actually.
695	Mr. Kavanaugh	You sound surprised.
696	Elliot	Well, okay, it has nothing to do with you; but I had a little run-in with Dr. Kelso yesterday, so, when he switched me over to you, I just thought it would be a difficult case.
697	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
698	Mr. Kavanaugh	Go on, I'm listening.

701	J.D.	Hey! Turk! I gotta talk

704	Turk	Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Look, it's 9-up. okay? We just lost our fourth, it's your ball.
705	J.D.	Look. it's very important that I talk to you, man.
706	Turk	This is not a joke, either! It's real, man; it's Surgical versus Medical. Your ball You're Shirts, come on.
707	Todd	Let's play, let's play.
708	J.D.'s Narration	And there it was, everything was more important than me now.
709	Becky	Don't bring in the same weak-ass crap the last kid did!
710	J.D.'s Narration	Suddenly, I was so fed up, I decided to teach Turk and Todd a lesson right there on the court.......You know, once I warmed up a little.
711	Turk	J.D., I'ma show you what the deal's oh, oh, oh, ohh...All right, that's game. What's so important?
712	J.D.	Okay, I was looking at Bidwell...
713	Turk	One second.Damn! I gotta go. But you played a good game! You played a good game!
714	Todd	I thought you sucked.

718	Dr. Kelso	Yes?
719	Elliot	Sorry to bother you, sir.
720	Dr. Kelso	Well.... if it isn't "Sport."How are things? Did you... see Mr. Kavanaugh today?
721	Elliot	Yes...Yes.... I did. Dr. Kelso, I just wanted to say that, well, as far as the whole "sweetheart" thing goes, maybe I overreacted.
722	Dr. Kelso	Are you sure? Because I wouldn't want you to be the least bit uncomfortable.
723	Elliot	To tell you the truth, I have no idea what possessed me to say anything in the first place.
724	Dr. Cox	You've got to leave me alone, or I'll punish you.
725	Elliot	Yeah, absolutely no idea.
726	Dr. Kelso	Super. Then run along, sweetheart."I try to discover.... a little something to make me sweeter...."
727	Cut to	The Nurses' Station
728	Carla	"....Oh, baby refrain from breaking my heart. I'm so in love with "
729	J.D.	Have you seen Mr. Bidwell's blood work?
730	Carla	Um... no, it hasn't come back yet.
731	J.D.	Okay.... Have you seen Turk?
732	Carla	Not since this morning.
733	J.D.	Well, I'm sure you'll end up seeing him before I do, so....
734	Carla	Bambi? Are you giving me attitude?
735	J.D.	What if I am?
736	Carla	Sweetie, you have to be a minority sidekick in a bad movie to pull that off. You know what I'm talking about, right?Explain it to this man, please.First, you do the head, then you do the finger, then you talk through the nose......And then you give a lot of attitude. That's how it works. But if you're not from there, you don't understand, so I'm not gonna even 'axe' you
737	J.D.	Okay, I'm gonna leave now.

741	J.D.	Hi, how are ya? I have a quick legal question. What if, hypothetically
742	Lawyer	Oh, God, you killed somebody!
743	J.D.	Noooo!
744	Lawyer	Someone else did!
745	J.D.	No, no; no one killed anyone.
746	Lawyer	...Maimed, mutilated, disfigured.... Let's not split hairs.
747	J.D.	No, no, I'm not even sure there is a problem. I'm running tests, I'm doing everything that I should be doing.
748	Lawyer	Look, if you know about something, by not reporting it you're every bit as culpable. Now, is there anything that you'd like to tell me?
749	J.D.'s Thoughts	Why am I protecting Turk when he can't even give me five seconds of his time?
750	Lawyer	Anything at all?
751	J.D.'s Thoughts	Tell him.

755	Elliot	Dr. Cox.
756	Dr. Cox	I'm hoping, for your sake, there's another Dr. Cox sitting right behind me.
757	Elliot	I feel stupid, but, sending me to Kelso like that well, I'm not sure, exactly, what you were trying to teach me.
758	Dr. Cox	The value and this is important of leaving me alone.
759	Elliot	I think we both know there was a little more to it than that.
760	Dr. Cox	No, no, no, there's not! Look...I want you to spread the word, missy I've. Had. Enough. The next whiny intern that comes in here looking to me for a cookie and a hug, I swear to Aisha, I'm going to hurt them. And you, you neurotic, one-woman freak-show, take your "Blah-blah" to the blah-blah-ologist. Because if you are so stupid as to confront the Chief of Medicine over some quasi-offensive endearment, then you've just got to go ahead and replace the captain of your brainship, because he's drunk at the wheel.
761	Elliot	You're right. I need to learn to pick my battles! Thank you, sir.

768	J.D.	Negative? How could they be negative? The guy looks like death.
769	Mr. Bidwell	Hi!
770	J.D.	What happened?
771	Carla	There's no infection. He's diabetic; so when someone gave him insulin during post-op, when he wasn't eating, he became hypoglycemic.
772	J.D.	Oh, that's funny, because the only person who coulda given him insulin...
773	J.D.'s Thoughts	Uh-oh.
774	J.D.	Me!I gave him insulin!
775	J.D.'s Thoughts	Twice!
776	Carla	Well, he's fine, Bambi. I gave him an amp? of D-50 and he's eating, now. But you should probably give him a glass of orange juice in about an hour.
777	J.D.	Thank you so much. You totally saved my ass.
778	Carla	Well, it wasn't me....
779	J.D.	Look, Turk....
780	Turk	Come on, man; you know I always got your back.
781	J.D.	I know.
782	J.D.'s Thoughts	Just tell him how you feel without sounding like a girl, for once.
783	J.D.	I miss you so much it hurts, sometimes.
784	Turk	Okay, um, you've had a rough day, so I'm gonna let that go for now.
785	J.D.	Thank you.
786	Turk	Look, we're gonna find time to hang, man. It's just that we're both really swamped right now, and I'm hanging out with Carla a lot, I know... But tell me, if there was someone you were into, you wouldn't be doing the same thing.
787	J.D.	Oh, crap!
788	Turk	Did Nurse Roberts sell you these?
789	Elliot	You don't even want to hear about the day I've had.
790	J.D.	You're right. Kiss me.

792	J.D.	Well, we can wait like, three, four seconds.
793	Elliot	No, I just ate, I feel gross.
794	J.D.	Not gross, pretty. Come here.
795	Elliot	J.D., can we just... talk for a second?
796	J.D.'s Thoughts	It never fails.
797	Guy #1	Went to high school with her.
798	Guy #2	We worked at Penguin's Yogurt.
799	Guy #3	Met her on a bus.
800	Becky	She'll come around.
801	Guy #1	Pretzel?
802	J.D.	Thank you.
803	Elliot	The first few weeks here have been so hard for me, mentally, physically, emotionally. It's like math camp all over again. Not that I've ever been to math camp it's just an expression.
804	J.D.	I use it all the time.Come on.
805	J.D.'s Narration	I know the idea of choosing friendship over sex is the last thing any guy wants to hear. But you know what? This time, it actually made sense to me.
806	Cut to	Turk and J.D.'s Apartment.
807	J.D.'s Narration	...Besides, I challenge anyone to survive as an intern without a close group of friends to lean on.
808	J.D.	I cant believe you lost our bottle opener.
809	Turk	Yeah, I know.... I miss it so much, it hurts sometimes.

814	Carla	No, I don't wanna let it go. It's a simple question why wouldn't I want to go to the symphony?
815	Elliot	No, I I I didn't mean anything by it.
816	Carla	Of course you meant something by it.
817	J.D.	We've got to do something about this.
818	Turk	No.... We really don't.
819	J.D.	Come on, Carla's your girlfriend, Elliot's my friend....
820	Turk	Dude, trust me, don't get involved.
821	Carla	So, if she's from el barrio, she must not like music.
822	Elliot	All I'm saying is that classical music isn't for everyone.
823	Carla	Ohh, so because I didn't grow up with a nanny changing my Vera Wang diapYou got something to say?
824	Turk	Mm-mm.
825	J.D.	Well, yes, frankly, I think that you're being condescending and you're being overly sensitive.'Scuse me for a second... just one second.

835	Elliot	Hi, I'm gonna be your doctor.
836	J.D.	Hello? I'm the doctor!I'm...I'm...I'm the doctor.

840	Woman	I should we should have gone to my doctor.
841	Mrs. Tanner	Now that's enough! Now, sure, he's young, but he's probably a very good doctor. Are you a good doctor?
842	J.D.	It's kinda too soon to tell.
843	Mrs. Tanner	Honesty.... Well, I like that. You probably want these people to wait outside.
844	J.D.	That'd be nice.
845	Mrs. Tanner	Make 'em know you're a man, not a boy.
846	J.D.	Uhh... would you guys mind....

869	Turk	No, I don't know. Please, let me get my sweat on.
870	J.D.'s Narration	Surgeons generally don't like to get too close to patients. Maybe it makes it harder to cut someone open... maybe it's just too risky... I dunno.
871	J.D.	I feel like you're missing out. Like, this Mrs. Tanner, she's got this...incredible energy and...and warmth.
872	Turk	Dude, the League of Women Voters called and they want to know where to send your membership info.
873	J.D.	You're using that "somebody called" joke a lot.
874	Turk	I know, I can't help it. I got a hernia patient to take care of.
875	J.D.	What's his name?
876	Turk	Well, his name is Hernia Patient, but we've gotten close so I like to call him "Hernia".

878	Turk	Shut up.

880	Elliot	I paged Dr. Cox and he should be here any second.What'd she say?
881	Carla	Oh, she said she thinks it's amazing that your fancy private school didn't teach you any Spanish, considering that a third of your patients speak it as a primary language.
882	Elliot	Oh, yeah, like every doctor here speaks Spanish.
883	Dr. Cox	Hola, Señora Guerrero! Como se siente hoy?
884	Mrs. Guerrero	...no muy bien.
885	Dr. Cox	Ah, bueno. What now, Dr. Barbie?
886	Elliot	Mrs. Guerrero's a forty-year-old Lupus patient who presented with shortness of breath; so I started her on a Heparin drip and ordered a VQ scan. I just wanted to run that by you
887	Dr. Cox	One, two, three
888	Elliot	So should I continue with the Hep
889	Dr. Cox	It's really important that you let me get to ten.
890	Elliot	Well, I just thought
891	Dr. Cox	Listen, cookie, you've been here over a month. This is Medicine 101: I don't want every little thing run by me; I don't wanna give you my two cents' worth. But if you ever do wanna know my opinion, rest assured it will always be that you're an incredible pain and that every time I see your kew-pie-doll face, it just makes me wanna pick you up and shake you until all the hours of my life that you've wasted...fall out. Now laugh.

924	Guy	Oh, here's the party.
925	J.D.	Look, I don't know how it's been with your other doctors, but when you're under my care, you stay in the hospital until I say it's okay for you to leave.
926	Mrs. Tanner	We saved you a plate.
927	J.D.	I don't care about food right now!
928	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, my God, are those s'mores?
929	Mrs. Tanner	Look, it's Samantha's fifth birthday. Now you're not gonna make me miss this, are you?
930	J.D.	Couldn't you have got her a big cake?
931	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
932	Elliot	I'm gonna order an ABG just to be safe.... Don't you think?
933	Carla	Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
934	Elliot	Hey, teach me to tell her she's doing fine.
935	Carla	Um... okay. Say, um, "Esta...progresando...muy bien."
936	Elliot	Mrs. Guerrero? Um... esta...progresando...m-muy bien.
937	Mrs. Guerrero	Ah! Gracias.
938	Elliot	Ooh! It worked!

940	Turk	All right, listen, the important thing to remember is this is not gonna hurt as much as you think.
941	David	I'm ready.
942	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
943	J.D.	Okay, you know what, Mrs. Tanner....
944	Mrs. Tanner	Just until Samantha blows out her candles. What are you gonna wish for, honey? Uhhhhm.... a bike?
945	Samantha	Nope.
946	Mrs. Tanner	A doll house?
947	Samantha	Nope.
948	J.D.	How about the ability to make quick decisions?
949	Samantha	Umm... Nope.
950	J.D.	How 'bout this?
951	Mrs. Tanner	Uh, a pony!
952	Samantha	No!
953	J.D.	Okay, enough of this. I don't think any of you realize how serious this is. Right now we need to be worried about your mother, your grandmother... your....I'm sorry, we we haven't met, I'm Dr. Dorian.
954	Mrs. Tanner	You're very cute.
955	J.D.	Thank you. Come on, let's go.
956	Mrs. Tanner	Candles are still lit.
957	J.D.	Okay, here we go.Blow!
958	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
959	Elliot	I increased the Heparin to 1500 units per hour. Does...that sound like enough?
960	Carla	Should be.
961	Elliot	Speaking of Heparin, have you slept with Turk yet?
962	Carla	What!?
963	Elliot	I'm sorry, I'm no, I'm sorry... too personal.
964	Carla	I like to wait. I like a guy to want it so bad he basically thinks he isn't gonna get it ever.Then when he's lost the will to live, that's when I jump him.
965	Elliot	So, how long does that usually
966	Carla	A month, maybe two. What about you?
967	Elliot	I like to use sex as an ice-breaker.
968	Carla	Ah. And how's that working out for you?
969	Elliot	I guess I don't have what you would call high self-esteem.

971	Dr. Wen	Let me know when you find the hernia.
972	Turk	You got it.
973	Girl	We're so lost.
974	Turk	We're not lost.
975	Girl	Go left, here.
976	Turk	It's a right.
977	Girl	You passed his Cooper's ligament three times already. Just stop and ask for directions!
978	Turk	Do you want to drive this thing? 'Cause I will pull I will pull this thing over and let you drive this thing!
979	Dr. Wen	Wait a second. Go back to where you just were.
980	Turk	What is that?
981	Cut to	Mrs. Guerrero's Room
982	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
983	Carla	Hey. Her O sat's in the eighties; and take a look at her heart rate.
984	Elliot	Shoot.
985	Cut to	Mrs. Tanner's Room.
986	J.D.	So, that's basically it. Your kidneys aren't responding to the medication anymore. I'm afraid we're gonna have to start you on dialysis.
987	Mrs. Tanner	Oh, I'm not a big fan of dialysis.
988	J.D.	Yeah, unfortunately we don't really have a choice.
989	Mrs. Tanner	Well, actually, I do have a choice.
990	J.D.'s Narration	Certain things you never expect to come out of a person's mouth.
991	Mrs. Tanner	I think I'm ready to die.
992	Delivery Man	I've got a ton of bricks for Dr. Dorian?Could I get that pen back?
993	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
994	Mrs. Tanner	You're gonna have to shut your mouth at some point.Sweetie, I'm seventy-four years old, I'm ready to go.
995	J.D.	Yeah, but with dialysis, you could live another...eighty or ninety years.
996	Mrs. Tanner	I think you're being a little irrational.
997	J.D.	No I'm not.
998	Mrs. Tanner	Everybody dies sometime.
999	J.D.	No they don't.
1000	Cut to	The Nurses' Station.
1001	Turk	Actually, sir, I think we're really lucky we found the lymphoma when we did. ... ... 'Course. ... No, yeah, I'll wait for you to get here before I tell David anything. ... ... Okay, see you soon.
1002	Dr. Kelso	Gosh, sport, I sure hope you're not using that phone to make a personal call.
1003	Turk	No, actually, sir, that was David Morrison's father. He's a patient of mine. Dave's a good kid.
1004	Dr. Kelso	Well, he sounds terrific; you two are becoming best pals, huh? Well, you know what we should do? The three of us should play ourselves a game of stickball.
1005	Turk	Sir?
1006	Dr. Kelso	Sure, all we need is a stick and a ball and a pocketful of dreams. Or, we could take turns bowling your patient down the hallways of my hospital.
1007	Turk	Okay, listen, sir, I can explain. That's
1008	Dr. Kelso	Spare me.
1009	Turk	Spare you! That's good, sir... 'cause of the bowling thing. That's You're not making a joke are you.
1010	Dr. Kelso	Not at the moment.
1011	Turk	I just think he's a good kid, and I really thought he needed a friend.
1012	Dr. Kelso	Young man, your patients don't need friends; they need a doctor.
1013	Cut to	Another Hallway.
1014	Elliot	Her BP's dropping; maybe it's time to push thrombolitics. If you were her doctor, what would you do?
1015	Carla	That's way out of my league, Elliot!
1016	Elliot	I don't know about waiting; I mean, she seems to be decompensating. But, thrombolitics scare me. I mean, a lot of times, the patient bleeds out.
1017	Carla	She needs to know what's going on.
1018	Elliot	Uh... I'll be right back.
1019	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
1020	Dr. Cox	So, she doesn't want dialysis?
1021	J.D.	Yeah, what does that mean, I mean
1022	Dr. Cox	Well, if she doesn't want dialysis, then there is no ethical dilemma.
1023	J.D.	But what about our duty as doctors to do everything in our power to help pe
1024	Dr. Cox	'What about our duty as doctors?' Look. This has nothing to do with the patient it's all about you. You are afraid of death, and you can't be. You're in medicine, you gotta accept the fact that everything we do here everything is a stall. We're just trying to keep the game going; that's it. But, ultimately, it always ends up the same way.
1025	Grim Reaper	I win.
1026	J.D.	Where, I don't see?
1027	Grim Reaper	Here , diagonally.
1028	J.D.	Pretty sneaky, Death!
1029	Dr. Cox	Hope I helped.
1030	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
1031	David	So that Dr. Kelso guy really came down on you, huh?
1032	Turk	Yeah, but he's got a point, this is a hospital it's not a playground.Well, if it's not the medulla oblongata. That's about fifty points, there, wouldn't you say? I won? I'll just take your fruit cup and be on my way.
1033	David	I talked to my dad, today.He's coming out.
1034	Turk	Cool.
1035	David	And that, uh, that nurse came by to shave me again.
1036	Turk	Hey, I didn't tell her to do that.
1037	David	You didn't?
1038	Turk	No; I think she's got a crush on you.
1039	David	Come on, dude, what's going on?
1040	Turk	Okay... Uh, here's the deal....
1041	Cut to	Mrs. Tanner's Room
1042	J.D.'s Thoughts	She's telling her family. There's nothing that could make me go in there right now.
1043	J.D.	You didn't tell them, did you.
1044	Mrs. Tanner	It didn't come up. Look, they don't need that burden; besides, they'd just give me a bunch of reasons to change my mind.
1045	J.D.	Speaking of which, I took the liberty of jotting down a few things I think everybody should do at least once in their life.
1046	Mrs. Tanner	Oh, no.
1047	J.D.	Okay. "Number One: Eat a sausage-and-pepper hoagie from Enrico's."
1048	Mrs. Tanner	Well, of course I've done that.
1049	J.D.	"Number Two: Go to Asia."
1050	Mrs. Tanner	Gonenn kan kurai Kyoto ni sunnde imashita.
1051	J.D.	I'm gonna take that as a yes, and I'll also check off "Learn a foreign language".
1052	Mrs. Tanner	Mm-hmm.
1053	Cut to	The Darkened Doctor's Lounge.
1054	Carla	What the hell happened to "I'll be right back"? I can't believe I actually started to think I've been wrong about you. That woman needs her doctor to tell her something, anything, and you run away? Are you even gonna look at me?
1055	Elliot	Oh, I've been trying to decide what drink to get. I've been standing here trying to choose between cherry soda and, uh, ginger ale. And you know what? It's a toss-up. I mean, either way I get a cold drink, right? And it would be almost impossible for me to kill someone with this decision, but... I still can't make it. I think I'm in trouble here.
1056	Carla	Look, I don't think these kinds of decisions are easy for anyone. And if it's any consolation, one of the reasons I never liked you is because you're already better at this than most of the doctors that come through here; and to be honest, I kinda liked being the only smart, strong chick in the joint.
1057	Elliot	You sort of just complimented me.
1058	Carla	Little bit.
1059	Elliot	Okay, I'm gonna have a ginger ale.
1060	Carla	Good start.
1061	Elliot	And...that clot isn't going anywhere on its own; so, let's push the thrombolitics.
1062	Carla	Okay.
1063	Elliot	Here we go.
1064	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
1065	J.D.	"Go to the top of the Eiffel Tower."
1066	Mrs. Tanner	Done.
1067	J.D.	Fine. "Go to the top of the Meiffel Tower."
1068	Mrs. Tanner	Oh, now you're making stuff up.
1069	J.D.	No, I'm not; it's right here, you can look at it!
1070	Mrs. Tanner	Listen, Dr. Dorian, there's not one thing I regret as I lay here right now. I'm ready. I really am.
1071	J.D.	You have had an amazing life.
1072	Mrs. Tanner	Good, then we agree. Now, aren't there other patients you need to be seeing?
1073	J.D.	Me? No, no, I've I've been off for two hours.
1074	Mrs. Tanner	So, with your precious free time, you've been sitting in a hospital room talking to an old lady. What about your list? How many of those things have you done? For that matter, how many times have you sat in the grass and done nothing, hm?You need to start taking some time for yourself, young man. Promise me you'll do that.
1075	J.D.	I will.
1076	Mrs. Tanner	Good. Now, get outta here. Go on.
1077	J.D.	Yeah, well, let me I just want to check out a few things before I...get going.Uh-huh.... Uhh-huh....
1078	Mrs. Tanner	Are you okay?
1079	J.D.	I'm scared.
1080	Mrs. Tanner	Come here.... Come here.... Come here.You're okay.... You'll be just fine.... Not to worry.

1082	J.D.	I just want you to know that she went very peacefully....
1083	David's Father	I know you did everything you could for my son. I can't tell you how glad I am he had a friend here with him.
1084	Dr. Cox	Don't second guess yourself. You made the right call; you did.
1085	Elliot	I know.
1086	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
1087	J.D.'s Narration	So, they say that one out of every three patients admitted to this place will die here. But, some days the odds are worse than that.
1088	Elliot	I'm really sorry.
1089	Cut to	A Semi-Private Patient's room another day.
1090	J.D.'s Narration	And on days like that, I guess the best you can hope for is that you took something from it.
1091	Turk	Hey, I'm Turk.
1092	J.D.'s Narration	...Anything....
1093	Cut to	The Hallway
1094	J.D.'s Narration	...Anything at all....
1095	Cut to	The Park

1098	J.D.	Hey, how's he doing?
1099	Elliot	Well, he was admitted with neutropenic fever, but his white blood cell count's stabilized. Best I can say is he's not getting any worse.How ya feeling, Jared?
1100	Jared	Okay, I guess.
1101	Elliot	Oh, hey! I heard your dad arranged a visit from The Rock?
1102	Jared	Oh, yeah, I'm thirteen, I must love wrestling, right? Woo-hoo.
1103	Elliot	Oh, come on; The Rock's a movie star! I mean, out of anything in the whole world, what could a guy possibly want to see more.
1104	Louie Anderson	Okay, Guys, we need an answer.Name one thing guys wanna see more than anything in the whole, wide world.
1105	J.D.	Okay, uh, Louie, we're gonna go with "boobs".
1106	Louie Anderson	Show me "boobs"!There they are! Good job!
1107	Jared	I wanna see 'em on a real girl. A cute girl.

1114	Dr. Kelso	Hey, there, sport. Got your page.
1115	Dr. Steadman	This better be good paging the Chief of Medicine.
1116	J.D.'s Narration	Dr. Steadman. Resident, and first-class teacher's pet.
1117	J.D.	I, uh.... Sir, I was going over Mr. Martinez's chart, and it seems like the TIPS procedure he's scheduled for is completely unnecessary.
1118	Dr. Steadman	Why would you think that's unnecessary?
1119	J.D.	Well, he's dead.
1120	Dr. Kelso	Well, excellent catch Dr..... uh... Dr.... uhm....
1121	J.D.'s Thoughts	Dorian. You see me every day. Say my name; say it!
1122	Dr. Kelso	....Martinez.
1123	J.D.	That was the name of the patient, sir.
1124	Dr. Kelso	...Avery.
1125	J.D.	No, actually, that's the that's the manufacturer of the clipboard...sir.
1126	Dr. Kelso	Fine work doctor! Fine work.
1127	J.D.'s Thoughts	I hear that!

1131	Turk	Steady, boy.... Okay, now Rowdy!I swear, when you're not here, he does it.
1132	Carla	Oh, I'm sure he's just shy.
1133	J.D.	I think you should go ahead and do it.
1134	Elliot	I am not flashing my breasts!
1135	J.D.	Why not? It's easy, you just go like this.
1136	Elliot	Ooh, that's hot.
1137	J.D.	Oh, , I went by Pediatrics..... They thought it was funny.
1138	Carla	I'm borrowing a sweatshirt.'Scuse me, what did we agree you would do whenever I left a room?
1139	Turk	Oh, I'm sorry, baby.
1140	Carla	That's better.
1141	Turk	How was that?
1142	J.D.	Ahhhhhh! My man, Turk, is getting it daily, nightly, and ever so rightly!Ah! What up, dude!
1143	J.D.'s Thoughts	Once every 4.2 seconds a man says something stupid that a woman hears and punishes him for....Luckily, this wasn't one of those times.
1144	Carla	What did you just say?
1145	J.D.	"What up...dude?"
1146	Carla	Why would you think that Turk and I slept together? Because I'm a nurse? Because I'm Latina?
1147	J.D.	No, just 'cause you guys have been dating...for a while. Do Latina women put out more? Because that's not something I've I've ever heard.Turk told me.
1148	Turk	No! I didn't! No, I swear. Look, he he assumed.
1149	Carla	Uh-huh. And did you correct him?
1150	Turk	Well, you know, I've been really busy at the hospital lately....
1151	Carla	Is that how you see this relationship, as some mad dash to the finish line? Because I'll take you into that bedroom right now; and I promise you, you will be walking sideways for the rest of your life, because I will have used all your up-and-down. Now, is that what you want?
1152	Turk	No.
1153	Carla	Good. Because what I want is for this to be a real relationship. I want us to know each other better than we know ourselves.
1154	Turk	Wow.
1155	Carla	That's right "wow."So if you really want me 'daily and nightly and ever so rightly'...
1156	Elliot	That sounds like something you'd say.
1157	Carla	...Show me that you know me.
1158	J.D.	So, anyway, I think you should let the kid meet the ladies.

1160	Dr. Cox	So, you're the one who told Kelso that Mr. Martinez was dead? That's terrific work.
1161	J.D.'s Thoughts	Looks like word gets around.
1162	Dr. Cox	What in the name of 'Are ya there, God, it's me Margaret' were you thinking.
1163	J.D.	Well, I'm new here, but I'm relatively certain that invasive vascular procedures have a very low success rate on dead people.
1164	Dr. Cox	That TIPS procedure was for Mrs. Blitt down in 103. You see, she doesn't have insurance; Mr. Martinez, on the other hand, had great insurance. Should I talk slower or go get a nurse who speaks fluent moron?
1165	J.D.	You don't have to be, like, mean about it.
1166	Dr. Cox	Well, geez, newbie, just what in the hell do you want from me, huh?I don't know if they taught you this in the land of fairies and puppy-dog tails, where you obviously, if not grew up then at least spent most of your summers, but you're in the real world now. Nnnnn-kay?
1167	J.D.'s Thoughts	Don't say it!
1168	J.D.	I still think I was right.
1169	J.D.'s Thoughts	Once every 6.3 seconds, a man says something stupid that another man hears and punishes him for...Luckily, this wasn't
1170	Dr. Cox	That's it!
1171	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, no.
1172	Dr. Cox	Do you know what this is? This is me washing my hands of you. I will not be in the same room with you again, starting........Now.

1174	Cut To	Jared's Room

1184	J.D.	Oh, no, this this is my roommate's badge, sir; we must have switched this morning. We were b
1185	Dr. Kelso	Oh, that's a great anecdote. You should write that down in your journal, then your kids can read about it when you're dead.
1186	Dr. Steadman	Sir, they're waiting for us
1187	Dr. Kelso	In a moment. If you will promise to go easy on the stories, I'd love for you to join me for a round of golf tomorrow.
1188	J.D.	That'd be terrific, sir!
1189	Dr. Kelso	Super.

1191	Turk	You wanna show a woman you know her, you gotta buy her a little somethin'-somethin'.
1192	Elliot	This doesn't make any sense, none of my patients are improving.
1193	Turk	I'm gonna buy her flowers.
1194	Todd	Yeah!!!!
1195	Elliot	Please, it's been done to death.I don't get it; I've done everything by the book.
1196	J.D.	Well, maybe that's the problem, maybe you're just approaching things too clinically.
1197	Turk	How 'bout chocolates?
1198	Elliot	Mmm! With rich, cliché centers?
1199	J.D.	Have you ever tried treating your patients with something other than traditional medicine?
1200	Turk	I got it! I'm gonna buy her a really nice...pen.No...she loves to write. She hand-writes all of her letters because she says e-mail is too impersonal. That's perfect!
1201	Elliot	Pen is good.
1202	Todd	Yeah-ah!
1203	Turk	Now all I gotta do is find time to get outta here and maybe I'll buy her one.
1204	J.D.	Look, all I'm saying is, there's more to healing than what's in the books. I talk to my patients, I I sing to them......Ask them what their hobbies are; and tell them ghost stories about an old sea captain.
1205	Nurse Roberts	Thought you'd be interested in that kid Jared's chart.
1206	Elliot	Wow! Look at that white blood cell count!
1207	J.D.	Look at that. And all it took was a visit from The Rock.
1208	Todd	The Rock was here and nobody told me?!

1217	Dr. Cox	Who's the present from?
1218	Carla	Oh, my boyfriend.
1219	Dr. Cox	Really, when did he give it to you?
1220	J.D.'s Thoughts	Look at him, pretending like yesterday never happened. Well, if he thinks I'm gonna forgive him without so much as a
1221	Dr. Cox	Anyway, newbie, the reason I was all bent outta shape yesterday
1222	J.D.	I accept!
1223	Dr. Cox	Don't interrupt me. Come here;Pull that curtain. Mrs. Blitt over there needs the TIPS procedure, no insurance? Yeah, well, she can now look forward to a lifetime of encephalopathy and jaundice thanks to Bottom-Line Bob.
1224	J.D.	Is it really that bad?
1225	Dr. Cox	I...hate...Robert Kelso. I hate his family, I hate his friends, I hate the guy that cleans his vaguely racist little lawn jockey; in fact, I hate anybody who ever even associates with him. Is that clear?

1239	Nurse Roberts	The doctors in the ER have a box where they actually keep all this junk.
1240	Turk	Is that, like, next to the lost-&-found box?
1241	Nurse Roberts	Lost-&-found box? There's no lost-&-found box. There's an ass box.
1242	Elliot	Oh, no, that's not Carla's pen?
1243	Turk	I had no time to shop!!!Ohhh! Ohhhh!!!
1244	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
1245	Dr. Kelso	Beautiful day for golf, eh sports?
1246	Dr. Steadman	Yes, sir, Dr. Kelso!Look, I don't know what you're trying to pull, but I am not a guy you want to mess with.
1247	Dr. Kelso	Steadman... I need a tee.
1248	Dr. Steadman	A tee or some tea, sir? because I brought both.
1249	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, relax, it's just a friendly game of golf with a couple of guys from work.
1250	Dr. Kelso	Excellent, our fourth has arrived.
1251	Dr. Cox	'Sup, newbie.
1252	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
1253	J.D.'s Thoughts	You know what? He's got nothing to say; after all, he's here, too.
1254	J.D.	Thought you hated Kelso.
1255	Dr. Cox	Oh, I do. And watching his face as I kick his worthless butt up and down this golf course every week is basically..., well, it's the most fun I can have without being forced to cuddle afterwards.
1256	Dr. Steadman	Oh, goodnight, Irene! Fantastic golf shot, sir!
1257	Dr. Cox	Real nice length. Now, does your husband happen to play?
1258	Dr. Kelso	Ha...ha.
1259	Dr. Cox	For the record, no, I'm not a hypocrite for being here. What's your pathetic excuse, you whiny, little suck-up.
1260	J.D.'s Thoughts	Ignore him. Just let your game do all the talking.
1261	Dr. Cox	That'll play.
1262	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
1263	Cut To	The Hall
1264	Turk	Don't open it! Please don't open it. Oh, please don't open it!
1265	Cut To	A Room in the Unit
1266	Elliot	You know, since we've been chatting, maybe...you could raise your heart rate for me? What do you say?What am I doing? This is stupid.
1267	Turk	Please, please don't make her open it.Are you that busy?
1268	Carla	You do know me.
1269	Turk	I just...
1270	Carla	Sweetie, I love this!
1271	Turk	Oh... Ohh...! God It's so it's so cool.
1272	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
1273	Dr. Steadman	I'm woozy.
1274	Dr. Kelso	You're fine.Today's the day I finally beat his uppity, insubordinate Eh! Great shot, doctor! You see, son, I always say, "Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer." You believe him? You're away and yet he hit first.
1275	J.D.	It's just a technicality.
1276	Dr. Kelso	Ah. But there's the rub. The rules are there for a reason; you break one, why not break them all?
1277	Cut To	Another Hole
1278	Dr. Cox	You know that before medicine ever became a business, the only rule was to do your best to help the patient.
1279	Cut To	The Sandtrap
1280	Dr. Kelso	Like it or not, medicine is a business. If the hospital shuts down, who are we helping then?
1281	Cut to	The Restrooms
1282	Dr. Cox	So, what, only people with money deserve medical treatment?
1283	Cut To	The Rough
1284	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
1285	J.D.	Dammit!
1286	Dr. Kelso	It's about what's best for the hospital.
1287	J.D.	Argh!ARGH!
1288	Cut To	The Water
1289	Dr. Cox	It's about what's best for the patient.
1290	Cut to	The 18th Green.
1291	Dr. Kelso	The only reason I go back to that hospital day after day is because I care about those patients every one of 'em. You've got a lot of potential, sport; you stick with me, and you're going to be climbing the ladder very quickly. Isn't that what you want?You have to sink this for the win, Cox.
1292	Dr. Cox	Hey, newbie, c'mere I almost forgot. I'm gonna get Mrs. Blitt her TIPS procedure tomorrow, with or without insurance; and I want you to help me. Now, tell me, Margaret, do you have the stones to sink a putt when you have to?See you next Wednesday.I love this game!
1293	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
1294	J.D.	I can't decide if I should help Cox or not. It's driving me crazy.
1295	Turk	Dude, at least you didn't give your girlfriend a gift that used to be inside of someone.
1296	J.D.	That's true.
1297	Elliot	I have magic breasts.
1298	J.D.	How many has she had?
1299	Turk	Almost one. You know what, Cox doesn't need your help taking her down for a TIPS procedure. As a matter of fact, he shouldn't even be putting you in that situation!
1300	J.D.	You're right.
1301	Turk	Hell, yeah, I'm right! Screw Cox! ....I mean, you're not afraid of him, are you?
1302	J.D.	Hell no!
1303	Cut To	The Hospital Hallway
1304	J.D.'s Thoughts	....Okay, maybe a little.
1305	Janitor	That's four.
1306	J.D.	That's three!
1307	Janitor	That's five.
1308	Cut To	A Unit in the ICU.
1309	Dr. Cox	Still nothing. All righty, we're through here. Somebody call it.
1310	Elliot	Wait!
1311	Dr. Cox	Right. Time of death , 6:20.
1312	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
1313	Carla	Hey... There's my buppie.
1314	Turk	Did you just say "buppie"? Uh, 'cause that's not gonna work for me. Carla, we gotta talk.
1315	Carla	We can talk later.
1316	Turk	Later's good.
1317	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
1318	Dr. Kelso	Let's just worry about getting you better, okay gorgeous?
1319	J.D.'s Narration	I'd decided that Cox was wrong. There's room to play by the rules and care about the patients.
1320	Dr. Kelso	I want you to do a wallet biopsy on her, and if the insurance doesn't check out, I want her back to the nursing home before she so much as gums down a single fruit cup.
1321	Dr. Steadman	Mm-hmm.
1322	J.D.'s Narration	Unfortunately, that was the moment I realized how Dr. Kelso truly saw these people.
1323	Dr. Kelso	Can I have a price-check on a seventy-four-year-old female with pre-renal azotemia?Bag her!
1324	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
1325	Carla	I wanna show you something.
1326	Turk	Wait; it's about the pen.So...I thought a really nice one would be a great gift; and I see a great one...in the "lost-&-found" box.
1327	Carla	There is no "lost-&-found" box. There's an ass box.
1328	Turk	Yeah.... There is.
1329	Carla	Ugh.... And to think, you were this close to getting everything you wanted! I assume this is what you want.
1330	Turk	Yes.
1331	Carla	And yet you come home and tell me that your thoughtful token of love wasn't a token of love at all... it was an ass pen. You come home and tell me this all because being open and honest in our relationship is more important to you than....having sex with me.Are you coming, or what?
1332	Turk	Hell, yeah.Stay, Rowdy, stay.
1333	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
1334	J.D.	It took me, like, three hours to realize who
1335	Group	That's her! That's her!
1336	Old Man	Excuse me, miss.
1337	Elliot	Can I help you?
1338	Old Man	Well, I'm afraid I have just an awful case of the 'gotta see 'ems.'
1339	J.D.	You know that's not even a real disease?
1340	Elliot	At what point did I become a crazy person?
1341	J.D.	Oh, come on. Yes, exposing yourself to a dead guy might have been a tad unorthodox; and yes, it might be a little hard to live down....
1342	Elliot	I'm waiting for the "but."
1343	J.D.	So is everyone else around here.Oh, that's not funny.
1344	Elliot	Thanks. Glad I shared.
1345	J.D.	Come on. When I look at you, I look at a doctor who'll do whatever it takes to help a patient.
1346	Elliot	Really?
1347	J.D.	Yeah, really.
1348	J.D.'s Narration	And...on that note....
1349	Cut to	The Admissions Area
1350	J.D.	I just want you to know, if you still want my help, I'm on board.
1351	Dr. Cox	What, are you kidding? It's way too big of a risk for a peon. Okay I just wanted to see what team you were playing for.
1352	J.D.'s Thoughts	So it was all a test.
1353	Dr. Cox	Besides, I already did it.
1354	Dr. Kelso	Cox!!!!
1355	Dr. Cox	Run, junior daddy's home!
1356	Dr. Kelso	Did you actually think I wouldn't find out what you did!?
1357	Dr. Cox	What did I do?
1358	Dr. Kelso	You insolent....
1359	Dr. Cox	I'm insolent?
1360	Dr. Kelso	....Arrogant....
1361	Dr. Cox	I I'm arrogant?
1362	J.D.'s Narration	I know it sounds melodramatic, but in my mind, as I watched the two of them, they weren't battling for patients or insurance... they were battling for my soul.
1363	Dr. Cox	...Bottom line, she needs the TIPS procedure, with insurance or without insurance...
1364	Dr. Kelso	I've got you this time, Cox. I can taste it!
1365	J.D.'s Narration	It's an old story, really good versus bad, right versus wrong... the Dark Side versus The Light...
1366	Dr. Kelso	I've been waiting for this moment all my life.
1367	Turk	Easy, Chewy.
1368	Dr. Kelso	I'll teach you to respect this institution.
1369	Dr. Cox	I hope you learn from this.
1370	J.D.	NO!!!
1371	Dr. Kelso	You're suspended! Effective immediately.Well, sport, it looks like a permanent spot just opened up on the golf course. How does joining the Chief of Medicine for a weekly round sound?
1372	J.D.	Actually, sir, I'm not really that in to golf.
1373	Dr. Kelso	Well, I guess that's your choice, isn't it... Dr. Dorian.
1374	J.D.'s Thoughts	I think I liked it better when he didn't know my name.
1375	Janitor	That's one for me.
1376	J.D.	Owww.
1377	Janitor	That's two.
1378	J.D.	I'm hurt.
1379	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
1380	JD	Say "ah".
1381	Patient	Ah.
1382	JD	Say "oh".
1383	Patient	Ohh?
1384	JD	Everybody say ahh-ohh, ahh-ohh!........Ohh...... Excuse me.
1385	Lawyer	As legal counselor, it is my job to inform you that your suspension is effective immediately.Oh, gah! I'm just the messenger! Your long-term job status will be decided at the board meeting. Until then, and I can not bend on this, I don't want you setting foot on the premises.
1386	Dr. Cox	I'm going to be here all day.
1387	Lawyer	That works for me; that'll be good. I hope that works out....
1388	JD	Dr. Cox, if you need to talk
1389	J.D.'s Narration	It was weird knowing that my mentor could be fired by this time tomorrow. But there's no reason to feel any less confident; I'll be fine without a safety net.
1390	Patient	So, what do you think, Dr. Dorian? Bypass or stant?
1391	JD	Bypass!Or stant.
1392	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
1393	J.D.'s Narration	There's a lot of horrible things about being an intern: long hours, constant stress, having to deal with death. But worst of all is the simple fact that the average intern has to disimpact fifteen to twenty bowels a week.
1394	JD	That's why there's a sacred oath among interns never to make fun of each other for doing the things we have to do.
1395	Elliot	Hee-hee. You have to touch someone's hiney!
1396	Dr. Kelso	Dorian, come with me. And Dr... uh...
1397	Elliot	Reid.
1398	Dr. Kelso	Sure, why not. Take over for him.
1399	JD	Hee-hee!
1400	Dr. Kelso	I'm assigning you to a very important board member whose family built this hospital with their bare hands.
1401	J.D.'s Thoughts	That can't be true. I hate that expression.
1402	Dr. Kelso	But for hypertrophic cardio-myopathy.
1403	J.D.	What happened?
1404	Dr. Kelso	Pre-syncope.
1405	J.D.	So this board member almost fainted? I'll fire up the paddles.
1406	Dr. Kelso	Ah! Dr. Wisenheimer's back; how was your ski trip?
1407	J.D.	Sir, I'm confused.
1408	Dr. Kelso	You annoy me.
1409	J.D.	Oh, now I get it.
1410	Dr. Kelso	But you have this nauseating charm everyone else around here seems to respond to. Use it, okay, sport?
1411	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, great, an eighty-year-old, grouchy, pretentious

1413	J.D.'s Thoughts	....Smokin', hot biddy!....Who do you love the most....
1414	Dr. Kelso	Ah, Sweetheart! Are you getting younger?

1416	Dr. Kelso	This is Dr. Dorian he'll be looking after you.
1417	Jordan	And who will be looking after him?Ighck.
1418	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
1419	Elliot	Since your jaw is wired shut, we're going to give you IV nutrition for a couple days, okay?Oh, sorry, you can't answer! It's like going to the dentist; I hate when they ask you questions, and you have all that stuff in your mouth, don't you?Oh, my God, I did it again! Dr. Greenberg. "Dr."? What kind of doctor are you? I keep doing it! Okay, okay, um... just just act it out.Head?Shrinking. Shrin You're a shrink!Wow! I can't imagine picking psychiatry as a specialty after interning as a real doctor.That didn't come out right... It's just, my dad um, he's a doctor, too he says therapy is for people with more money than problems.But then... my dad says a lot of things....
1420	Nurse	Did anyone page a nurse?
1421	Elliot	No.
1422	Nurse	It looks like his eyes are screaming.
1423	Elliot	Please, we're talking?Where was I?
1424	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
1425	Carla	You should get dressed.
1426	Turk	I can't, it's still out there.
1427	Carla	Don't call my mother "it"; it implies you think that she's a monster! Now get a move on it usually gets up to feed about now.
1428	Turk	Baby, I don't understand why we couldn't stay at my place. I mean, I coulda done a whole show for you.
1429	Carla	Ohhh! There's a show.
1430	Turk	Yeah, there's a show. It involves music, some dancing, occasionally singing.
1431	Carla	Can you do "Me and Mrs. Jones"?
1432	Turk	I dunno.... What does she look like?
1433	Carla	Look, you wanted to spend the whole night together, and I can't leave my mother alone, she's frail.
1434	Turk	Baby, tell her to put the cane down.
1435	Carla	Mama!
1436	Carla's Mama	No!
1437	Turk	Tell her to put the cane down!
1438	Carla	She doesn't want me to have men here because I'm unmarried.
1439	Turk	Well tell her I needed a place to crash; she doesn't have to know we had sex all night.
1440	Carla	She speaks English!
1441	Turk	Then what the hell are you translating for?
1442	Carla	Because you don't speak Spanish!
1443	Turk	Oh! Hola!
1444	Carla's Mama	No! NO!

1446	Turk	Tell her to put the CANE DOWN!

1448	J.D.	I have to be honest, Miss Sullivan; when Dr. Kelso said "board member", I was thinking of this, like, old, grumpy
1449	Jordan	That would be my father. He died.
1450	J.D.	I'm so sorry.
1451	Jordan	...Twenty years ago.
1452	J.D.	Oh. I woulda said sorry back then, but I had a little trouble with my S's....I was five.... S's.... So... uh... how are you feeling?
1453	Jordan	Great. That's why I'm here. Listen, R.J.
1454	J.D.	J.D.
1455	Jordan	Like it matters. Look, you seem like a nice, spineless little boy, so let's be honest. I'm here because it was the only way to end my beast of a mother's nagging, pseudo-concern.
1456	J.D.	How sweet.
1457	Jordan	So, do your little tests; but first, close the blinds, wash off whatever eighth-grade dance cologne you're wearing so we don't add nausea to my symptoms, and I'll need lemon wedges for my sparkling water which, for some reason, you have yet to get me.
1458	J.D.	Okay, well let me just check out
1459	Jordan	Doing things I want first, your little tests later.
1460	J.D.	Nice to meet you.
1461	J.D.'s Thoughts	I hate you.

1463	Elliot	Merry Christmas, Dr. Greenberg!I mean, uh, happy Halloween. Ugh! I am so frazzled; I did not sleep at all. In fact, I haven't really slept since I started here.Just so much pressure, you know? I can't talk to anyone here 'cause it's so competitive. I used to be able to talk to my mom, but now, well... she listens but... she just never really seems to hear me, you know?
1464	It reads	"How does that make you feel?"
1465	Elliot	Lonely, depressed, overwhelmed. And sometimes I have no idea how I'm possibly gonna be able to make it through this.
1466	It reads	"PAIN PILL"

1469	Dr. Kelso	Ah, Dr. Cox, I've been thinking about your predicament, and I think I have a solution.Cruise ships!
1470	Dr. Cox	Right.
1471	Dr. Kelso	Think about it, everyone will call you "Doc", you'll visit exotic ports, heck, maybe you'll even get to meet Charo!
1472	Dr. Cox	Listen, you should go ahead and enjoy this while you can, Bobby. Because if your evil genie actually does grant your wish, and I disappear, the only person you'll have left to contend with around here will be yourself. And when you really get to know that person oh, dear God you'll scream so loud that Satan will want to rip up the contract you signed at birth, just so he can get some sleep.
1473	Dr. Kelso	Look at you with your stiff upper lip. I think I'm going to miss that the most.
1474	Dr. Cox	What are you looking at?
1475	J.D.	Oh, no, I just... I-I like your shirt. Wh-what-what kind of shirt is that?
1476	Dr. Cox	It's a white t-shirt.

1479	Turk	I will never sleep at your place again.
1480	Carla	It wasn't that bad!

1482	Turk	Does your mother invite the priest over for breakfast every day?
1483	Carla	Only when she finds me in bed with some guy.... So, yeah, most days.
1484	Turk	That's not funny, okay? That's not funny.
1485	Elliot	I'm just in a much better place, you know? Do I look different?
1486	J.D.	"What kind of shirt is that." I am-I am such an idiot!
1487	Elliot	I'm in a better place!
1488	Turk	What do you say? My apartment, tonight?
1489	Carla	I'll think about it.
1490	Elliot	Why doesn't anyone ever listen to me?
1491	Turk	'In a better place', 'look different', 'feel good', 'kay? That's what usually happens when you see a shrink.
1492	Elliot	My patient happens to be a therapist, I'm not 'seeing a shrink.'
1493	Turk	Okay.
1494	Elliot	And I would appreciate it if you'd stop spreading around embarrassing rumors like that.

1500	Jordan	It's okay, come on in.I meant, come in the room, not in here. What's the matter with you? Are you even a real doctor?
1501	J.D.	Look, I know that you're on the Board, and I have this friend well, he's not really a friend, he's more like a mentor....

1547	Dr. Cox	Don't look her in the eyes, newbie; she'll steal your soul. So, how are things going down in the underworld?
1548	Jordan	Good. And you? Still have a rollicking social life?

1552	Jordan	Ooh. That must have hurt.
1553	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh my God. I gotta get out of here. Anger like this has a way of being passed on to whoever's closest.
1554	Carla	Dr. Cox, I know you're suspended, but you're the only one that my mother trusts.
1555	Dr. Cox	Not. Now!
1556	Carla	This is all your fault!
1557	Elliot	Hey hey, Turk, can I talk to y
1558	Turk	No, you can't; that's why they're called your problems!
1559	Elliot	Sorry!
1560	Janitor	Happy Halloween.
1561	J.D.	Ugh!
1562	Janitor	Maybe that'll teach you not to spy on people during their alone time!
1563	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, when dealing with a crisis, everyone knows that you go right to the source.God, the source is pretty.
1564	J.D.	Miss Sullivan? Excuse me, Miss Sullivan.
1565	Jordan	Honey, I think we're way past "Miss Sullivan".
1566	J.D.	Okay... 'Jordan'Uh... I just don't think we should see each other again.
1567	Jordan	The story of my life. Anytime I let my guard down just a little, I get hurt.
1568	J.D.	I am so sorry.
1569	Jordan	You know how long it's been since I connected with someone? You know, it's not fair that just because of him I don't get to spend time Boy, it's hard to keep that going! See ya, D.J., I got a date...."See each other again"...
1570	J.D.	She's gonna be okay.

1572	Elliot	I don't know, mom. I'm just feeling lost, you know? Everyone here is so busy, and... I guess I'm just kind of lonely. ... ... M-mom, could you could you just try to hear what I'm saying? Just this once? ... ... No, I don't have short hair. ... Yes, I know, short hair gives me pig face. ... Yeah. Mm-hmm.

1574	J.D.	Dr. Cox!
1575	Dr. Cox	Okay, Linus, you're way too excited; I want you to get your blankie, go in a corner, and take a time-out. Non-displaced femoral fracture... Carla's mom's gonna be fine.Okay, what?
1576	J.D.	Your ex-wife. She's the answer.
1577	Dr. Cox	Uhhh.... Things that ruined my life. Things that took half my money. Things with sharp edges!
1578	J.D.	Come on, she's on the board! Deep down, I'm sure she's a reasonable person.... Not that I know her that well, or at all, or have ever been alone with her.... But I'm sure if you just
1579	Dr. Cox	No!
1580	J.D.	...Ask?
1581	Dr. Cox	I'm gonna go ahead and do this just as slowly as possible so you don't misunderstand: Nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnooooooooooooooooooooooo.
1582	J.D.'s Thoughts	I wonder if he wants me to ask her?
1583	J.D.	Fine. I'll ask her.
1584	J.D.'s Thoughts	That's a "no".
1585	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
1586	Dr. Cox	That's always funny!
1587	Carla	I can't believe she's sleeping.
1588	Dr. Cox	I had the intern give her two Valium.
1589	Carla	Why, was she in a lot of pain?
1590	Dr. Cox	No; she just wouldn't shut up.
1591	Carla	I'm sorry!
1592	Dr. Cox	Listen, I notice your little boyfriend's name's not on the cast.
1593	Carla	Are you kidding? Making me leave her alone like that?
1594	Dr. Cox	Do you understand that she would have gotten hurt whether you were there or not?
1595	Carla	Nuh-uh.
1596	Dr. Cox	She fell in the shower. So, unless you two have an extremely disturbing relationship, I'm afraid you're full of crap.
1597	Carla	I'm full of crap!? If you don't care about being suspended, why are you here?You may scare everybody else with those crazy eyes, but you don't scare me.
1598	Dr. Cox	You use your mom as an excuse to not take chances.
1599	Carla	You're never happy unless you're here.
1600	Dr. Cox	Admit you're afraid to live your own life!
1601	Carla	Admit that losing this place would kill you!
1602	Dr. Cox	We done?
1603	Carla	It's all I got.
1604	Dr. Cox	Crazy eyes?Low blow!
1605	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
1606	J.D.'s Thoughts	There are other ways to save Dr. Cox's job.I could try talking to Dr. Kelso.Dr. Cox could get extensive plastic surgery to look like Jimmie Walker.
1607	"Dr. Cox"	This guy's gonna need 30 MAQs of KCL.
1608	J.D.'s Thoughts	Or, I could just ask Jimmie Walker to talk to Dr. Kelso.
1609	Jimmie Walker	Your man Cox is the best. I know he's got an unorthodox way of doing things, but all the innovators do!Now, everybody deserves a second chance; am I right?
1610	Dr. Kelso	Who are you?
1611	J.D.'s Thoughts	Or I could get back to the problem at hand.
1612	J.D.	Jordan!Look, I know you're on your way to the board meeting, and I know you don't really like me, but
1613	Jordan	I don't dislike you I nothing you.
1614	J.D.	Oh, thanks, that's that's special. Look, I have to ask you a favor, but you have to know this is not why we slept together.
1615	Jordan	Yeah, you had nothing to do with why we slept together.
1616	J.D.	I think we both know that's not completely true.
1617	Jordan	Oh, please. Even though you're terrified the Good Dr. Cox'll find out, if I wanted you to go to his apartment right now and have sex with me in front of him, you would.
1618	J.D.	Please don't do that.
1619	Jordan	You know, you remind me of him when he was younger.
1620	J.D.	Then, Jordan, look into your heart and see if you can dig up some sympathy for someone who means a whole lot to me; and probably means a little to you, too.So will you help him?
1621	Jordan	Oh, sweetie.... No.
1622	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
1623	Turk	You know, I went to therapy once.
1624	Elliot	You did?
1625	Turk	Yeah. Once, though, like, back in '93 to '94; and then three months in '95; and then I went to Group which was a disaster. Okay, when I went away to college, it was my first time away from home. And so, things started piling up, and I felt like I was sinking, you know?
1626	Elliot	Yeah, I do.
1627	Turk	No matter how embarrassing you think it might be, it's always helpful to talk to someone neutral. For example, take a look at me: I am now thanks to therapy in a healthy relationship with a beautiful woman who won't sleep over at my house because she thinks I broke her mother's leg.Hey! Baby!How long you been back there for? Y-y-you were there for a second, huh? Because, you know, I wasn't talking about us, I was
1628	Carla	Turk. My mother's spending the night here, so I will be spending the night with you; only we have to leave right now.

1631	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes, no matter how badly you want to keep something from happening, there's nothing you can do to stop it. And, right now, the board of directors of Sacred Heart is behind that door, sipping bubbly water and killing the career of Dr. Cox.
1632	Dr. Cox	YES! I am bullet-proof!
1633	J.D.'s Thoughts	He's taking it well.
1634	Lawyer	So, uh, no hard feelings, right, amigo?
1635	Dr. Cox	Careful....
1636	Lawyer	Catch you on the flip-side!
1637	Dr. Kelso	I really think you're making a big mistake.You see, the most destructive thing about Dr.
1638	Jordan	Yawn! You see, I saw "yawn," because when I actually yawn, you don't get it.
1639	Dr. Kelso	See you in hell.
1640	J.D.'s Narration	I don't know why she did it; maybe I got to her, maybe she knows how much the hospital needs him, maybe, somewhere, she remembers why she cared about him in the first place.
1641	Jordan	I did it 'cause the thought of you rotting here in this fluorescent tomb is more fun than tipping the valet with your alimony check.
1642	Dr. Cox	Oh, listen here, pumpkin, if you're honestly having this much trouble getting over me, just go ahead and give me a call and I'll toss you a sympathy throw-down anytime.
1643	J.D.'s Narration	Whatever the reason, it made me realize that every ending leads to new complications.......New problems to be dealt with.
1644	Carla	I'm watching that.
1645	J.D.'s Narration	...New issues.
1646	Elliot	Thanks, Dr. Greenberg.See you next week.

1648	Cut to	Interior - The Doctors' Lounge
1649	Dr. Cox	She was never boring.
1650	J.D.	What happened?
1651	Dr. Cox	Eh, you marry somebody just like your mother, and then you remember you hate your mother.You asked her for help, didn't you.
1652	J.D.	Look, I don't think you realize how important you are to some people around here.
1653	J.D.'s Narration	I'll always remember that moment as the first "thank you" I got from Dr. Cox.
1654	Dr. Cox	Well, geez, Agnes, does the field hockey team know that you're missing?
1655	J.D.'s Narration	It felt good.
1656	Dr. Cox	Although, it did take some stones to be honest.
1657	J.D.	Stick with the truth, and you can't get hurt; it's just always been my philosophy.
1658	Dr. Cox	You didn't sleep with her, did you?
1659	J.D.	God, no!
1660	J.D.'s Narration	Philosophy is tricky.
1661	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
1662	Dr. Kelso	Let's start off with a toughy. Who can tell me...
1663	J.D.'s Narration	Over the last few weeks, the most amazing thing has happened I've been nailing rounds. I think I'm actually starting to separate myself from the pack.
1664	J.D.	Sir, I'd say it's Beck's Triad.
1665	J.D.'s Narration	...It keeps me on top of my game...
1666	J.D.	Looks like a break in the ulna, right there.
1667	J.D.'s Narration	It's good to be the king.
1668	J.D.	You know, it's it's okay to be impressed by me most girls are.
1669	J.D.'s Narration	The only problem with reaching the top is that sooner or later someone starts nipping at your heels....For me, that guy was Nick Murdoch.
1670	Elliot	Wow.
1671	J.D.	Well, the gurney adds drama.
1672	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
1673	J.D.'s Thoughts	So that's the guy who wants to take me down.
1674	Nick	Of course you're gonna have a scar, Peter. I mean...you're not getting any surgery, but chicks dig scars, so I think I'm gonna give you one anyway.
1675	Nurse Roberts	Doctor.... Peter's drug rash is getting a lot worse.
1676	Nick	No problem. Just give him Prednisone and Benadryl. I'll go...
1677	J.D.'s Thoughts	Good bed-side manner, good rapport with the nurses...
1678	J.D.'s Narration	...sees me staring at him....
1679	Nick	...for a dermatology consult.
1680	J.D.'s Thoughts	Act busy!
1681	J.D.	That's the...that's the stud, right there. That's where you'd...hang a painting.
1682	Nick	He was born John Dorian, but he was simply known as 'J.D.' Doctor. Friend. Lover.Hey, man, how are ya?
1683	J.D.	Hey, how are you?Oh, okay. There there that is.
1684	Nick	Gosh, can you believe we're doctors? The other night, I'm at a restaurant and this guy starts choking. They asked if anyone was a doctor, I didn't even move!
1685	J.D.	Yeah, I know. I still feel like I'm seven years old, playing 'MASH' with my older brother.
1686	Little J.D.	I don't wanna be HotLips again!
1687	J.D.'s Brother	Shut up, and kiss Frank.
1688	J.D.	I don't talk to my brother much.
1689	J.D.'s Thoughts	What are you doing? Don't connect with him.
1690	J.D.	Well, I'll see ya.
1691	Nick	Okay.
1692	J.D.	Wait. Whatever happened to the guy in the restaurant?
1693	Nick	Oh, eventually I remembered I was a doctor; 'course, he'd been dead for twenty minutes very embarrassing. Food was good, though.

1714	J.D.	You slut.
1715	Elliot	Yeah.
1716	J.D.	How about Nick?
1717	Elliot	Oh... I'd let him drool on me. Oh, that's gross, why did I say that? I I shouldn't talk to people. Besides, I wouldn't know what to do even if I was interested.
1718	J.D.	Well, you could start by looking at him.
1719	Elliot	Did he look back, did he like me? Why doesn't he like me? I can't believe I already blew it.
1720	J.D.'s Narration	It felt weird trying to push Nick on her. I mean, this morning I wanted to kill the guy; but the truth is, he's so nice, he probably would've helped me.
1721	Nick	Come on, J.D., you're not closing the windpipe you gotta put more pressure down here. Come on, I know you can do it! Come on! Come on!
1722	Dr. Kelso	Ahh, if it isn't the brain trust. Someone tell me what this patient's rash is. You have until I finish my squeezy-juice.

1724	Nick	It's Erythema Migrans.
1725	J.D.	Then why don't you just answer it?
1726	Nick	Everyone looks up to you. It's important to them that you don't get stumped. Besides, come on, it's important to you, too.
1727	J.D.'s Thoughts	Please. Like he knows me.
1728	J.D.	It's, uh, Erythema Migrans, sir!

1800	Dr. Kelso	Good afternoon, doctors. I've gathered you all here because, well, attendance at my new conferences has been very disappointing. In fact, I've begun to wonder if maybe you have something more important to do. Maybe you feel the need to sneak off and have a little nappy-nap. I love nappy-naps. Or...maybe you've forgotten that my conferences are mandatory! My hospital, my rules!
1801	J.D.	Actually, sir, I've never missed one. I just wanted to... Battin' a thousand over here!

1821	Carla	Why can't you just, for once, dig deep down into your heart, access some emotions, and empathize with me.
1822	Dr. Cox	I'm sorry, uh, what were we doing?
1823	Carla	See? That's why no one likes you.

1828	Dr. Kelso	You see, Dr. Dorian, your problem is...you're a pansy. If you were in my way, I'd throw you off this ledge right now. We're out here alone.... No one would ever know.

1855	Dr. Cox	I'll be more than glad to tell you what a lot of doctors do to relieve the stress: Just take a little trip to "Palmdale."
1856	Turk	What?
1857	Dr. Cox	Okay give yourself the old "low-five."
1858	Turk	I'm not getting it.
1859	Dr. Cox	Physician, love thyself.
1860	Turk	Are you talkin' about down-town, Lester Brown?
1861	Dr. Cox	Lowers the heart-rate, releases the endorphins, it's basic physiology.
1862	Turk	Okay, you almost had me.You're not serious.
1863	Dr. Cox	Yes, I am.
1864	Turk	No, you're not.
1865	Dr. Cox	Yes.
1866	Turk	No.Huh. Okay.
1867	Dr. Cox	Nobody hurts Carla and gets way with it.
1868	Doug	Who's Carla?
1869	Dr. Cox	I was talkin' to myself; don't eavesdrop.This kid doesn't leave, I'm gonna kill him.Now, if you leave, I'll know you were eavesdropping I'll just go ahead and kill you, anyway.Stay. Good girl.

1871	Janitor	Tick-tock, Clarice.
1872	J.D.'s Narration	Dr. Kelso's talk helped me figure out what I had to do.
1873	Nick	Hey, good timing. Gimme a hand with this foley cath., will ya?
1874	J.D.	Oh, you got it.
1875	J.D.'s Narration	Whether or not Nick knew how petty and jealous and competitive I'd been, I still felt like I needed to step up, lay it out there, and apologize like a man.
1876	J.D.	We cool?
1877	Nick	Yeah.
1878	J.D.'s Narration	Besides, even if I was the star for a little while, he's the man now.
1879	J.D.	This belongs to you.
1880	Nick	Oh, thanks a lot, man.Can you grab me some more tape?
1881	J.D.	Oh, sure.
1882	J.D.'s Narration	Once you line up behind a truly strong leader, everyone picks up their game.
1883	Nick	We need to get the results of this urine sample.
1884	J.D.'s Narration	We began to function like a well-oiled machine.
1885	J.D.	Hey, Nick, I got the results back from the, uh.... Nick?
1886	Nurse Roberts	His blood cultures don't look good at all.
1887	Nick	No problem.

1889	Dr. Cox	Listen, I was thinking about what happened earlier, and.... Anyway...uh, here.
1890	Carla	Wow. You finally dug deep down in your heart and came up with a muffin!
1891	Dr. Cox	That's store-bought, sister. There's blueberries in there the size of your fist.
1892	Carla	I shouldn't have dragged you into it, anyway. You don't even know Turk.
1893	Dr. Cox	Actually, I met him today. We had a terrific chat.Oh, give the man a hand. That's just terrific work. You know darn well that felt good. And you're feeling better about yourself, now, aren'cha?Real nice guy.
1894	Carla	It's hard letting yourself be vulnerable with someone, you know?
1895	Dr. Cox	Oh, just eat the damn muffin, would ya, please?

1897	Elliot	You know what? Even though I'm on-call tonight, I'm not gonna let the bad stuff in anymore. I'm not gonna let myself get overwhelmed.What?
1898	J.D.	Well, it's just that, Friday night, when you had people over, you locked yourself in your room because we brought the wrong chips.
1899	Elliot	Look at me. That was the old Elliot.
1900	Nurse Roberts	Hey, can you help me find Dr. Murdoch? Peter's parents are here and he's not answering his page.
1901	J.D.	Sure. You know, Elliot's not gonna let herself be overwhelmed anymore.She's been drinking!
1902	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
1903	Dr. Cox	Carla? Wow. You look great.
1904	Carla	You're not messing with me, right?
1905	Dr. Cox	No. But I'd like to.
1906	Carla	Turk bought me this dress, out of the blue. I guess he knew I'd love it.
1907	Dr. Cox	Oh. Look, Carla. Back when I was an intern, I remember the pressure being so insane that the only way I could get by was to race home and, even though my wife was already asleep, I'd gently wake her, look her in the eyes, and then I'd passive-aggressively torture her until she packed a bag and went to her mom's place for the week.
1908	Carla	Oh...!
1909	Dr. Cox	Does that...help?
1910	Carla	Like a big hug with words.
1911	Dr. Cox	Hey! The point is that just 'cause a guy has problems expressing himself, that doesn't mean he doesn't need...you.Oh, boy. Women so don't get me... it's not even funny!It's mind-boggling, quite frankly, It the whole thing...is...stunning.
1912	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
1913	J.D.	The point is, is that it's the scrubs, right? Because, in jeans, my butt is a force to be reckoned with.
1914	Elliot	Hey. We were just looking for you.
1915	J.D.	Nick! Touch my butt, please? ...Hey, you all right?
1916	Nick	That kid is eventually gonna die. Whether it's today, or tomorrow, or a month from now. There's nothing I can do; nothing works. Now his parents want to talk to me, what am I supposed to tell them "Peter lived a good, long seven years"? Seven years, man!It's not fair. I hate this place. I hate this job
1917	Elliot	Nick, it's not your fault
1918	Nick	I can't do it anymore. I I'm done...I'm done...I'm done.
1919	J.D.'s Narration	The scariest thing was that I thought he was stronger than all of us. But maybe it's not about being the best. Maybe it's about finding the little things that get you through the day.Whether it's the support of someone close to you......or letting yourself feel overwhelmed...
1920	Elliot	Okay....
1921	J.D.'s Narration	...if only for a moment.Or being selfless every once in a while.I don't know.I guess, in the end, it's about surviving......any way you can.
1922	Dr. Kelso	See you tomorrow.
1923	J.D.	Whoa!
1924	Janitor	You're stupid.
1925	J.D.	That's it?
1926	Janitor	Give it time, it'll eat at ya.
1927	J.D.	Am I stupid?
1928	Elliot	Yeah, little bit.
1929	J.D.	Damn him!

1931	J.D.'s Narration	One of the best things about my friendship with Turk is that we're always challenging each other to try new things.
1932	J.D.	I can't believe we're going to a strip club for lunch.
1933	Turk	Oh, don't even think about it that way. This is just a nice place to buy a burger that's a short, convenient two-and-a-half-mile walk away from the hospital.
1934	J.D.	Let's get outta here before we end up on the 6 o'clock news.
1935	Reporter	Excuse me, are you gentleman visiting the club?
1936	Turk	No! ...We're here protesting.
1937	J.D.	I'm worried about the kids.
1938	Reporter	So what's that in your pocket?
1939	J.D.	Oh, this is just, um, it's thirty-eight dollars in singles....I-I bought a newspaper, and this is the change from my forty.
1940	Reporter	Neil!

1945	Reporter	Coming to you live as two young doctors are trying to resuscitate my cameraman.
1946	Dr. Kelso	Well, maybe I'm biased but, to me, every doctor here at Sacred Heart is a hero. Does that mean I'm a hero? I don't know... Ahh! There's my Dynamic Duo!
1947	Press	Dr. Dorian! Dr. Turk!
1948	J.D.	Holy inferiority complex, Batman! How low is my self-esteem that I'm the sidekick in my own fantasy!?
1949	Turk	It could be worse, Robin. You could be Alfred, the Butler.
1950	J.D.	Damn you...sir.
1951	J.D.'s Narration	Life in a hospital moves so fast. One second you're a hero, the next, you're obsessing about intern evaluations.
1952	Elliot	Who cares? It's only a grade.
1953	J.D.	Really, what'd you get?
1954	Elliot	An A-plus. But, then I turned on the water-works and the resident changed it to an A-plus-plus.
1955	J.D.	It's a proud day for women everywhere.
1956	Elliot	What are you worried about? With the whole "hero" thing, whoever evaluates you is gonna give you a gold star.
1957	Dr. Cox	Listen, Super Girl: I'm gonna break you down into so many little pieces that my grandmother, who can do a thousand-piece puzzle of clear-blue sky in less than an hour, will never be able to finish putting you back together again. Even if she does go back in time to when her vision was perfect.

1962	Turk	I'm sticking with we were protesting....J.D.?
1963	J.D.	Outraged and disgusted.
1964	Carla	You should take Bambi out tonight; maybe with all the hype, you can finally get him a girl.
1965	J.D.	Okay. Who hasn't bought us drinks, yet?It could happen!
1966	Turk	Don't wait up for me tonight, okay?
1967	Carla	Okay.So, do you want to get drunk and beg me to have sex with you now, or do you wanna wait till 2 o'clock tonight?
1968	Turk	Let's wait.
1969	Carla	Cool.
1970	Elliot	You know, I'm off tonight. Um, what are you doing, Carla?
1971	Carla	I'm just...having dinner with a friend.
1972	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, man; this is so uncomfortable. She's not gonna get the invite.Just hold your breath until it's over.
1973	J.D.	You could take Elliot with you?

1981	J.D.	Nothing.
1982	Janitor	What'd you take.
1983	Dr. Cox	Newbie! Come!
1984	J.D.'s Thoughts	Now that I think about it, I'm psyched to have Dr. Cox do my evaluation. It'll give me a chance to finally see what he truly thinks of me.
1985	Dr. Cox	Look, Doogie, I'm up to my cha-chas in busy work, so I'm gonna go ahead and take a rain-check on your report card just have you do it yourself.
1986	J.D.	You didn't even fill out my name.
1987	Dr. Cox	Well, now, I think it's John, or Jimmy, or jeh , or ehnn...Oh, gosh, it's in the 'J' family; but if you get in trouble, just ask the nurses for help.
1988	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
1989	Lawyer	Sir, I've been the hospital's legal counsel for... well, let's just say when I started, I had hair.......And a wife and family.... The point is, I'll never get a raise without the support of senior staff like yourself.
1990	Dr. Kelso	Can't do it.
1991	Lawyer	Well, you did what you could!
1992	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Dorian, how are you?
1993	J.D.	Well, sir, these evaluations...
1994	Dr. Kelso	It's just a pleasantry, sport; let's keep it moving. Listen, I've been thinking, with all the publicity you and your friend have been getting, it would be silly not to milk it a little bit see if we can't promote the hospital. What do you say?
1995	J.D.	Okay, whose breasts haven't I signed yet?It could happen!
1996	Dr. Kelso	Excuse me?
1997	J.D.	Anything for the hospital, sir!
1998	Elliot	So, what are we doing tonight?
1999	Carla	Oh...go out to dinner, I guess.
2000	Elliot	Ooh, dinner! Where're we gonna eat?
2001	Carla	Oh, I don't know, some restaurant.
2002	Elliot	Mmm! Some restaurant!Be honest, um, does this look, uh, "hip" enough?
2003	Carla	Since when are khakis, a pink shirt, and a neckerchief not hip?
2004	Elliot	True.
2005	Carla	Hey!

2023	J.D.	I dunno whether to be easy or hard on myself. I mean, either way
2024	Nurse Roberts	Can't you see I'm watching my stories?
2025	J.D.	Dr. Cox? Have you been here the whole time?
2026	Dr. Cox	No; I just came in through the couch door. Move.
2027	J.D.	But I thought you said you were too busy to do my evaluation?
2028	Dr. Cox	I am. Didn't her daddy sell the coal mine?
2029	Nurse Roberts	Contract didn't stick.

2036	Reporter	Nothing! Okay, I'll be right back.
2037	J.D.	She is ta-haasty. Watch me work a little cat-and-mouse game with her.
2038	Turk	She's married to the sound-man, bud. And that little thing that's clipped to your collar, that's a microphone.
2039	J.D.	I am so sorry.... And I love ZZ Top.
2040	Turk	I'm not looking forward to this.
2041	Reporter	Okay, we're rolling. So, how is my cameraman doing?
2042	J.D.	Well, good enough that he asked me for mouth-to-mouth again!
2043	Reporter	Dr. Turk, um, are there any specific challenges being a young black doctor in an inner-city hospital?
2044	Turk	...My nieces and nephews really look up to me...
2045	Elliot	I'm I'm sorry, I really want to hear this. Is it possible to turn the volume just a little?

2052	J.D.	I, uh, finished my evaluation.
2053	Dr. Cox	Oh, great. I thought it was gonna take you a little longer, so the marching band won't be here until this evening.
2054	J.D.	Enjoy. I think you'll find it's a good read.
2055	Dr. Cox	Hey, Newbie. This thing actually does matter, so tell me, were you completely honest with yourself?
2056	J.D.	Well, yeah....
2057	Dr. Cox	Say it right into the camera, there, hotshot. Now, you can have this thing back anytime you want. You're gonna have to bark like a dog, though.

2066	J.D.	No, no, no! You're going to like it!
2067	Turk	Good. 'Cause I need some good news, man. Can you believe that newslady? "What's it like to be a black doctor?"I just wish this was over.Why have we stopped?

2070	Turk	What makes you think I'd wanna be part of this, J.D.?
2071	J.D.	I don't know! Kelso said it would make us role models. I guess I just assumed that
2072	Turk	Yeah, everybody assumes that I'm a good athlete, or or or that I grew up poor, or that I love 'Sanford and Son'.
2073	J.D.	But you do love 'Sanford and Son'.... We both do.Bum-bum-bwa-dum. Bum-bum-bwa-dum-bwa-dum-bum.
2074	Turk	Bum-bum-bwa-dum.
2075	J.D.	That's what I'm talkin' about.
2076	Cut to	The Center of the Living Room A Few Moments Later
2077	Turk	Listen, if Dr. Kelso wants me to be a "role model" for the community because I'm a great doctor, then that's great, and I will sign on the dotted line. But that's not what this is about. All my life, I've been singled out because I'm black.
2078	Young Turk	But I didn't even enter the contest!
2079	Teacher	Shh. Smile for the picture.
2080	Turk	Remember our college brochures?
2081	J.D.	So what, they put you on the cover.
2082	Turk	Twice?Ohh? Ohh!
2083	J.D.	Come on, it's different this time. Now it's both of us.You can still see my hand on your shoulder.
2084	J.D.'s Narration	And that's when I realized, I'm not gonna let people take advantage of me anymore.
2085	J.D.	Look, this is so unfair, you're supposed to do my evaluation not me. And, you know what? You're gonna do it, buddy-boy.
2086	Dr. Cox	"Buddy-boy"? Why...I...oughtta....
2087	J.D.	I'm serious.
2088	Dr. Cox	Relax, Newbie. It's just an evaluation; it should be easy.
2089	J.D.	Well, if it's that easy, then it won't take you that long to do it.
2090	Dr. Cox	All right, well, don't you worry about it another minute, there, Newbie. I'll evaluate you, I'll evaluate the hell right outta ya.
2091	J.D.	When?
2092	Dr. Cox	Oh, just the second I get off work.
2093	J.D.	Fine!
2094	Dr. Cox	Fine!
2095	J.D.	Great!

2102	Turk	So, what, this is the part where all of a sudden it's my fault?
2103	Carla	Turk, if you could have seen the look on her face I'm telling you, if I think about it again, it's gonna make me cry.What am I gonna do?
2104	Turk	It's simple: just keep doing what you're doing. Eventually she'll quit and move.
2105	Carla	Why am I even talking to you?
2106	Turk	What?
2107	Carla	You're such a guy. You can't even begin to understand something this deep on any kind of real emotional level.
2108	J.D.	Hey, Turk. Look, I'm really sorry about the whole poster thing. It was racially insensitive of me; I should have been more aware of your feelings before I went ahead and spoke for you.
2109	Turk	It's okay; your intentions were good, and there's never been an issue of race between us. Since the day I met you, you've been nothing but a friend to me.
2110	J.D.	I love you, man.
2111	Turk	Hit me one.
2112	J.D.	Keep it real!

2116	Nurse Roberts	What's that, now?
2117	Elliot	Thanks so much!TAXI!

2125	Dr. Kelso	Well, if it isn't Dr. Turk, the friendly face of Sacred Heart.
2126	Turk	Yeah.... Dr. Kelso, um, about these posters , they're kind of making me uncomfortable.
2127	Dr. Kelso	Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't realize you felt that way. Well, here's what I'm gonna do: I'm gonna leave 'em up.
2128	Turk	I can live with that. Or, I can sue you.
2129	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Turk, you are an employee, here. I can advertise however I wish. I can use your image, your name, I can manufacture tiny little Dr. Turk action figures it'll cost $12.95, and when you pull the string it'll say, "I don't like these posters of me!" Isn't that right, Ted?
2130	Lawyer	Oh, definitely, sir.Of course, you'd certainly be vulnerable from a legal standpoint.
2131	Dr. Kelso	How vulnerable?
2132	Lawyer	Sir, that lawsuit would be over so quickly, I'd advise you to bring cab fare to the courthouse, since Dr. Turk will be driving your Beemer home to his place.
2133	Dr. Kelso	Hippie!
2134	Lawyer	God, that felt good!
2135	Turk	Who's the man?
2136	Lawyer	Is it me?

2143	Carla	I'm really sorry.
2144	Elliot	Don't be. If I was going out with my friend, I wouldn't invite you.Who am I kidding. Yes, I would, and she'd probably like you better and neither one of you would ever talk to me again.
2145	Carla	Look, I only did it because I hadn't seen Patricia in a long time.
2146	Elliot	Carla, you only did it 'cause I don't fit in with you and your friend. It's no surprise, it's not like I've ever really fit in anywhere.

2152	J.D.	I'm cool with that.
2153	Dr. Cox	I'm not gonna say that. You're okay. You might be better than that someday; but right now, all I see is a guy who's so worried about what everybody else thinks of him that he has no real belief in himself.I mean, did you even wonder why I told you to do your own evaluation?
2154	J.D.	I-I can't think of a safe answer. I just figured
2155	Dr. Cox	Clam up! I wanted you to think about yourself and I mean really think. What are you good at? What do you suck at? And then I wanted you to put it down on paper. And not so I could see it, and not so anybody else could see it, but so that you could see it. Because, ultimately, you don't have to answer to me, and you don't have to answer to Kelso, you don't even have to answer to your patients, for God's sake! You only have to answer to one guy, Newbie, and that's you!There. You. Are.... Evaluated.Now get the hell outta my sight. You honest-to-God get me so angry, I'm afraid I just might hurt myself.
2156	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2157	Darryl	So, what are you, one of the male nurses?
2158	Turk	No, actually, I'm a surgeon. I'm doing this as a favor for Carla.
2159	Darryl	Yeah, Carla is fine.What's she doin' wit' you?
2160	Turk	Slummin' a little, God bless her heart. So, this is a knife cut, hey?
2161	Darryl	Yeah, it's cool.
2162	Turk	See this right here? Pinched it in a door two stitches!
2163	Darryl	Oh, man, yeah, yeah, you hard-core, man.
2164	Turk	Hell, yeah!
2165	Elliot	Look, Darryl's gonna be fine. But I'm worried about you; you're a little upset, so I'm gonna set you up in a room with some fluids, maybe give you a Valium, okay?
2166	Patricia	Elliot, thank you.
2167	Carla	Hey, there you are.
2168	Patricia	Oh, honey.
2169	Carla	Elliot, you're coming, right?
2170	Elliot	In a sec.
2171	Carla	You all right?
2172	Patricia	Yes.
2173	J.D.'s Narration	It's funny how our perceptions can be so off....
2174	Nurse Roberts	Hot cocoa, sweetie?
2175	Elliot	Thanks.
2176	Nurse Roberts	Anytime.
2177	J.D.'s Narration	...Like, when you're searching for a place to fit in, and you don't even realize you've been there the whole time.Or how a bunch of posters can't turn you into a role model if you've already been one for years.
2178	Turk	Hell yeah!
2179	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, in my case, I knew exactly where I stood. And it didn't feel that good.
2180	Dr. Cox	I would like to make special mention of one intern here: John Dorian. Smart kid, he's extremely confident, and his enthusiasm and his determination to always be better is something I see in him 24 hours a day. He cares. Probably cares too much. But he's definitely somebody you don't want to lose.Now, if you have any questions, uh...well, I could give a crap; I'm goin' home. You all get paid way too much for doing nothing, anyway.
2181	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2182	Dr. Cox	Oh, good, Newbie you found a specialty.
2183	J.D.	Nah.... I just dropped my...pen!
2184	Janitor	Well, look what magically found its way back home.
2185	J.D.	What, your window cleaner?
2186	Janitor	No. Ammonia. This is window cleaner, right, uh....Why!?
2187	J.D.	Now that's just bad luck.
2188	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2189	J.D.	As a first year intern you have very little free time. So when you finally have a night off, it's important that you do something constructive with it.
2190	Turk	Hey! Hey! Over here man!
2191	J.D.	Hey man how's it goin?I have no idea who you are.What up dude!
2192	J.D.'s Narration	Hey wait a second he's dating Carla. This is not good.
2193	Turk	First of all I already told her I got a girlfriend. Second you just put your bare lips on my ear.
2194	J.D.	How's it goin I'm-
2195	Jennifer	J.D., I know. He won't stop talking about you. I'm Jennifer.
2196	J.D.'s Narration	Mmm Jennifer.
2197	Jennifer	Do you really spend every day saving children's lives.
2198	Turk	Tell the nice lady.
2199	J.D.	I do what I can.
2200	Turk	It's on, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on!
2201	J.D.'s Narration	I know two things about bars, one they're always packed the week of Thanksgiving and two put a beer in my hand and I'm Mr. Smooth.
2202	Jennifer	I was laughing so hard milk was coming out of my nose.
2203	J.D.	Well, I once tripped over an I.V. and blood shot over everyone! Er uh a little got on my nose… Every damn day saving those children!
2204	Turk	Who wants margaritas? Dude, less blood more fruity drinks.
2205	J.D.	Right.
2206	J.D.'s Narration	That's the thing about Turk he hasn't changed a bit since college. He's still the same goofball who tells me how to be cooler.
2207	Turk	Dude, this girl's pretty hot, so try not to blow it. Okay?
2208	J.D.	Why do you say that?
2209	Turk	Because you're like a 24 hour convenience store. You never close.
2210	J.D.	That sounds like a Fat Albert joke.Don't worry about it man I feel good tonight, you know what I'm saying?. Except for this stabbing pain in my side.
2211	Turk	So he was up all night with a high fever, cramping and crying.
2212	J.D.	Dude!
2213	Turk	Oh my bad not crying. Punching the wall all manly and angry like. You know what I mean?
2214	Carla	Poor Bambi. Don't worry Carla will take care of you. Make sure he gets admitted right away.
2215	J.D.'s Narration	On the bright side it'll be interesting to see what it feels like to be a patient here.
2216	Janitor	You know people die here?
2217	J.D.	You're a good friend.
2218	Janitor	Eh, I do what I can. Can I have your stuff?
2219	Carla	So did you talk to any girls last night?
2220	Turk	Baby, I'm an attractive man we both know this. It's just a burden you'll have to live with.
2221	Carla	One of many.
2222	Turk	J.D. talked some girl up
2223	Elliot	Really are you gonna call her?
2224	Jennifer	Eh! Eck!
2225	J.D.	Not right away.
2226	Elliot	Alright, showtime. Clear out so I can check em out.
2227	J.D.	Whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah. You're examining me? I don't want you to see my unmentionables.
2228	Elliot	I've seen underwear before.
2229	J.D.	Actually I use the word unmentionables for my genitals as well.
2230	Carla	Sixty-eight year old male with respiratory distress and tightness in-
2231	Dr. Cox	Save your breath. Hello Dad.
2232	Dr. Benson	Never thought you'd call me that again after I left.
2233	Carla	Dr. Cox!
2234	Dr. Cox	Relax Carla the man I'm smothering isn't really my father. Dr Benson used to be the chief of medicine here.
2235	Dr. Benson	Oh hi how are ya?Still have that great rapport with the nurses huh?
2236	Dr. Cox	Actually Carla totally gets me. That's why I've been systematically trying to driver her away.
2237	Dr. Benson	You ever see that therapist I recommended?
2238	Dr. Cox	Not yet, no.
2239	Elliot	Shortness of breath, dizziness, problems urinating?
2240	J.D.	No, no, is it a problem if it whistles?
2241	Elliot	Oh, you're making this so much easier! Are you sexually active?
2242	J.D.	Oh it's active.
2243	Elliot	I'll write, rare dry spell in the margin. Okay time for the physical
2244	J.D.	Cold hands.
2245	Elliot	Suck it up!
2246	J.D's Narration	Elliot's exam was frighteningly reminiscent of when my older brother used to beat the crap out of me.
2247	J.D.	Ow!
2248	Elliot	See that wasn't so bad. All done.
2249	J.D.	I'm still puking every hour and my fever's pretty high but you're sure it's okay for me to be out of bed right?
2250	Dr. Cox	I don't know Dr. Benson was kind of my mentor, so don't do that annoying thing.
2251	J.D.	What annoying thing?
2252	Dr. Cox	You know when you talk.
2253	J.D.	Come on that's a little-
2254	Dr. Cox	See there it is. How does that not drive you crazy?I know you're all excited because got the gown on but under no circumstance are you to curtsy.
2255	J.D.'s Narration	He can say what he wants. The bottom line is he's showing me off.Watching Dr. Cox I realized we never really stop craving the attention of people we look up to.
2256	Dr. Cox	Any questions? Great.
2257	J.D.	He seemed nice.
2258	Dr. Cox	Careful newbie.
2259	J.D.	You know I'm hearing it now it is kind of annoying when I talk.
2260	J.D.'s Narration	I guess in a lot of relationships you regress to the person you were when you first met.
2261	Turk	So Elliot's uh exam was that bad ay?
2262	J.D.	Dude she violated me.
2263	Turk	In a good way?!
2264	Elliot	What's the deal?
2265	Turk	Ah! I think I broke my ass!
2266	Elliot	I heard you're telling everyone I violated you.
2267	J.D.	Not everyone, just the people that work here. Oh and my parents.
2268	Elliot	Was there something wrong with my exam?
2269	J.D.'s Narration	So there it is a classic trap. Two choices, either wuss out or tell the truth.
2270	J.D.	Well, you're kinda rough, yeah you're rough. And you're a little business like. Oh and you're cold.
2271	Elliot	Mm hm you mean my hands?
2272	J.D.	Yeah, those too. I just think you know you could be more comforting.
2273	J.D.'s Narration	I could tell she appreciated how hard it was for me to say that.
2274	Elliot	Do you know how annoying you are when you talk?
2275	J.D.'s Narration	Maybe not.
2276	J.D.	Hey I was watching that!
2277	Janitor	It's broken.
2278	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Cox, did you get my memo reminding all senior staff that lab coats must be worn at all times?
2279	Dr. Cox	You know I did get it there Bob, and at first I just threw it away. But then I decided that wasn't a grand enough gesture. So I made a replica of you out of straw and then I put my lab coat on it with your memo in the pocket and then I invited all the kids in the neighborhood to come over and light it on fire and whack it with sticks.
2280	Dr. Kelso	Uh huh, so I've been looking at Dr. Benson's chart. His chest X Ray was normal, his vitals are stable. So let's discharge him.
2281	Dr. Cox	Well now hold the phone there Skipper. Now, Dr. Benson should be able to stay here until he feels he's ready to go. I mean give me a break he was only the chief of medicine for ten years!
2282	Dr. Kelso	Well, I haven't had my coffee yet so I'm finding it hard coming up with a more colorful way to say who gives a crap? Actually that wasn't half bad.Our next patient is a twenty-six year old male who has presented vomiting, abdominal cramps, and fever.
2283	J.D.'s Narration	I guess I never realized how hard rounds are on the patient. It feels like you're on display.
2284	Dr. Kelso	Still Rodin's masterpiece makes us wonder, why didn't he spend a little less time thinking and a little more time at the gym?
2285	J.D.	I do cardio.
2286	Dr. Kelso	Which most likely indicates what Dr. Reid?
2287	Elliot	I'd say he has a simple case of appendicitis.
2288	Dr. Kelso	And how would you proceed Dr. Dorian?
2289	J.D.	Well, for starters I would've given me that news in private no matter how angry I was at me.
2290	Dr. Kelso	Sounds like there's some fascinating back story here, turf him to surgery. Moving on.
2291	Carla	You better watch it Bambi you don't want a hundred pound white girl mad at you. You'll flinch every time you hear a range rover.
2292	J.D.	I can't believe I have to spend all Thanksgiving here. Tell me that wouldn't kill you.
2293	Carla	Not really.
2294	J.D.	Do they celebrate Thanksgiving in your homeland?
2295	Carla	You mean Chicago?
2296	J.D.	You have a Chicago? Be nice to me, I'm getting surgery.
2297	Carla	Dr. Wen's the attending.
2298	J.D.	Yeah but who's the intern who's gonna do all the work?
2299	Turk	I get to cut you open. I get to cut you open. I get to cut you open. I get to cut you open. I get to cut you open. Uh ooh ooh. Go girl, uh uh go get it. Uh uh and go uh and down and down. Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh.
2300	J.D.'s Narration	Oh good God
2301	Elliot	So, Mr. Davis we won't be able to have you home for Thanksgiving. But you'll be eating leftovers by like Saturday.
2302	Patient	Great, and Doctor thank you so much.
2303	Elliot	You're welcome. Hey we've gotten to know each other over the last week haven't we?
2304	Patient	I'd say so.
2305	Elliot	And as a doctor you found me comforting.
2306	Patient	God no.
2307	Elliot	Come on I'm pretty good with people.
2308	Patient	You're horrible with people.
2309	Elliot	I'm warm.
2310	Patient	You're very cold, I mean your hands it's like you're a yeti.
2311	Elliot	I have bad circulation. I- I do this all day and it doesn't help.
2312	Patient	Listen sweetie, you're a very efficient competent doctor but your exams- do you examine everyone like that or just people you feel have wronged you in some way.
2313	Elliot	Well, I appreciate your opinion-.
2314	Patient	Oh no it's not an opinion. You see those guys right there they're just pretending to be asleep so you won't manhandle them anymore.
2315	Elliot	They are not.
2316	Guy	Dude what are you doing?
2317	Patient	Too frank right? I know that's probably why my mom pushed me down the stairs. She is fat though… and boring.
2318	Carla	BP 60 over palp. Is he having a heart attack?
2319	Dr. Kelso	No it's hypotension and electrical alternans on the monitor. This is Tamponade. Viral infections can cause pericarditis and a rapid accumulation of fluid. It looks like a heart attack but don't let it fool you.
2320	Carla	BP's stabilizing
2321	Dr. Cox	What do we got?
2322	Dr. Kelso	Don't worry we're fine here.
2323	J.D.'s Narration	I think it's a universal feeling to wanna be there for a good friend. That's why from now on I'm gonna stop seeing Turk as my crazy frat brother.
2324	Dr. Wen	Dr. Turk if you will.
2325	Turk	Mark for the incision right about here.
2326	J.D.'s	After all he's a highly trained competent young doctor.
2327	Turk	Dude! I'm about to bust a mad slizzice in your insides!
2328	J.D.	Sir I'd prefer it if someone other than Dr. Turk performed the surgery.
2329	Dr. Wen	Fair enough. Dr. Kotter will perform the procedure tomorrow morning.
2330	J.D.'s Narration	The best thing about good friends is how quickly things like this blow over.
2331	J.D.	You understand right?
2332	Turk	Whatever man.
2333	J.D.	You want some salsa for that chip on your shoulder?
2334	Turk	I can't believe you, I would never ever do something like this to you. You're like school in July.
2335	J.D.	What do you mean like school in July?
2336	Turk	No class.
2337	Dr. Cox	You know, you're not supposed to scare me like that sir?
2338	Dr. Benson	Oh it was just a prank. Admittedly I took it too far.
2339	Dr. Cox	Well, I still laughed but like I said I feel a little guilty that I wasn't here administering-
2340	Dr. Kelso	Hi-ho I just came to check on my favorite patient. I must have the wrong room. How are ya Dave?
2341	Dr. Benson	I'm doin great Bob. I owe you one.
2342	Dr. Cox	Hey Doc, you should go ahead and get some rest.
2343	Dr. Benson	I'll be out of your hair soon enough.
2344	Dr. Kelso	Just a sec Skipper you'll stay here until you decide you're ready to leave. For God's sake you were the chief of medicine here for over ten years. Am I right?
2345	Dr. Cox	That was just exactly what I said this morning.
2346	Dr. Kelso	Yeah it sounded familiar.
2347	Dr. Cox	Huh?
2348	Dr. Kelso	What?
2349	Dr. Cox	I was just wondering how you comb your hair so the horns don't show.
2350	Dr. Kelso	I wonder what bothers you the most? Is it that I saved his life? That he likes me as a person. I bet it's how much he respects me as a doctor. How does that taste? Bitter? Hard to get down?
2351	Carla	Here you go.
2352	Elliot	Great. Carla everyone likes you so much it makes me wonder-
2353	Carla	Why all your patients think you're a cold fish?
2354	Elliot	Oh my God you noticed?
2355	Carla	No honey they told me.
2356	Elliot	Great, anyone needs me I'll be in the supply closet eating sugar packets.
2357	Carla	Look Elliot, I'm not the kind of person who likes telling people what to do but
2358	Carla to J.D.	Here's what you should do.
2359	Carla to Turk	Here's what I think.
2360	Carla to Dr. Cox	Here's what your problem is.
2361	Carla to Elliot	You have to stop thinking of your patients as strangers.
2362	Carla to J.D.	I'm dating Turk I get it, sometimes he is a big kid. But you have to realize when it comes to work he's as capable and mature as anyone.
2363	Carla to Turk	Take those out.
2364	Turk	Baby, I was bein a walrus
2365	Carla to Turk	You have to realize that J.D.'s not only your friend but he's a patient too and he's scared.
2366	Carla to Dr. Cox	Kelso is just pushing your buttons every now and then you gotta to let something go.
2367	J.D.	Turk's not that mature he spent all yesterday being a walrus. He had straws and stuff.
2368	Turk	The only thing J.D.'s scared of is sharks and he has this weird thing with pennies, but that's it. He's not not scared about this.
2369	Dr. Cox	Kelso's not just some harmless guy pushing my buttons Carla. He's a pod person.
2370	J.D.	You're wrong.
2371	Turk	You're so wrong.
2372	Dr. Cox	Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong. You're wrong, you're wrong, you're wrong.
2373	Elliot	I think you're right. I just don't know how to connect with patients.
2374	Carla	You can start by touching them. You know holding their hand or stroking their hair or giving them a reassuring pat on the arm-
2375	Elliot	What are you doing?
2376	Carla	Nothing. You're gonna be great.
2377	Elliot	Damn right!Their, you're all set.
2378	Patient	ungh!
2379	Elliot	Ooh I'm so sorry! I didn't- I didn't
2380	Patient	Ah!
2381	Elliot	Oh I'm sorry. No, it's my watch let me get it.
2382	Patient	Ah!
2383	Elliot	Hi! Oh! I'm- I'm so sorry! Ooh let me. Ooh.
2384	Dr. Kelso	See Dave at Sacred Heart we don't treat symptoms, we treat people.
2385	Dr. Benson	Hey there's something on your back.
2386	Dr. Kelso	What does this one say?
2387	Dr. Benson	"Never stop kicking me" and on the other side is my discharge form. Uh Bob you tried to discharge me an hour before I almost died?
2388	Dr. Kelso	Well- How very clever.
2389	Dr. Cox	What? It wasn't me. In fact I think you put it there yourself to get more attention.It was me, I put it there.
2390	Turk	Hey buddy. Okay, forget about everything that's going on. We know that you're bummed out about missing Thanksgiving. So we decided to bring it to you.
2391	J.D.	Wow guys thanks. Where's the food?
2392	Janitor	Who wants the unmentionables?
2393	Carla	Bambi your fever's spiking. They're worried that your appendix might burst. So we're going into surgery now.
2394	J.D.	Who's on call tonight?
2395	Dr. Wen	Dr. Turk let's get started.
2396	J.D.'s Narration	Most doctors don't believe in the whole out of body experience thing. And I don't know if it was real or a dream but I swear I was up there watching Turk operate on me and I have to say, he's an amazing surgeon.
2397	Turk	Dude, could you not look over my shoulder while I'm doin this. It's a little unnerving.
2398	Elliot	Oh, you've got a little fever it's probably just atelectasis from laying in bed.
2399	Patient	I'm really uncomfortable.
2400	Elliot	I'm so sorry
2401	Patient	You're not gonna hug me are you?
2402	Elliot	Yeah believe me, I'm done with all that.
2403	Patient	If it'll make you feel better, I hate this whole touchy feely culture anyway.
2404	Elliot	Thank you!
2405	Patient	And that whole kiss hello thing.
2406	Elliot	Ugh
2407	Patient	Ew.
2408	Elliot	Yeah I don't want anyone touching me unless we're gonna have sex and even then I don't want them to overdo it.
2409	Patient	So where in Connecticut are you from?
2410	Elliot	Greenwich, you?
2411	Patient	Darien. I am really burning up here.Oh God that's fantastic. It's like an ice pack.
2412	Elliot	Yeah… I'm so sorry to hear about your mom. Are you at least close with your dad?
2413	Patient	See this right here? That's his work. Pretty good for a man in a wheelchair huh?
2414	Dr. Cox	Hey Doc I'm awful sorry you gotta be here on Thanksgiving night.
2415	Dr. Benson	Oh my wife can't cook anyway, she's 22. What are you doing?
2416	Dr. Cox	Forget about me what's your wife look like you don't have any pictures do ya?
2417	Dr. Benson	Not of this one.You know being back at this place
2418	Dr. Cox	Well I think I can guess.
2419	Dr. Benson	You.
2420	Dr. Cox	Oh. I-
2421	Dr. Benson	Yeah probably because you do things like show up the chief of medicine. When anybody who's been in a room with Bob Kelso for more than two minutes knows how big an ass he is.
2422	Dr. Cox	Hey go easy, I just thought-
2423	Dr. Benson	You don't think Perry, you're such a talented doctor. If you would play the game even a little you'd be in a position where you could change things around here. But you're too stubborn for that aren't ya?Alright kid. Gin, your deal.
2424	Turk	Hey, I just need to check on your incision.
2425	J.D.	Turk I was an idiot
2426	Turk	It's okay man.
2427	J.D.	No seriously man, I want you to know if I ever need surgery again I want you inside of me.
2428	Turk	I wanna be the one inside you.Look J.D. I get it. I mean to me you'll always be that geeky kid with the Pat Benatar T-Shirt on.
2429	J.D.	Dude she rocks.
2430	Turk	I just want you to know how serious I am about what I do.That's not important. You know it's still Thanksgiving for like 20 more minutes.Now you can have ginger ale and a cracker.
2431	J.D.	Ooh!
2432	Turk	Oh and I forgot, you're change… two pennies.
2433	J.D.	Get those pennies away from me!
2434	Turk	Happy Thanksgiving man.
2435	J.D.'s Narration	I guess what they say is true the people you work with really do become your family. Like your brother, and your sister in law, or that cousin you have funny feelings for,. and the crazy angry uncle everyone sort of hopes isn't coming this year.
2436	Dr. Cox	Nobody talk, just drink.
2437	J.D.'s Narration	Ah uncomfortable silences and alcohol… just like Thanksgiving at home.
2438	Dr. Cox	Drink!
2439	J.D.	Their was the Nina…
2440	Dr. Cox	Shut up!
2441	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2442	J.D.	Hey. What are you doin'?
2443	Turk	Reading a book. About how to tell my room-mate he drives me crazy sometimes without hurting his feelings.
2444	J.D.	I think sarcasm works better when it's shorter.
2445	Turk	Fascinating.
2446	J.D.	Yeah, see, there ya go.So, what are you doin'?
2447	Turk	You realize you're annoying me?
2448	J.D.	Yeah; I'm okay with it.
2449	Turk	J.D., I've had such a crappy morning in this hell-hole that I decided to come out here and eat my lunch. This spot feels secluded I mean, it's so peaceful. I feel like I'm getting my spirit back.
2450	J.D.	It's just a bench.
2451	Turk	Sit down, sweet thing. Sit down.
2452	J.D.	Nice. You know, I've already eaten, but I suppose I could
2453	Turk	Okay, what's it gonna take for you to leave this second?
2454	J.D.	Your cupcake.This is how I get _my_ spirit back.Mmm-mmm! ...I feel _alive_ again! I feel alive again! Alive again! I feel alive....!
2455	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay. You know what? It's time to change this pattern.
2456	J.D.	Morning.
2457	Janitor	How do you figure?
2458	J.D.	Just doing a little drilling, huh?
2459	Janitor	Yeah.
2460	J.D.	Look, I have an idea: Let's try and go the whole day without getting in each other's hair; you know, just...give each other a break...? What do you say?
2461	Janitor	I'm gonna give you a nickname.
2462	J.D.	That that's good, but you know, I already I have a nickname; it's...it's "J.D."
2463	Janitor	How 'bout, uh...Whiny Face.... Whiny Britches! Whiny...something I definitely like "whiny."Uh, Whiny Dancer!
2464	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2465	J.D.	Ohhh, I can't believe I went out last night.
2466	Carla	I thought you said you were exhausted?
2467	J.D.	I was, but I figured I owed it to the ladies!
2468	Carla	Do you ever stop giving?
2469	J.D.'s Narration	It's hard for doctors and nurses to be long-term friends....
2470	Carla	His O-2 set's dropping; I think he just needs respiratory treatment.
2471	J.D.'s Narration	You see, when you start out, the nurses know more than you. But after a few months, the training kicks in and you both feel the dynamic shift.
2472	J.D.	Uhhhh...actually, Carla, I think, because of the congestive heart failure, he just needs Lasix.
2473	J.D.'s Narration	The future of the relationship depends on how she handles that very moment.
2474	Carla	I'm so proud of you, Bambi.They grow up so fast!
2475	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2476	Elliot	Dr. Cox!
2477	Dr. Cox	And there you are!
2478	Elliot	Excuse me?
2479	Dr. Cox	I was just now wondering if there's anything that could actually push my headache into a full-blown migraine, and...there you are.What's the story on the admit in 64?
2480	Elliot	Oh, she's great! I really like her!
2481	Dr. Cox	Yeah, let's see if you can't focus on things that I actually give a rat's ass about.What?
2482	Elliot	She blacked out at work and presented with accelerated heartbeat and hyperventilating.
2483	Dr. Cox	Interesting.
2484	Jill	I don't care if it wasn't 'good first-date conversation' Michael deserved to know what I think about circumcising babies. I mean, over my dead body! What? ... Actually, no...no, it wasn't, which is surprising because he's Jewish.
2485	Elliot	I gave her two Valium.
2486	Jill	Okay, I'm e-mailing you as we're talking HOW COOL IS THAT!!
2487	Dr. Cox	So, she's actually sedated as we speak?
2488	Elliot	Mm-hmm!
2489	Jill	Okay, bye.Hey, Elliot! Okay, first impression: Did I scare Michael off?
2490	Elliot	No!
2491	Dr. Cox	No.... Not if he enjoys a big, fat cup-a crazy!Miss Tracey, we're all extremely busy, so if we could get down to business, that would be
2492	Elliot	Oh, my God! I have the exact same e-mailing pagey thingie!
2493	Jill	Oh, get out!
2494	Dr. Cox	Ahahaha! Oh!
2495	Jill	Oh, my God. My "H" sticks a little bit; does your "H" stick?
2496	Elliot	It does, it does, it does!
2497	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2498	Turk	Baby, it may just be a bench, but you know what? It's quiet, and I can chill. It's like my special place.
2499	Carla	You are so damn cute, I can't even _stand_ it!
2500	Turk	Serious?
2501	Carla	Yeah. I love it that my man's all deep and whatnot.
2502	Turk	You know, I get deep.
2503	Carla	I know.
2504	J.D.	Hey-hey-hey what's happenin', Rerun.
2505	Turk	What up, Raj!
2506	J.D.	Okay, how 'bout a little of this.
2507	Carla	Oh, come on, it wasn't even that good a show.
2508	J.D.	Take it back.
2509	Turk	This second.Ooh, look at the time! Gotta go it's lunch-time! See you, Baby!
2510	J.D.	Are we still on for that, uh, Bresson exhibit?
2511	Carla	Yes, we are.
2512	Turk	Oh, I'm sorry, uh...did somebody just ask out my girlfriend?
2513	J.D.	You wanna come?
2514	Carla	Oh: Black and white photography; very artsy-fartsy; no boobies.
2515	Turk	Hell, no.Hello, sir.
2516	Dr. Kelso	Nice spot.
2517	Turk	Yes, sir...it is.
2518	Dr. Kelso	I usually try to get out here for lunch every day at 12:30.
2519	Turk	You don't say....
2520	Dr. Kelso	Yep. Every day. 12:30. For twenty-three years.
2521	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2522	Janitor	Hey, from now on, your name is "Scooter."
2523	J.D.	I don't get it.
2524	Janitor	It's short for "Scooter Pie."I hate Scooter Pies.
2525	J.D.	Oh. Now I see.
2526	J.D.'s Thoughts	You big jerk.
2527	Carla	Hey, thanks again for the invite, Bambi; I love photography.
2528	J.D.	Baby, photography is for studs.
2529	J.D.'s Narration	After working at a hospital for a while, you develop a sixth sense for danger.Maybe there's a mass cas. alert...maybe there's a code.......Maybe someone spent the morning with the most annoying patient in the world and needs to vent.Luckily, I was prepared.
2530	Dr. Cox	Did you do your pre-rounds?
2531	J.D.	Yes.
2532	Dr. Cox	Discharge summaries?
2533	J.D.	Yes.
2534	Dr. Cox	Pharmacy renewals?
2535	J.D.	Yes!
2536	Dr. Cox	S.O.A.P. notes?
2537	J.D.	Yes.
2538	Dr. Cox	Central line changes.
2539	J.D.	Yes.
2540	Dr. Cox	Okay, Janet. But...did you go ahead and fix your beeper so it doesn't play that annoying song every single time you get paged?
2541	J.D.	...Yes.
2542	J.D.'s Thoughts	Crap.
2543	Dr. Cox	I expect you to act like a professional around here!
2544	J.D.	Is that all you got!?!Good one!
2545	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2546	Dr. Kelso	Interesting tidbit: Back during the gold rush, when a man staked a claim, if he came upon another man panning his spot...why, he could shoot that fella dead without even asking any questions.
2547	Turk	You don't say.
2548	Dr. Kelso	Simpler times.
2549	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2550	Jill	Okay, what if you've had three great dates and he likes you so much, he hasn't even tried to have sex with you yet?
2551	Elliot	Ooh. I could sabotage that relationship in two phone calls.
2552	Jill	I could do it in one.
2553	Elliot	Jill, Sabotage That Relationship!
2554	Jill	For starters, I would ask him why he finds me so repulsive, then I would coerce him into having phone sex with me, after which I would ask him if he thinks we have a future together...and then I'd probably just cry until he hung up on me.
2555	Elliot	We are _so_ alike!
2556	Jill	I know!
2557	Dr. Cox	Oh, stop! No, you stop! Oh, dear God.Miss Tracey, we're gonna go ahead
2558	Jill	Can you just give me one sec I'm on The Zone, I'm trying to arrange to have the food delivered here.
2559	Elliot	Mm.
2560	Jill	Fatty had a party and nobody came!
2561	Elliot	Preachin' to the choir.
2562	Dr. Cox	Okay. Think of what little patience I have as...oh, I don't know...your virginity: You always thought it would be there, until that night junior year when you were feeling a little down about yourself and your pal Kevin who _just_ wanted to be friends well, he dropped by, and he brought a copy of 'About Last Night' and a four-pack of Bartles and James and ba-dow! hoo-hoo-hoo! it was gone forever! ...Just like my patience is now.
2563	Jill	So you do scary little speeches.... How adorable!
2564	Elliot	This is so much fun!
2565	Dr. Cox	Careful, Rapunzel.
2566	Elliot	Oh!
2567	Dr. Cox	Fun time is officially over.
2568	Carla	You think you can just treat Bambi like that and walk away?
2569	Jill	Get him, girlfriend!
2570	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2571	Todd	What up, T-Dog!
2572	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, the only way to avoid the high-five with Todd is not to say anything that he can connect to sex.
2573	Todd	How you doin'?Dude; that's totally how my car was rockin' when I took this girl out last night.Am I right?
2574	J.D.'s Thoughts	Ahh, he earned it.
2575	J.D.	Pain.
2576	Turk	So Cox tore into you, huh?
2577	J.D.	Yeah; you know what really pisses me off? Is that no one ever calls him on anything, you know?
2578	Carla	You wanna kick and scream while you're teaching people here, that's fine. But if you _ever_ yell at my friend again over _nothing_, then I will personally wipe that scary smile off your face, put it in my purse, and keep it there until no one around here is any more scared of you than I am.
2579	J.D.	It's not fair. Wait, why are you eating in here?
2580	Todd	T-Man's afraid of Kelso.
2581	Turk	I'm not afraid of Kelso! I just felt like eating in here.
2582	J.D.	Go outside and stand up for yourself!
2583	Turk	Hell, yeah!
2584	Todd	Dude. You know what else stands up for itself?
2585	J.D.	You know, Todd, I'm not sure, but I'm I'm gonna guess that it's your penis.
2586	Todd	It is!
2587	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, no.
2588	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2589	Dr. Cox	Everyone, we can all relax now the planets have been realigned and order shall be returned to the people.Hey. You.
2590	Elliot	Just give me two seconds, I've just gotta finish e-mailing Jill.
2591	Dr. Cox	I have, right here, your little friend's test results. Shall we have some fun and take a look?Hmm. Interesting. EKG negative. Tilt-table negative. Echo negative. Nyet, nada, zilch nothing, in fact, is wrong with her but a little stress and exhaustion brought on most likely by ohh, let it come being her!
2592	Elliot	Yeah, but if
2593	Dr. Cox	No-no, no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no, no, NO! There's no time for 'yeah...but's. I want her punted outta here in the next five minutes or you will personally be responsible for covering every missed shift during this year's flu season. Now go. Now go. Now go.Hey, you.For what it's worth, I don't care if your beeper plays "Who let the dogs out woof, woof" as many times as ya like.
2594	J.D.	Actually, sir, it's "who, who", but thank you! That that's great.
2595	Dr. Cox	Sure. Oh, and Ginger, by the way, just a real smooth move running to your mommy.
2596	J.D.	'Scuse me?
2597	Dr. Cox	Yeah, your mommy ca-rushed me. She did. Uh, I'd like to issue a warning to everybody and I'm dead serious FYI: J.D.'s mommy has made it perfectly clear that she doesn't want her daughter picked on anymore. Nothing mean! She's a precious flower, and we should all be super-nice to her!

2599	Cut to	Hospital Interior An Empty Room
2600	Turk	I was paged! Hello? Anyone?Oh, hell no!
2601	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2602	Jill	When I get out of here, we should totally hang!
2603	Elliot	I'd love to! I should warn you, though, I work a ton, and when I'm off I usually stay at home to catch up on paperwork or read medical journals just to stay ahead of the curve. Oh, I'm a nerd.
2604	Jill	Man, I wish I could stay home and read sometimes, you know? But, my job, it's like, Mm! you know? And with the "Married by the Millennium" thing still hanging over my head, I go on, like, a thousand blind dates. And then there's all my friends who, like, always need something. And there's me, who's, like, never wants to let anyone down, you know, ever! You know, with so many balls in there air, sometimes it gets, uh, it gets a little overwhelming! As soon as I leave here, I know I'm going right back to that mess. Oh, my God, I'm practically crying. How pathetic is that!
2605	J.D.'s Narration	Around here you have to make big choices every day.
2606	Elliot	Well, actually, I I came down here to tell you that, uh, we're gonna keep you here for the weekend just to get some rest.
2607	J.D.'s Narration	To tell you the truth, most of these choices actually have nothing to do with medicine.
2608	Turk	It's so on.
2609	J.D.'s Narration	In those cases, you have to make sure that your emotions don't get the best of you.
2610	Dr. Cox	Mommy...Mommy...Mommy...Mommy.
2611	Carla	Give me that, Bambi! That's not a toy!
2612	J.D.	Look, my name is not Bambi! Okay!? It's Dr. Dorian. And I don't I don't really need to be looked after, okay?! So loo how about I'll be the doctor, and you just...you be the nurse!
2613	Carla	Yes, Doctor.
2614	J.D.'s Thoughts	Good choice.
2615	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2616	Carla	I ha I have to go check on something.
2617	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, you gotta fix this before word gets around.
2618	J.D.	Look, Carla, wait.
2619	Turk	What did you do!?!
2620	Dr. Cox	What did you do!
2621	Elliot	What did you do?
2622	J.D.	She called me "Bambi" in front of everyone. My name is not Bambi!
2623	Janitor	It's Scooter!
2624	J.D.	Ugh!
2625	Janitor	It's short for Scooter Pie.
2626	Turk	Baby, J.D. is my best friend, but, listen, if you need me to kick his ass, I will kick his ass! 'Cause I care for you.
2627	Carla	And 'cause I'm willing to sleep with you.
2628	Turk	Hell, yeah.
2629	Carla	Well, sweetie, you know if I wanted his ass kicked, I'd do it myself.
2630	Todd	Meow!
2631	Carla	Todd, if you ever make that horny cat noise at me again, I will reach into your mouth and unscrew that 7-watt bulb that barely keeps your brain open for business.
2632	Turk	Damn!
2633	Todd	Dude, chick threats are hot.
2634	Turk	What did I tell you about annoying Carla? If she makes me choose between the two of you, you know how it's gonna end up.
2635	Todd	Yes, I do. And I thank you for that.

2638	Jill	Good morning, sunshine!

2640	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2641	J.D.'s Narration	There's nothing worse than knowing you've wronged a friend and having to just lay it all out there and apologize.
2642	J.D.	Look, Carla
2643	Carla	It's okay. You over-reacted.
2644	J.D.	Yeah, but
2645	Carla	I should have realized you can stand up for yourself.
2646	J.D.	Well, actually, I
2647	Carla	Sweetie, I know you would take it back if you could; I do! We're okay, right?
2648	J.D.	I think I've said all I can.

2653	Elliot	For what?
2654	Dr. Cox	Hello, sad clown. Thanks for paging her.
2655	Elliot	How could you?
2656	Jill	He he called me "Cutie" and then he said something about my eyes...being as blue as the ocean I...I got confused.
2657	Elliot	Yeah, it probably woulda worked on me, too.
2658	Dr. Cox	You're damn right it would've. Come.

2664	Dr. Kelso	Consider that your last supper; I'm bored with the games.
2665	Turk	Are...you forbidding me to sit here?
2666	Dr. Kelso	This is a public bench; you are as welcome here as I am. But you won't come back again, you know why? Because you just don't have the mettle. Now get the hell out of here so I can eat my wife's egg salad sandwich before the tomato soaks through the bread!Beautiful day!
2667	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2668	J.D.	So, did you, uh did you get into photography when you were in college, or...?
2669	Carla	No; actually, I never went to college.
2670	J.D.	Ah. Don't tell any of my patients, but neither did I.
2671	Carla	What, is that supposed to make me feel better or something?
2672	J.D.	What? No, no, that's just it's just a joke. I'm doing the whole, like, "Turn that frown upside-down...."
2673	Carla	Yeah, you know what? Hold it! I don't think we're okay.
2674	J.D.	Wait! You just accepted my apology. You can't take it back!
2675	Carla	Have you _ever_ spent time with a woman?!
2676	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2677	Elliot	Is my punishment still coming, or is it just the horrible staring? Because the anticipation is killing me.
2678	Dr. Cox	Make your case.
2679	Elliot	Uh, I'm sorry, what?
2680	Dr. Cox	Well, you tell me why Chorey McCrazy Chore should get to stay here two more nights.
2681	Elliot	Okay.... You don't understand how hard it is for some women to make it on their own nowadays. I mean, Jill is _so_ exhausted, and it's not gonna get any easier because she's her own worst enemy, you know? I mean, she's constantly trying to please everyone! She judges herself harsher than anyone does.
2682	Dr. Cox	Have you actually seen what _you_ look like today?
2683	Elliot	I know: I'm a skank! And she never says no to anyone, so
2684	Dr. Cox	Could you swing by my apartment after work, pick up a sample of my dog's stool, then take it to the vet for me?
2685	Elliot	I can do it at lunch.Oh....
2686	Dr. Cox	It's okay. Jill can stay a little longer. And if we're real lucky, she'll realize that it's okay to give yourself a break every once in a while. Right?
2687	Elliot	Yeah....
2688	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2689	J.D.	Hey, I I took a cab from the last stop you forgot your coat.
2690	Carla	I don't want it.
2691	J.D.	Why would you?
2692	Carla	You know I was only gonna go to that stupid exhibit because I wanted you to think I was brainy or something. I'm so angry at myself.
2693	J.D.	Oh, thank goodness; 'cause I thought you were mad at me.
2694	Carla	I've had hundreds of interns decide that they don't need me anymore. Why should You see, this is why you can't be friends with doctors.
2695	J.D.	Look, Carla, if it's a problem, then you, me, and Elliot and Turk, we'll get together and
2696	Carla	I don't work with Turk! And I'm not that close to Elliot. The only problem here is _you_, okay? We're supposed to be friends. Your self-esteem is so wrapped up in what you do. You're a doctor that's all you are, that's how you define yourself. And you think that you're better than me because of it.
2697	J.D.	Carla, I do not think
2698	Carla	Admit it. Admit it right now, or I'll never respect you again.
2699	J.D.	Okay, sometimes that's true.Carla, you're a good nurse.
2700	Carla	I'm a _great_ nurse; you patronizing ass.You don't even get it, do you? For nine years, I never once felt bad about myself for what I do not for one second. And then I met you.
2701	J.D.	Please wait.
2702	Carla	Don't!
2703	Cut to	The Hospital
2704	J.D.	Hey.
2705	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes the only way to take a really good look at yourself is through someone else's eyes. If you're lucky, you'll like what you see.
2706	Dr. Kelso	Impressive.
2707	J.D.'s Narration	Or you'll learn from it.If you don't like what you see, I guess all you can do is hope that you haven't burned too many bridges.
2708	J.D.	Hey, Carla, how many M.A.Q.s of potassium should I give this guy?
2709	Carla	You know the answer to that; don't do that. But thanks, Bambi.
2710	J.D.'s Narration	From that moment on, I knew I'd be "Bambi" forever.
2711	Dr. Cox	See you tomorrow, Scooter.
2712	J.D.'s Thoughts	He's actually very talented.
2713	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2714	J.D.'s Narration	Ahh, Christmas Eve. Unfortunately, when you spend every waking moment in a hospital, it's kinda hard to get into the spirit.
2715	Nurse Roberts	Are you aware that you are in everyone's way?
2716	J.D.	Everyone's way? Or _your_ way? Think about it.Thank God.
2717	J.D.'s Thoughts	Still, there are some traditions I enjoy. Like Nurse Tisdale's 9:15 cup-a coffee.
2718	Elliot	Carla, what time is it?
2719	Carla	Ohh, I don't know, but I'm guessing it's about hmm 9:15ish?
2720	J.D.	Oh , this thing?Who put this up!?
2721	Janitor	I did. I drove around the whole city before my 5 a.m. shift just...looking for that trying to add a little cheer. You will not ruin my Christmas. Not again. Not this year.
2722	J.D.	But I've only worked here for three months.
2723	J.D.'s Thoughts	Things could be worse, I could be with Elliot, doing my mandatory day in the free clinic.
2724	Elliot	I understand that you took a cab all the way down here that doesn't mean that I can give you Vicodin because your teeth are itchy.Dr. Kelso!
2725	Dr. Kelso	You know, I don't want to sound insensitive, but why don't these people have any money?
2726	Elliot	Uh...I I don't know, sir. They probably waste it all on...food.Dr. Kelso, I need to present a patient: Nineteen-year-old complaining of abdominal pain turns out she's at least eight months pregnant. I'm just gonna let one of the Family Practice people handle it.
2727	Dr. Kelso	Well, that sounds like a wonderful idea, sweetheart; except I heard your smart-alleck remark a second ago, so why don't you just keep your little pregnant girl. It'll be good practice for you, since you'll probably end up in a female specialty, anyway.
2728	Elliot	What do you mean by that? I'm Internal Medicine.
2729	Dr. Kelso	Well, of course you are. But numbers don't lie, and most women end up in ON-GYN, Family Practice, or Pediatrics. It's like a rip-tide, sweetheart pulling and pulling, and you can swim against the current all you want; but when Mr. Stork comes a-calling, you're not gonna be thinking, "I'm Internal Medicine" nope. It's gonna be, "Ohhhh, look at the baby!"
2730	Elliot	Sir. I have to say, I'm offended!

2732	Dr. Cox	Newbie, stay! Ohh, what a good boy you are.... Dear God, Judy, how much product do ya use?
2733	J.D.	None! It's like this when I wake up.
2734	Dr. Cox	Yeah. Quick tip, there, sports-star when you're defensive about your feminine side, it just makes you seem more girly.
2735	J.D.	I assume you want something.
2736	Dr. Cox	Easy; nobody likes a cranky punching bag. And yes, it's about a patient pretty good friend of mine, actually.
2737	J.D.'s Thoughts	Wow. I guess that means he respects me a little.
2738	J.D.	Huh!
2739	Dr. Cox	Hey, Randy, Jackie, whatta ya say? This is the monkey I got to videotape the birth.
2740	J.D.'s Thoughts	I hate him.....but not as much as moments like these. There's nothing I can do for that guy, and yet, when I go in there, the whole family's gonna look at me like I got some magical power to fix him.
2741	Patient	Hey, everybody!
2742	J.D.	Heyyy.I'm sorry, but it's been two weeks and your son shows no neurological improvement.
2743	Turk	It was a miracle! First of all, the man was damn-near dead; then he comes out!
2744	J.D.	Oh, you're ridiculous.
2745	Turk	He was damn-near J.D., I'm telling you, it was a miracle!
2746	J.D.	It was not a miracle!
2747	Turk	Yes it _was_ a miracle! Dude!
2748	J.D.'s Narration	I kind of envy Turk to be that sure of something, to have that faith of course, that doesn't mean I don't love busting him about it.
2749	J.D.	Okay; so you think _God_ was responsible for his recovery?
2750	Turk	Mm-hmm!
2751	J.D.	That's fine; we all have our beliefs. I, for instance, carry around this tiny little Monopoly piece for good luck.
2752	Turk	Did you just compare my Lord and Savior to a tiny top-hat?
2753	Carla	He did, I heard him, Baby. Go get him.
2754	J.D.	Oh, excuse me, Nurse Theresa, have _you_ ever read the Bible?
2755	Carla	I started it...but then I skipped to the end and it ruined it for me.
2756	Turk	That's it the both of you to the window. Let's go.
2757	Carla	I'm goin'!
2758	Turk	Right now.See, when they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. Matthew...2:10.
2759	J.D.	Dude, that's just the big Christmas tree in Miller Park.
2760	Carla	I understand what you're saying, Baby.
2761	Turk	Oh, no, no; please. You can't just jump back on my good side. You see all of this right here? And this? And this? Consider yourself cut off full love embargo, Baby.
2762	Carla	Baby, that's not gonna last.
2763	Turk	It will last.
2764	Carla	Oh, yeah?
2765	Turk	It's gonna last.
2766	Carla	What if I came up to you all tired, you know, and I just... I had to yawn...?
2767	Turk	Damn!
2768	Carla	How pathetic is that?
2769	J.D.	Do it again. Please?
2770	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2771	Meredith	Oh, this is from last night the Christmas tree over at Miller Park? God, I love that tree; it's so beautiful, isn't it? I've been there almost every night this week.
2772	Elliot	Listen, Meredith, you're pregnant pretty far along, actually....
2773	Meredith	What? That's not possible. What am I supposed to do?
2774	Dr. Kelso	Ohhh, look at the baby!
2775	Elliot	Um, babies aren't really my thing, so, uh...I'm just gonna go get you someone else to talk to.
2776	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2777	Dr. Cox	Oh, come on, it's great to see you guys again, really all three of ya!What is it with friends and the whole wanting to be in your life thing.
2778	J.D.	It's selfish, is what it is.
2779	Jordan	I thought I got Randy and Jackie in the divorce.
2780	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, God, his ex-wife. The tension actually hurts. You have to break it; say something, anything!
2781	J.D.	Banana hammock!
2782	Dr. Cox	I'm betting your ability to thrive under pressure is what drove you to medicine.
2783	Jordan	Oh, please, you should've seen him when he was a new intern: "I don't want to be a doctor!"
2784	J.D.	You know, I think we all know that's just not true.
2785	Dr. Cox	I'm assuming, since you already went ahead and took everything else, that you're here for my self respect but there's bad news on that one, sweet-cheeks: I already gave it to your mom when she begged me to marry ya!
2786	Jordan	Oh, I wouldn't have room for it, anyway, what with your testicles in my trophy case.
2787	Dr. Cox	Holy cow. Who's better? I you got me by the short hairs.
2788	Jordan	See ya.

2790	J.D.	What do you hate most about the holidays?
2791	Carla	Wrapping presents. You?
2792	J.D.	My family.
2793	Nurse Roberts	I don't know how anyone can get in the spirit around here.
2794	Turk	Come on, guys! All the spirit you need is right here. Can I get a Amen-a!
2795	J.D.'s Narration	One thing about Turk: He's always been good at rallying people.
2796	Reverend Turk	Congregation, I said, Can I get a Amen?
2797	Congregation	Amen!
2798	Reverend Turk	'Tis the season of giving, y'all!And what better place to give than right here, at Sacred Heart?"Lovest thou Me...then feed my sheep."But right here, at Sacred Heart, we are not only gonna feed His sheep but we gonna clothe them.And we gonna bathe them!And we gonna cut 'em open.... And then we gonna stitch 'em right back together!Because that is what Christmas! is all about-a!
2799	Sister Carla	All right! Preach! Preach!
2800	Reverend Turk	What's the name of the song we singin' today?
2801	Choir	"Oh, Christ the Lord!"
2802	Reverend Turk	Sing it, choir!
2803	Choir	"Oh, Christ the Lord!"
2804	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2805	Turk	Right, listen: I'm on call tonight but, tomorrow morning when I get home, we're all going to mass before work, okay?
2806	Carla	Okay, Sweetie.
2807	J.D.'s Thoughts	I don't wanna go to mass in the stupid mor Oooh, hey! Candy!
2808	J.D.	I was just I was trying to, uh....
2809	Janitor	Oh, I know exactly what you're trying to do; but you're not going to break my Christmas spirit you can't, not ever. I'm the holly, jolly janitor. Hi, little girl, what do you want for Christma Oof!
2810	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2811	Randy	I know you must be busy; it's really nice of you to offer to do this.
2812	J.D.	Oh, it's no problem.
2813	J.D.'s Narration	Childbirth has been so romanticized.... I guess because if people really knew the truth....
2814	Narrator	Congratulations! You're expecting! Don't worry your doctor will tell you everything you need to know.Hi, Doctor!
2815	J.D.	You'll fart, pee, puke, and poop in front of ten complete strangers who'll be staring intently at your vagina which, by the way, has an eighty percent chance of tearing!
2816	Jackie	You do it.
2817	J.D.'s Narration	Still, no matter what the realities, the end result is always the same.
2818	J.D.	Oh, look at the baby!
2819	Obstetrician	It's a bouncing baby boy! Yet another soldier in the fight against communism!
2820	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2821	Elliot	Where's the girl that was in here?
2822	Orderly	I just make beds.
2823	Elliot	Hello, I just got Meredith Fox's blood-work back and she's got HELLP Syndrome she needs to deliver immediately, so let's get her in a room and What do you mean she just left? Get me any contact numbers.Why'd she leave?
2824	Orderly	Again: Bed-maker.
2825	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2826	Dr. Cox	Newbie, I always punch the tabs out of my tapes so there's no possible way they can be recorded over. So, puh-lease tell me you didn't use the tape that was already in the camera.
2827	J.D.	Banana hammock.
2828	Dr. Cox	So, in other words, there is no permanent historical record of the birth of my friends' baby.
2829	J.D.	Well... I think that the baby, itself, would serve as proof that it was...you know...born.
2830	Dr. Cox	You don't understand what you've done. My ex-wife is probably gonna hold this over my head for so long that I doubt I'll ever see the sun again. And I like the sun, Newbie; it made me hopeful.
2831	J.D.	Well, I was there; you know, I could certainly jot down some of my feelings and...impressions.
2832	J.D.'s Thoughts	You know, if he was really mad at me, he would've stayed and yelled at me.
2833	Dr. Cox	Don't kid yourself, Newbie I couldn't _be_any madder at you!Oh! Ah! Do _not_ do that again! That's a bad newbie! Oh, bad! Oh, bad!Bad!Ah! Oh! Oh! Oh! Bad newbie!
2834	J.D.'s Thoughts	At least I can go home now.
2835	J.D.'s Narration	You see, maybe it's because Christmas is a hard time for people, maybe it's because too many families get together, but, statistically, Christmas Eve it's one of the worst nights of the year to be on-call.
2836	J.D.	I can't believe I'm wearing a suit at 6:30 in the morning.
2837	Carla	If you ruin this for Turk, I'll have to hurt you.
2838	J.D.	Noted.
2839	Carla	Hey! You better hurry up mass start s in fifteen minutes.
2840	Turk	I'm not going.
2841	J.D.	Great! Can I go back to bed?I'm kidding! Let's do it I wanna get me some of them church crackers.
2842	Turk	No, I'm not going ever.
2843	Carla	Baby? What happened? Turk? Turk, come on.
2844	J.D.'s Thoughts	Merry Christmas.
2845	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2846	J.D.	I think you're over-reacting.
2847	Elliot	A young pregnant girl said, "What am I gonna do," and I said, "Oh, babies aren't my thing"! How could I possibly be too hard on myself?
2848	J.D.'s Thoughts	Just don't say "banana hammock."
2849	J.D.	Look, I'm sure she'll turn up.
2850	Turk	Yeah, that's exactly what's gonna happen: She'll definitely turn up, she'll have a healthy baby, and nothing'll ever happen to either one of 'em.
2851	J.D.'s Narration	I never really thought of faith as important; but without his, I don't know, Turk kinda seems like he's fading away.Me, I could use a little faith. I have to tell the Wheelers I didn't tape a thing.
2852	Jordan	You made some interesting choices with the camera, Orson you didn't want to see any faces?
2853	J.D.	Excuse me?
2854	Dr. Cox	I switched the tapes, just go with it.
2855	Randy	Here he comes! I see the head!
2856	Jordan	Oh, what a gorgeous head of hair!
2857	Jackie	That's funny he was completely bald when he was in here a few minutes ago.
2858	Dr. Cox	Yeah, well....
2859	J.D.	We shaved the baby.
2860	Jordan	You shaved the baby?
2861	J.D.	Shaved it....
2862	Dr. Cox	Well, it's standard procedure, what with the recent outbreak of pre-natal lice.
2863	J.D.	Yep; definitely. Shave and a hair-cut...two bits.
2864	Jordan	Really?Yeah, I'm not buying it.
2865	Jackie	And you two are gonna go by the nursery and see Baby Charlie, right?
2866	Dr. Cox	Absolutely.
2867	Jordan	Yes! Charlie and his new hair-cut!
2868	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2869	Elliot	Have we checked all the other hospitals?
2870	Nurse Roberts	They haven't seen her, honey.
2871	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Reid? Isn't this your day off?
2872	Elliot	Actually, it's that pregnant girl I was telling you about.
2873	Dr. Kelso	Oh, right! The one who went missing. And now you're here, voluntarily, hell-bent on finding one of your little lost ducklings.
2874	Elliot	Dr. Kelso, I think it's important you understand something: I'm not interested in babies I don't coo when I'm around them, I don't melt when I see them, I don't have some yearning to make them my life's work I'm a doctor who's interested in my patients male or female and right now one of them needs help.
2875	Dr. Kelso	God! Do I know women.
2876	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2877	Turk	I don't get it. Why are we on the roof?
2878	Carla	I just wanted to show you that, no matter how ugly things can get down there, there's still a lot of beauty up here.
2879	Turk	Is that gum...or pigeon crap on my sneaker?
2880	Carla	Come on, look around! There's nobody here...no one can see us...we could do whatever we wanted....
2881	Turk	Like what?
2882	Carla	Okay, how are you not getting this?
2883	Turk	Oh, you you mean, have relations. You wanna have relations right here on the roof.
2884	Carla	Mm-huh.
2885	Turk	Baby, there's a lot of pebbles on the ground; it'll make my ass look like a chocolate-chocolate chip.
2886	Carla	I can make you see God again or at least call out his name.
2887	Turk	Is this a joke to you!?
2888	Carla	No. I'm I'm just trying to help you feel better.
2889	Turk	Baby, you don't know how I feel!
2890	Carla	Well, then, tell me!
2891	Turk	I feel abandoned! All my life, I believed that God listens to our prayers, and that He cares for us, and that He watches over us. And last night, there were so many people that needed to be watched over. How am I supposed to believe in someone that is willing to let innocent people suffer? Huh? Answer me. Please!
2892	Carla	I can't.
2893	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2894	J.D.	Did you go see Baby Charlie yet?
2895	Dr. Cox	Oh, yeah, I was actually just planning on doing that...never.
2896	J.D.	You're such a special friend.
2897	Dr. Cox	Well, gosh, Marjorie, aren't you sassy today! Did Santa finally bring you the Y chromosome you always wanted?
2898	J.D.	What's your problem, anyway?
2899	Dr. Cox	Well, for starters, I hate Christmas.I don't like Bambasnoodles; I loathe dinkowallows; I _hate_ stagtomgoppers. I say, do you follow?
2900	Jordan	Do you think I'm a moron?
2901	Dr. Cox	Newbie!! Don't answer that question! It's a trick, that's a trick!
2902	Jordan	Oh, pre-natal lice? You do realize that would be lice _in the womb_!
2903	Dr. Cox	Oh, I've seen 'em; they're real. And they're gross.
2904	J.D.'s Narration	Maybe Dr. Cox has pushed me too far, I don't know; whatever it was, I told on him.
2905	J.D.	Plus, he didn't even go see Baby Charlie yet.
2906	J.D.'s Narration	And then something amazing happened they connected. And all the hatred they had for each other was suddenly focused on me!
2907	Jordan	Excuse me, Sally Sensitive, I don't remember asking you anything. Your mom's aware that she'll eventually have to stop the breast-feeding, right?
2908	Dr. Cox	Hoo! Good, Jordan, good! Now work the body, work the body! Under the ribs! Under the ribs!
2909	Jordan	I'm not gonna see that baby, either. Are you gonna tattle on me? Are ya? Are ya?I'm frightened!
2910	Elliot	J.D., do you have a second?
2911	J.D.	Oh, God, yes.
2912	Jordan	That's right run away, Sally.
2913	Elliot	I talked to a 9-1-1 operator who got a call from this young girl who was in labor, but they lost the signal. I don't know what to do.
2914	J.D.'s Narration	One of the worst things about this place is how often you feel like there's no one to turn to.
2915	Turk	You're okay, okay? You're gonna be okay.
2916	J.D.'s Narration	Babies are amazing. Especially the way they bring people together.
2917	Dr. Cox	So, Baby Charlie is the bald one?
2918	Jordan	Yeah. He wouldn't be smiling so much if he knew how ugly his parents were.
2919	Dr. Cox	You're a sexy bitch.
2920	Jordan	Thanks.
2921	J.D.'s Narration	I really think it's impossible to be unaffected.
2922	Turk	What up, little dawg!
2923	J.D.'s Narration	Because a baby can stir something deep down inside you you didn't even know was there.
2924	Elliot	Aw! Look at the baby!
2925	J.D.'s Narration	They can help you find something you thought you'd lost.
2926	Carla	How did you know she was here?
2927	Turk	I don't know I just knew!
2928	J.D.'s Narration	So, I guess Turk was right after all: Miracles do happen.I think you just have to be willing to look for them.
2929	Turk	Merry Christmas, guys.
2930	J.D.	God bless us, every one.
2931	Turk	Dude, you could not be a bigger dork.
2932	Elliot	You're so lame.
2933	Carla	That was so cheesy.
2934	J.D.	Really? 'Cause I felt like it was it was right?Hey, wait up!
2935	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2936	Janitor	HEY!
2937	J.D.	What?! I didn't say anything, I didn't do anything what imaginary slight have you concocted in that paranoid little brain of yours?
2938	J.D.'s Thoughts	Crap.
2939	J.D.	Well, shouldn't there be some sort of sign that say...Oh. Look at that. Well, you should put it back down before someone slips and falls.
2940	Janitor	Oh, is that what I should do. Good. Because I make most of my decisions based on your opinion.You know what, I'm thinking of splitting up with the wife maybe you could mull that one over, get back to me? We can powwow?The floor is wet, ma'am. Little help over here! Little help!
2941	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2942	Nurse Roberts	Move it or lose it, Q-Tip!
2943	Elliot	"Q-Tip"! 'Cause you're skinny and your head's fuzzy.
2944	J.D.	Something's going down.
2945	Dr. Cox	All right, bring it in here, you knuckle-heads. Come on, take a knee if you need to, you confound-its. I have been on since midnight so I stand here with my usual level of contempt for all of you, but with the added wrinkle of having thirteen cups of Nurse Roberts' piss-poor excuse for coffee passing pretty much straight through me. The not-so-hidden message being, of course, that if you screw up today, HA! I'm gonna hit ya hard! and HA! I'm gonna hit ya fast! Now then, I think some of you may have noticed that all twenty-seven of the patients that were here in the I.C.U. when I started last night are still alive; and I damn-sure intend for them to still be breathing when I get the hell out of here at midnight. I think you understand what kind of opportunity we have in front of us.
2946	Elliot	What opportunity?
2947	Doug	No; shush, shush.
2948	J.D.	Shut up!You see, in baseball, when a pitcher's really hot no one talks to him, no one looks at him, you just stay out of his way!
2949	Elliot	Why are you talking about baseball?
2950	Dr. Cox	Because you should never, _ever_ jinx a pitcher when he has a chance to throw a perfect game! My GOD, Barbie, how do you put your bra and panties on in the morning?! All by yourself! It's...remarkable!
2951	J.D.	See, 'cause he's the pitcher
2952	Elliot	Yeah, I get it now!
2953	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2954	J.D.'s Thoughts	Getting a chance to be a part of a perfect game is like a once in a lifetime opportunity it just never happens.Which is why I don't mind Dr. Cox paging me for the thirteenth time this last hour.
2955	J.D.'s Narration	You see, the I.C.U. is where all the most critical cases get turfed. So many patients die here, you start to think of death as just another co-worker always looking over your shoulder with the same annoying demands as every one else you work with.
2956	Death	DR. DORIAN. Listen, I know you're busy, but my daughter's selling cookies.
2957	J.D.	Put me down for two boxes of those mint thingies.
2958	Death	She's in second place in her troop; 'course, if that girl who's in first keeps doing as well as she's doing, we're just gonna take her!
2959	Dr. Cox	What, exactly, do you think you're gonna do, cash it in? In your face!You're fine; thank you. Barbie!
2960	Elliot	Whatever you need, Dr. Cox, I'm your girl!
2961	Dr. Cox	Peachy. Now get down to the pharmacy and get me thirty grams of Kayexalate and don't dilly-dally around trying to refill your prescription of Prozac, you're on my time now. Go, go, go.Nervous guy.
2962	Doug	Yessir!
2963	Nurse	Excuse me!
2964	Dr. Cox	Go down to Bed 18 and get me his tox-screen; and you better cross your fingers that the news is good, because if it's not I'm blaming you.And Newbie: I want you to start a drain on the purulent pericarditis in Bed 23 now that's a tricky bastard, he's tried to die five times on me already today. Keep an eye on him.
2965	J.D.	I'm your wing man, Maverick!I was watching, uh, 'Top Gun'. Did you know that Goose is actually the guy from 'E.R.'?
2966	Dr. Cox	No, I didn't! But but, please, keep talking!
2967	J.D.'s Narration	You really do have to keep an eye on things around here, 'cause just when it seems like everything's going great.......that's when the tiniest thing can throw it all out of whack.
2968	Turk	What are you doing? When the lunch-lady asked "French fries," you said no.
2969	Carla	Yeah...but I wanted french fries.
2970	Turk	So why didn't you _order_ fries?
2971	Carla	'Cause I can't _have_ french fries. Duh!
2972	Turk	Here. Have 'em all.
2973	Carla	Wha ?
2974	Turk	Have a fry salad.
2975	Carla	Tu what the? Turk? Baby, come on!

2978	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Dorian, I need a favor.
2979	J.D.	Actually, sir, I'm crazy-busy today.
2980	Dr. Kelso	Well, that's just fine, then, kiddo. I'm not going to be able to make the board meeting today I'm going to be tied up all afternoon at Dr. Dorian's pity party. Should I bring something? Maybe I could rent you a clown.
2981	J.D.	A drunk clown hurt me once.
2982	Dr. Kelso	Just listen to the damn lawyer. Go, Tom.
2983	Lawyer	Uh, it's Ted, but hey, it's only been twelve years. This morning, one of the social workers that covers this hospital slipped and knocked herself unconscious; we're concerned she might turn around and sue us. If that happens, some of the higher-ups' heads could roll!
2984	Dr. Kelso	The point is that people are less likely to sue an institution if we can put a friendly face on it. You've got a friendly face.
2985	J.D.	But, sir, I
2986	Dr. Kelso	Sacred Heart is calling for your help, sport. Will you accept the call? 'Berring!'
2987	Lawyer	Oh! Uh... 'Ber' uh 'berring'.
2988	Dr. Kelso	By the way, this is a special phone if you don't answer it, you get to be the intern who does the physicals over at the state prison!

3001	Carla	There ya go be proud of who you are.
3002	Mike	You wear too much mascara.
3003	Carla	You be careful, now.
3004	Turk	Hey.
3005	Carla	What are you doing here?
3006	Turk	Cross-covering the day for a buddy of mine, I know
3007	Carla	Whatever. Thirty-six-year-old male, possible dislocated shoulder.
3008	Turk	All right. So, how are you doing?
3009	Mike	Well, it just got so cold in here, I think the swelling may have gone down. Brrrrr ow!
3010	Turk	Yeah, I hope that hurts.

3012	Doug	Oh, no; no, no, no.
3013	Dr. Cox	Is this the tox-screen? Oh, Dougie, this does _not_ bode well for you.
3014	Doug	I know.
3015	Dr. Cox	I'll tell you what: Second chance you go get the results of Mr. Churbin's unrinalysis; but if the numbers aren't good, I'm gonna take one of your kidneys and give it to him.Ten bucks says I can make that kid wet himself before the day is over.
3016	Nurse Roberts	Oh, everybody's afraid of Mr. Man!
3017	Dr. Cox	Laverne, you give good sass!
3018	Elliot	Dr. Cox! I got the Kayexalate _and_ I pulled all the x-rays you asked for, so I am yours for the night do whatever you want with me. Oh! My God! Um, that totally came out wrong! I just I meant that I want you to use me, and I don't care how degrading it is.
3019	Dr. Cox	What?
3020	Elliot	No...no! No, it's just that I know you like torturing people, and I am totally up for that. I just want to make you happy!
3021	Nurse Roberts	Marshmallow, hush.
3022	Dr. Cox	This guy needs a lumbar puncture, and I need an extra set of hands. Get over here.
3023	Elliot	Ready and rearing!
3024	Dr. Cox	Not you. Ginger, get the lead out! Come on.
3025	J.D.	Excuse me.
3026	Dr. Cox	It puts the lotion on the skin.
3027	J.D.	Oh, so you can do movies and I can't.
3028	Dr. Cox	It puts the damn iodine lotion on the skin gimme a break!
3029	Nurse Roberts	Mr. Man!
3030	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3031	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Dorian, I owe you an apology. Obviously I was unclear when I said, "Stay in the M.R.I. room with that patient." It must have sounded like, "Leave, and do other things."Let me rephrase it so there'll be no more confusion: Get your ass back down there!
3032	Alex	You have no idea how loud that is in here!
3033	J.D.	Oh, I'm sorry. The good news is you'll be done in a second.
3034	Alex	Was that a good sound?!
3035	J.D.	Not that good a sound.
3036	Alex	Oh, my God! Is it stuck!?
3037	J.D.	Well, stuck is such a literal term. It's more like, not moving.
3038	Alex	Well, pull me the hell out of here!
3039	J.D.	I can't; you were knocked unconscious, you could have a serious head injury. Just be glad you're not claustrophobic.
3040	Alex	Promise you won't leave me.
3041	J.D.	I promise.Dr. Cox must have my pager on speed dial. He's completely on top of me today.
3042	Elliot	Oh, do you know how much I wish Dr. Cox was on top of me?
3043	J.D.	That's naughty!
3044	Elliot	You make me so mad, I might actually scream! Every day you bitch and you bitch about how hard Dr. Cox is on you, and you don't even realize that you're his go-to guy.
3045	J.D.	Oh, come on, you're over-reacting a little bit.
3046	Elliot	What has he had you do today? Hm?
3047	J.D.	Ummm.... He had me intubate and extubate Mrs. Pollard; float a Swan on Mr. Caulca; and then do two thoracenteses, a paracentesis, a radial art. line...oh, and then place a transvenous pacemaker for a complete heart-block. Why? What did you do?
3048	Elliot	Oh, uh....Cream. No sugar.
3049	J.D.	He takes it sugar, no cream.
3050	Mike	My arm is breaking! My arm is breaking! Please!
3051	Turk	Okay! Okay! Okay. Okay, it's not going in.
3052	Mike	Really! Why don't we try kicking it?
3053	Turk	I'm gonna go talk to one of the orthopedics.
3054	Mike	Hurry back. God! That guy is the worst!
3055	Carla	Oh, be nice. He's my boyfriend.
3056	Mike	Not for long.
3057	Carla	Excuse me?
3058	Mike	Please! He's been dying to run out of here since the second he came in.
3059	Carla	Oh, he did not _run_ out of here.
3060	Mike	Oh, okay, I'm sorry, you're right it wasn't running, it was, uh, fleeing, like he was being chased by a swarm of killer bees.
3061	Turk	Okay, he said just keep pulling.

3068	Alex	You're such a nice guy.
3069	J.D.'s Thoughts	Whoa.... It really feels like there's something going on, here. I wonder what she looks like?
3070	Jimmie Walker	Why am I always in your fantasies!? You got a problem, man!
3071	J.D.	Why are you squeezing all my fingers?

3082	J.D.'s Narration	Sure, I was probably thinking a little bit about the M.R.I. girl, but I also like to believe that, perfect game or not, giving a friend the chance to shine was just as important to me.
3083	J.D.	Sir, it's, uh, Dr. Kelso he's making me baby-sit this patient downstairs.
3084	Dr. Cox	Newbie! It's the bottom of the ninth if you're not gonna be my catcher, just exactly who is?Oh, no.

3091	Elliot	Okay! I was eighth but I can do this! I'll get us this perfect
3092	Dr. Cox	Don't say it!
3093	Elliot	...The perfect game!
3094	Dr. Cox	No, don't say ! What part of "don't say it" did you not understand? Was is the "don't"? Or was it the "say it"? Help me to help you, Barbie. Help me to help you; help me to help you; help me to help you.
3095	Elliot	I, um...should get to work.
3096	Dr. Cox	That would be lovely.
3097	Elliot	Mm-hmm.
3098	Dr. Cox	Wow!
3099	J.D.	Hey, Elliot, do you
3100	Elliot	No time!
3101	J.D.'s Thoughts	We all have important things to do.
3102	J.D.	Hey, do you know what Alex Hanson looks like?
3103	Doug	He's okay.
3104	Nurse Roberts	I don't know. I don't look at the ladies.
3105	Dr. Kelso	Young man, I've been married for over three decades. I would've gone there, though; oh, yes, I would've.
3106	Janitor	Who cares? No one'll ever love you.
3107	Lawyer	I don't find her pretty; but since my wife left, when I look at a woman, I find it hard to see past the evil. Heh.
3108	Carla	I know something's wrong.
3109	Turk	Nothing's wrong.
3110	Carla	You always say nothing's wrong, then you sulk for a week and then you finally tell me.
3111	Turk	First of all, we haven't known each other long enough for me to "always" be doing anything.
3112	Mike	Well, I've only known you for ten minutes, and you're always hurting me.
3113	Carla	Oh, so now you're getting defensive?
3114	Turk	Woman, I am _not_ defensive.
3115	Mike	Yeah, y'are, a little bit.
3116	Carla	Turk, we're stuck here, why don't you just take a deep breath and tell me what's wrong?

3120	Dr. Cox	Barbie, plates are wobbling everywhere.

3122	Dr. Cox	Or, you could transfuse him.
3123	Elliot	Okay, I'll do that.
3124	Dr. Cox	Although, transfusions are riskier.
3125	Elliot	Which is why my first instinct was to do pressers.
3126	Dr. Cox	You know what they say about your first instincts.
3127	Elliot	Yeah: You should always stick with them. Shouldn't you?
3128	Dr. Cox	Should you?
3129	Elliot	Should I?
3130	Dr. Cox	"Should I?" You'll have plenty of time to think about it on the bench, because that's where you're headed. Now go. Gimme this, precious. Get outta here. Go ahead. Go, go.Hippity-hop to the barber shop."Should I?"

3134	Carla	Well, why don't you look into your heart and see how it feels?
3135	J.D.	My heart hates uggos.
3136	Carla	You know what, that's exactly what's wrong with you men. You're all so superficial, so afraid of what you really feel. I'm so sick of it!
3137	J.D.	So, do you know what she looks like?

3144	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Dorian! Why don't you take Miss Hanson out for a lovely dinner?

3163	J.D.	What the hell is going on, here?
3164	Elliot	It's like, I say one thing, he says the other. I seriously can't take it anymore.
3165	J.D.	Fine, why don't you just quit, become a lesbian, and hook up with some hot model?
3166	Elliot	What does that have to do with anything?
3167	J.D.	I don't know...I just thought it'd be hot. Elliot, he's testing you. If you ever want Cox to respect you, you can't be afraid to disagree with him.
3168	Elliot	You're afraid.
3169	J.D.	But I still do it. Get back in the game, Elliot.
3170	Dr. Cox	Ah! Dammit!Dammit! Dammit! So close! DAMMIT!I'm sorry. I'm fine.Perfect game! ...Call it.
3171	Elliot	Just five minutes left, and it's just the two of us here! Couldn't we just...wait?
3172	Dr. Cox	Just...call it.
3173	Elliot	No. We all need this, so no. I won't call it.
3174	Dr. Cox	You know, that's probably the dumbest thing anybody's said to me around here in a long time. There's nothing wrong with a one-hitter, there, Barbie. In fact, it's miraculous. And I won't have you of all people cheapen what should be an endless pursuit of perfection just because you want the world to laugh with you tonight. Now, call it.

3183	Carla	You said strong women turn you on!
3184	Turk	Forget about it.
3185	Carla	Look, we all know what you're gonna do, so why not be a man and do it so I can go home?
3186	Turk	Okay.I love you. You annoy me more than I ever thought possible, but...I want to spend every irritating minute with you.
3187	Carla	Me too.
3188	Turk	Yeah.
3189	Carla	I love you.

3194	Elliot	Yeah.
3195	Dr. Cox	Good girl. Up on the second floor, holy cow, there's a laundry list of stuff I want you to do....
3196	J.D.'s Narration	...And how it's really just about overcoming your fears. Because the truth is, every time you take a big risk in your life, no matter how it ends up, you're always glad you took it.

3219	Dr. Cox	Here's the deal: I have been coerced by the forces of evil into conducting rounds this morning.
3220	Dr. Kelso	Why do you have to do rounds? Because I'm sleeping. How's that?
3221	Dr. Cox	So, in order to make this a more palatable experience for moi, I am not going to call you by your names instead, I'll be referring to you by whatever distinguishing physical characteristic occurs to me first. Okay...you, Chicken Beak : What causes pneumonia presenting with diarrhea?
3222	Dr. Simotas	Legionella.
3223	Dr. Cox	Nice job! It turns out your mind's just as sharp as your nose. Whoo! And you, Dye Job:What are the elements of Whipple's Triad?
3224	Elliot	Uhh....
3225	J.D.'s Narration	It's hard to describe how scary it is when you don't know an answer at rounds.
3226	Elliot	I can't remember. I am so sorry.
3227	Dr. Cox	Sorry? What in the hell are you sorry about?
3228	Elliot	Well, it's just, Dr. Kelso always yells at us when we don't know the answer, and
3229	Dr. Cox	Oh, children, you can't let that bloated bag of hate affect you like that! And, besides, being a doctor is as much about finding the answers as it is about knowing them. For instance, take Clara Belle's patient, here, Mr. Yeager. Now, we have no idea what in the hell's wrong with him, so we have run tests for everything from Meningitis to Intracranial Mass. And according to these results oh! everything seems to have come back negative.Which doesn't necessarily mean that Clara Belle, here, is a failure it doesn't. It just means that she's got to keep trying, no matter how frustrated she just might get. Now, 'course, if you are lazy and incompetent, then, yes, that will buy you a one-way ticket out of here. Doug.Uh-huh. Listen to me carefully: Kelso can't do a damn thing to you if you just answer a question wrong. It doesn't work that way. Moving on.Not you you still have work to do.Johnny No-Tan?
3230	Doug	Yes, sir?
3231	Dr. Cox	I'd like you to present the next patient to me.
3232	Turk	I love you.
3233	Carla	Mmm. Now say it in Spanish.
3234	Turk	Te amo.
3235	Carla	Now...say it like Astro.
3236	Turk	I ruv roo.
3237	Carla	You are very, very cute.
3238	Turk	Yeah, I know. You know, I've been thinking about this whole "I love you" thing?
3239	Carla	Mmm?
3240	Turk	It's gonna make everything so much better. I mean, we're so in sync. Better conversation...better dancing....

3255	J.D.	Hi!You know what's great about you working in the hospital?
3256	Alex	Hm?
3257	J.D.	Like, even when our dates get interrupted, we can just have a date here. Yeah, like, let's say for instance you wanted to watch a movie we could just go to the conference room and watch that video on S.T.D.s. It's funny, and it makes you think!
3258	Alex	Look, maybe it would be good if we actually had a date that...ends.
3259	J.D.	Well, how does a date with you end?
3260	Alex	It can range from a kiss at the door to...all I have for breakfast is yogurt, and I'm out of bowls, so you'll have to eat off my stomach.
3261	J.D.	Tonight. Dinner. Hyde's.
3262	Alex	It's a date.

3264	J.D.	So, judging from the ataxia dysarthia and the mental status change, I've concluded that Mr. Yeager is suffering from...Kuru.
3265	Dr. Cox	Kuru?
3266	J.D.	Kuru.
3267	Dr. Cox	Kuru.
3268	J.D.	Yes, Kuru.
3269	Dr. Cox	Wow. I'd actually never thought of that.
3270	J.D.	Hell, yeah.
3271	Dr. Cox	Were you aware that the only documented cases of Kuru were members of a cannibalistic tribe in eastern Papua New Guinea?
3272	J.D.	I was not.
3273	Mr. Yeager	Actually, Doc, I was in New Guinea just last week.
3274	J.D.	Really?
3275	Mr. Yeager	No.
3276	Dr. Cox	Newbie, do you happen to know what a zebra is?
3277	J.D.	That patient just mocked me!
3278	Dr. Cox	It's a diagnosis of a ridiculously obscure disease when it's much more likely that the patient has a common illness presenting with uncommon symptoms. In other words, if you hear hoof-beats, you just go ahead and think horsies not zebras. Mm'kay, Mr. Silly Bear?
3279	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3280	Elliot	What's wrong?
3281	Carla	It's personal.

3283	Carla	It's a sex thing, okay?
3284	Elliot	You mean like a gender issue or like intercourse? Because I'm book-smart on both!Carla! Use me.
3285	Turk	So, last night, when I was with Carla....
3286	J.D.	Dude, I'm sorry I can't talk right now. I really gotta figure this Mr. Yeager thing out.
3287	Turk	Cool. Cool.
3288	J.D.	Okay.
3289	Turk	Let's just say my horse didn't finish the race. I mean, I'm at the filling station but my credit card gets declined. I'm on the jet ski
3290	J.D.	I got it!
3291	Turk	Good, 'cause I had no idea what I was gonna say after that one.

3296	J.D.'s Narration	Afternoon rounds that day began like any other.
3297	Dr. Kelso	This patient is hypoglycemic; what would be the most telling sign of an insulinoma, Dr. Reid?
3298	Elliot	Uh, elevated fasting C-peptide levels.
3299	Dr. Kelso	Score! But before you do your crazy end-zone dance, can you tell me the spinal fluid findings in Guillain-Barré Syndrome?
3300	Elliot	Uhh, Xanthochromia?
3301	Dr. Kelso	Wrong!
3302	J.D.'s Narration	And then it happened: Suddenly, Dr. Kelso didn't seem as frightening.
3303	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Reid, what do you have to say for yourself?
3304	Elliot	Win some, lose some.
3305	J.D.'s Narration	In fact, nothing he did seemed to scare us.

3315	Elliot	Talk to me.... Talk to me....
3316	Carla	You know, that's really getting annoying. In fact, every time you say it, it makes me not want to talk to you all the more.
3317	Elliot	Talk to me....
3318	Carla	All right! Fine! Last night, Turk and I were...you know, messing around?
3319	Turk	...It's really hot, like always.
3320	Todd	Well, hot like how? Describe it.
3321	Turk	Dude! So, suddenly, things aren't happening. Know what I mean?
3322	Carla	I don't understand it; the only thing that's changed is that we said "I love you" to each other.
3323	Turk	Okay, it's true, I have never said "I love you" to a woman before.
3324	Todd	Well, then, how do you get them to sleep with you?
3325	Carla	It's three little words, it shouldn't have this effect, right? Anyway, I told him it wasn't his fault these things happen occasionally
3326	Elliot	Try "constantly"!Um...well, I have cold hands....
3327	Todd	So, when I saw you in the hall this morning, and I said, "How's your penis?" and you didn't want to talk about it....
3328	Turk	Dude. It's not me.
3329	Carla	It's _me_. Last night, for the first time ever in our relationship, no matter how long we tried, I was unable to have an....a....uh....
3330	Elliot	Oh!
3331	Carla	Yeah.
3332	Elliot	Ohhh.

3334	J.D.	Dr. Cox. I got the sed-rate back on Mr. Yeager. Say how-do to that.
3335	Dr. Cox	All righty. But then I'm due back at the hootenanny.
3336	J.D.	See, I noticed he had a rash on his legs, right? And then I realized he's been having jaw claudication, which led me to....
3337	Dr. Cox	Temporal Arteritis. Of course it is. Nurse?Will you start Mr. Yeager on high-dose Solumedrol and get the surgery resident he needs a temporal artery biopsy, stat.Now, Newbie, I'm relatively certain I can handle this. You're off anyway, aren't you?
3338	J.D.	Yeah, whatever. I'm with you.
3339	Dr. Cox	Fair enough. Let's go treat the patient.
3340	J.D.'s Thoughts	I am so on top of things tonight, it's scary.
3341	J.D.	Hell yeah.
3342	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3343	J.D.'s Thoughts	You're only eighty minutes late. She'll still be here. Please be here!Come on, Alex, please be here. Please be here. Please
3344	Janitor	You gotta be kidding me!There's a waste of a gift certificate! Cancel the cobbler!
3345	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3346	Turk	She's not having an orgasm.
3347	Todd	Still not seeing what the problem is.
3348	Elliot	I, um...I've never even had an orgasm.
3349	Carla	Mm.Oh! I'm sorry I should be more surprised.
3350	Elliot	Yeah, that that'd be nice.
3351	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3352	Dr. Kelso	I want to talk to you about rounds.
3353	Dr. Cox	Well, here we go, Bobby. Bring it on.
3354	Dr. Kelso	They're all yours. You will be leading them from now on.
3355	Dr. Cox	You've stunned me, but you haven't dropped me to the mat. I'm kinda waiting for the roundhouse, here, the old hay-maker.......when when the yelling starts and the voice gets high-pi Daddy, I've been bad! Daddy, I've been a bad boy!Oh, Daddy! Oh, Daddy! Daddy, I've been bad!Oh, come on, if you're not gonna play there's no fun!
3356	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3357	J.D.	Hey, uh, Alex, I am so sorry; but I went to the restaurant, I guess I just missed you. And then I-I called your house, but there was no answer. And then I actually stopped by your house, and I guess you didn't see me which was sort of odd, 'cause I was standing next to the pizza guy while you were paying him, but I, uh.... We're still...cool, right?
3358	Alex	Look, J.D., um
3359	J.D.	"Look, J.D., we're still great," right?
3360	Alex	I-I think you're a really good guy, okay, but....
3361	J.D.	Alex dumped me.
3362	Dr. Cox	Aw, you mean the blind girl you've been dating?
3363	J.D.	She's not blind.
3364	Dr. Cox	Of course she's not. Okay, Newbie, how'd you drop the ball on this one? And don't tell me you cried, or I'm gonna have you banned from the men's room again.
3365	J.D.	Well, I was just so excited about what we were doing here last night, I just forgot all about our date.
3366	Dr. Cox	You didn't forget. You kept looking at your watch. I saw you.I just naturally assumed that you were just afraid of missing 'Judging Amy' it never occurred to me that you were choosing work over being with that sweet little biscuit, you stupid piss-ant.
3367	J.D.	Well, you know what? That that means a lot coming from you, Mr. Right Here With Me Two Hours After His Shift, Also...And Last Monday Night, Too...Guy.
3368	Dr. Cox	What?
3369	J.D.	You heard me.
3370	Dr. Cox	Newbie, what are you saying? That you want to be like me? Do you understand that...I just barely want to be like me?
3371	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3372	Elliot	Listen, Carla, I can't even pretend that I can give you tips on intercourse....
3373	Carla	I got one for you stop calling it that.
3374	Elliot	My therapist thinks my trouble in bed stems from a basic fear of intimacy. But I just think it's just because any type of repetitive motion makes me nauseous. Oh, and since I was a little kid, I've always had nightmares about being crushed.
3375	Carla	That poor shrink.
3376	Elliot	Yeah.... The one thing I do know is that I've sabotaged a lot of relationships by never talking things out with the guy that I'm seeing.
3377	Carla	Thanks.
3378	Elliot	Sure.
3379	Carla	Hey!So...you've _really_ never had....?
3380	Elliot	Nope.
3381	Carla	Not even by yourself?
3382	Elliot	Gross! Uhh.... Is it easy?
3383	Carla	When's your next laundry night?
3384	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3385	Dr. Kelso	Ted. I need you to take care of some lawyer crap for me, and it would be a great help if you would go to traffic court for me and make this go away.
3386	Lawyer	I...don't think so.
3387	Dr. Kelso	Excuse me?
3388	Lawyer	No, Bob. I have my own things I need to take care of.
3389	Dr. Kelso	Of course. Of course....
3390	Lawyer	Walk off, bitch.
3391	Dr. Cox	How is it, exactly, that _you_ just said that and your pants are still dry?
3392	Lawyer	Don't you understand what you did when you spoke to those interns? You took away the fear. You...are a wonderful person. And...I love you.
3393	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3394	J.D.'s Thoughts	I have to ask Alex for another chance. I have to.Okay, she's with a very hot guy. Stay calm, she's gonna be psyched to see you.
3395	Alex	J.D. Hey.
3396	J.D.'s Thoughts	Or not....
3397	J.D.	You were right, I don't prioritize you over my job, but I'd like to. Look, Alex, I wanted to be a doctor for so long, I sort of forgot how to want anything else. And now I meet you and I Look, all I'm trying to say is, I'll do anything in the world if you give me a second chance.
3398	Alex	I'm sorry.
3399	J.D.	Okay. I'll leave you guys alone.
3400	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3401	Turk	Okay, Rowdy.... Fetch!
3402	Carla	Hey, Sweetie!
3403	Turk	Hey!
3404	Carla	We have to talk.
3405	Turk	No time for talk we have a specific problem, and we need to take care of it.
3406	Carla	Why are you wearing one of those nose breathing thingies?
3407	Turk	Baby, bear with me I got big ideas.
3408	Carla	Look, I've been having all these thoughts going through my head, and I'm afraid that if I tell you I would scare you away; that's the last thing that I want to Just take that damn thing off!Oh, God.
3409	Turk	Baby, there's nothing that could scare me away.
3410	Carla	Ever since we said "I love you" to each other, I've been feeling all this pressure, and wondering about the future our future. Like, are we gonna get married? Are we gonna have kids? If so, how many, and when will I get my figure back? Should I keep working? Where're we gonna live? Is my mother gonna live with us? How big a house do we need? How many bathrooms? What if my mother walks in on you while you're in the bathroom, you slip and fall, and I can't afford the funeral costs?
3411	Turk	Okay, that's a little scary.
3412	Carla	I guess...I just need to know you think about that stuff, too.
3413	Turk	Carla! Oh........No, I don't.
3414	Carla	Oh.
3415	Turk	But I love it that you do.
3416	Carla	Yeah?
3417	Turk	Yeah. I think that's what makes this relationship work; we're so different. I keep us in the present, and you look out for what's up ahead.Besides, there is no way in hell your mother is ever going to live with us.I'm serious, if she ever walks in on me while I'm in the bathroom, I guarantee you: she's getting a trip to Florida.
3418	Carla	No she's not!
3419	Turk	I'm telling you hey, ow, ow she's going to a home!
3420	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3421	Dr. Cox	Now, ladies and germs, I guarantee you that if you get this shorthand down, it has a way of making your day go just a little bit quicker. "C.T.D." of course being "circling the drain" your patient is on the way out. "S.O.B." "shortness of breath"; and "W.N.L." "within normal limits." Elvis, you go ahead and feel free to write this down anytime you want before you leave the building, sweetheart.
3422	Dr. Kelso	You paged me?
3423	Dr. Cox	I didn't page you.
3424	J.D.'s Narration	And that's when Dr. Cox started poking the old bear with a stick.
3425	Dr. Cox	You know what, I'm sick of the old grill-'em-and-drill-'em. What do you say we shake things up a littler bit, here? You kids ask me the questions, and I'll just give you the answers; whatta you say?
3426	Dr. Kelso	Uh, Dr. Cox, could I talk to you?
3427	Dr. Cox	Well, sure you can, Bob, but you're gonna have to go ahead and raise your hand like all the other children.
3428	Dr. Kelso	I I just think it's inappropriate
3429	Dr. Cox	Bobbo, now, you've got five good ones right there. Whatta you say you put 'em up in the air like you just don't care.
3430	Dr. Kelso	Get over here. Right now!
3431	J.D.'s Narration	Maybe he felt sorry for Kelso and didn't want to take away the one thing the guy had.
3432	Dr. Kelso	How on earth are they ever going to learn anything....
3433	J.D.'s Narration	...maybe he just hated rounds, I don't know.
3434	Dr. Kelso	...ridiculous! Now get the hell out of my I.C.U! I'm taking over!
3435	J.D.'s Narration	But if you didn't know Dr. Cox like I did, you'd have believed his performance, too.I guess the key to a lot of things is balance. Whether it's balance of power...
3436	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Simotas, stop smiling!I hate smiling.
3437	J.D.'s Narration	...balance in love......or sometimes just balance.For some of us, it seems too far out of reach......too difficult to achieve.....But the important thing is just to never stop trying......especially if you like girls named Alex...and chicken salad.
3438	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3439	J.D.'s Narration	When you're really crazy about someone, even waking up isn't so bad anymore.
3440	J.D.	Mmm. Good morning.
3441	J.D.'s Narration	The air feels crisper, the sun seems brighter...even your morning breath smells good.
3442	Alex	You taste like old eggs.
3443	J.D.	Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
3444	Alex	I love old eggs.You are so different from the guys I usually go out with.
3445	J.D.	How so?
3446	Alex	Well, for starters......I'm still wearing pants.
3447	J.D.	Yeah, well, that is because I respect you.
3448	Alex	Oh, yeah?
3449	J.D.	Yeah. And also, this triple-knot, I couldn't get out.Argh!
3450	Alex	Hey, thanks for being so patient with me. I hope you don't think I'm a big tease. I just...I love sleeping in the same bed with you. I've never slept better, you know?
3451	J.D.	Me neither.
3452	Alex	Mm.
3453	J.D.	You know, in fact, I'll go ahead and say it: I hope we never have sex.
3454	Alex	What would you say...if I told you I feel ready right now.
3455	J.D.	Whatever....
3456	Alex	Oh, okay, then I think tonight, we should get a nice bottle of wine
3457	J.D.	Yeah, tonight is good, but I think now also good.
3458	Alex	Yeah, now works...sure.
3459	Turk	Now that's what I'm talkin' 'bout!

3463	J.D.'s Narration	Since Alex is a social worker, she's here a lot. For some guys, that would be distracting, but I'm staying focused.

3465	J.D.	Oh, God! I'm so sorry! I'm sorry.
3466	Janitor	Whoa. No, please! Step on my foot! I'm just waiting for an excuse.
3467	J.D.	Not today.
3468	Janitor	Really? Why not?Ahh. I get it.
3469	J.D.	Yeah.
3470	Janitor	Nice pull.
3471	J.D.	Thanks.
3472	Janitor	You slept with her yet?
3473	J.D.	What? I I am not discussing that with you!
3474	Janitor	That's a no.
3475	J.D.	Listen, Jolly Green: people's personal lives are just that they're personal.
3476	Janitor	That's a definite no.

3478	Dr. Cox	It's good to see you again, Mr. Barnes; we'll be with you in a moment.
3479	Nurse Roberts	Put him in Bed 6.
3480	Dr. Cox	Tell me, Laverne, are you in fact part golden retriever?
3481	Nurse Roberts	Keep it holy, now.
3482	Dr. Cox	I only ask because, every time I toss this guy, you bring him right back to me.All right, Will and Grace: break down.
3483	Elliot	Judging by Mr. Barnes' elevated lipase, I'd say it's pancreatitis.
3484	Dr. Cox	Okay, Grace, you wanna finish?
3485	J.D.	I'd start him on a Demerol drip and
3486	Dr. Cox	Ohhh, the throbbing's back.
3487	Elliot	Mr. Barnes has been admitted for substance abuse three times in the past year.
3488	J.D.	Yeah, but he said he quit.
3489	Dr. Cox	Oh! The addict said he quit? Why wouldn't you tell me something like that? 'Cause, don't you see, that changes everything.
3490	J.D.	I believe in Mr. Barnes.
3491	Dr. Cox	Lookit, Newbie: Just because you have a new girlfriend doesn't mean that the world has suddenly turned in to a giant green M&M. The Red Sox still suck, they do; Barbie, here, still can't decide what to do with those annoying bangs.......And addicts everywhere will still lie, cheat, and steal just to get a fix....Now, you've got to wake up, Sweetheart, you're gonna be late for school Aw, you wet the bed! Why can't I have a normal child without these problems?!
3492	Elliot	My mom says they frame my face!

3503	Carla	Dr. Cox and I have been friends for a long time. You should get to know him.
3504	Turk	Do I have to?
3505	Carla	Yeah, you have to.
3506	Dr. Cox	In case you were wondering, it says, "If you can read this, you're standing too close."
3507	Turk	No, I wasn't trying to...you know...look....
3508	Dr. Cox	Now let's see if you can tinkle when someone's staring at you.Yeah, go ahead and take your time I actually have all day.
3509	Turk	Come on....
3510	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3511	Alex	Now, I've been Mr. Barnes' case worker for a long time; he just needs everyone to cut him some slack, you know?
3512	J.D.	Yeah. Hey, let me get this door for you.
3513	Alex	Okay.I mean, people just don't understand addiction.... Why are we in the on-call room?Ah.So, have you, uh, ever fooled around in here?
3514	J.D.	Yeah, lots of times.... Never _with_ anyone, but....
3515	Alex	Would you like to change that?
3516	J.D.	Yes, please!Oh...hey.... Hey, Elliot...um...can you come back in, like, two minutes?
3517	Alex	Hm?
3518	J.D.	...Or, like, eighty minutes?
3519	Elliot	I just wanted to tell you the nurses just did a check of the narcotics drawer, and there's 50 Percocet missing.
3520	J.D.	What we should do is split up into teams and search every room. We'll take this one.
3521	Elliot	Fine.
3522	Alex	You know they're gonna go right to Mr. Barnes; I'm gonna go check on him, okay?
3523	J.D.	Uh, Alex?
3524	Alex	Hm? What?
3525	J.D.	I just don't like it when you leave.
3526	Alex	Come here.Tonight, we'll pick up right where we left off.

3529	Vendor	Hey, Bob, how are ya?
3530	Dr. Kelso	Fine, Allen. Uh, today, I think I'll try a double half-caf mocha foam latte mochaccino with a shot of vanilla and a sprinkle of nutmeg.
3531	Vendor	So, black coffee?
3532	Dr. Kelso	Bingo-bango!
3533	Carla	Oh, my God these people actually like you!
3534	Dr. Kelso	Maybe you should just order.
3535	Carla	Yes, I'll have an espresso, please; and...what kind of scones do you have today?
3536	Rude Man	Son of a bitch. Do you mind, lady? I am in a rush.
3537	Carla	Oh, my goodness! I'm so sorry. What am I doing thinking I can take an extra six seconds to pick my breakfast? I'm gonna have to call my mom and tell her she did a lousy job raising me. Thank you, so much.
3538	Dr. Kelso	I, uh, I think what she means is, she doesn't give a crappuccino!Allen, this is on me. God help me, I love spunk!
3539	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3540	Turk	Hey. How you doing?
3541	Dr. Cox	Oh, hey! How are you? Can I buy you a beer? This is a men's room, for God's sake there is absolutely no talking in here. Ever.
3542	Turk	It's just so freaky, you know? We're on the same pee schedule.
3543	Dr. Cox	No we're not. No we're not! No, no.
3544	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3545	J.D.'s Thoughts	This is not good.
3546	Alex	Why would you assume Mr. Barnes stole the Percocet? There's lots of people on that ward.
3547	J.D.	That's a good point.
3548	Elliot	Yeah, and three of them are in comas, two others can't walk, and one's a nun.
3549	J.D.	Also a very valid point.
3550	Alex	Look, Elliot, I'm sure Mr. Barnes didn't take the drugs he has been in rehab for over six months!
3551	Elliot	Mmm?
3552	Alex	There's no reason to be so judgmental.
3553	Elliot	I am _not_ judgmental. If I were, I'd tell you your shoes are ugly.
3554	J.D.	Do _not_ stoop to her level.
3555	Alex	Your bangs make you look like a chipmunk.
3556	Elliot	It's a _frame_. Why can nobody see that!?
3557	J.D.	Can we get back to the matter at hand? This is about Mr. Barnes.
3558	Alex	Fine. So who do you think's right?
3559	Elliot	Yeah?
3560	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, crap.
3561	Turk	Hey.
3562	Dr. Cox	Oh, for the love of Oprah! Why, why, _why_ would you come to Pediatrics!?
3563	Turk	'Cause I can't go unless you're around. You're my little pee buddy!
3564	Dr. Cox	Whatta you say we cut to the chase? You're dating Carla, the one person in this hospital I can remotely stand, and she wants us to get all kissy-face with each other I get it, I do. But, you see, every single time I shake my magic 8 ball and ask it, "Are we gonna be best friends forever?" do you know what it says?
3565	Turk	No.
3566	Dr. Cox	"Outlook is buh-leak."
3567	Turk	Well, Dr. Cox, you really can't trust those things. I mean, when I was nine, I asked mine if I should crack it open and drink the fluid inside; I puked blue for, like, three days!
3568	Dr. Cox	Just a real cute story. Here's what you're gonna do: Go back to Carla, and don't obsess about why she's with you in the first place. Just...tell her we went to a ball game and we borrowed each other's sweaters. Nn'kay, little buddy?
3569	Turk	What?
3570	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3571	Nurse Roberts	Well, I don't think we should stand for it. Dr. Kelso can't just decide we're not allowed to switch shifts anymore. I'm supposed to go see my nephew tonight in 'Pippin.'
3572	Nurse	Who's he playing?
3573	Nurse Roberts	Pippin. Bob Kelso is a bad man.
3574	Carla	I don't know; I mean, we never think about how hard it is to always be the bad guy, you know?
3575	Nurse Roberts	I want him to die!Hello, Sweetness!
3576	Dr. Kelso	Ladies. Carla, I was thinking about what you said this morning about your mother's birthday, and I don't want her spending it alone, so I've arranged for you to swap shifts with the nurse on the third floor.
3577	Carla	Oh, Dr. Kelso....
3578	Dr. Kelso	Don't mention it! And, should I pick you up tomorrow morning at the same place?
3579	Carla	Ummm.....
3580	Dr. Kelso	Great! Goodbye, all you smiling faces!
3581	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3582	Turk	So, who'd you side with, Elliot or Alex?
3583	J.D.	Neither; I just pretended I was paged, and then when they said they didn't hear anything, I called them both liars and ran away.
3584	Turk	Smooth.
3585	J.D.	Yeah. It's just, you know, they both have a point
3586	Turk	Stick to the booty principle.
3587	J.D.	What's that?
3588	Turk	The booty principle: Which one do you want to sleep with?
3589	J.D.	Alex.
3590	Turk	Then I think _she_ might be right.
3591	J.D.'s Thoughts	I'm not sure about Turk's advice; I mean, sometimes he oversimplifies things especially when it comes to booty.
3592	Alex	What would you say if I told you I feel ready right...now.
3593	J.D.	I agree with Alex. Yeah, I've been thinking about it a lot, and I think that, you know, she's right about Mr. Barnes we can't we can't just jump to conclusions.
3594	Elliot	Oh, I am _so_ surprised.
3595	J.D.	Hey, tell me something: What do what do you think about Alex?
3596	Elliot	No way! I am not saying anything about a girl that you're sleeping with!
3597	Janitor	He's not sleeping with her.
3598	J.D.	I'm serious. Look, no ramifications, nothing, just tell me what you think
3599	Elliot	I don't like her; I don't trust her, and I'm afraid that she's gonna hurt you.
3600	J.D.	You're jealous!
3601	Elliot	Shut up!
3602	J.D.	So, "Shut up" because you're so jealous of her...that you don't even care that I'm happy for once.
3603	Elliot	Do you honestly believe that's what's going on here?
3604	J.D.'s Thoughts	Do not, under any circumstances, say what you're thinking.
3605	J.D.	I'm sorry, but you had your chance with me.
3606	J.D.'s Thoughts	Why don't I ever listen to me?
3607	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3608	J.D.'s Thoughts	You know what, don't worry about yesterday; Elliot's not the type of girl that holds a grudge.Then again....
3609	Carla	You see, I think that you should tell your neighbor that you will hang your hammock wherever you damn well please, and if she doesn't like it she can just move!
3610	Dr. Kelso	That's what I like about you, Carla! You don't give a rat's ass what anybody thinks!
3611	Nurse Roberts	Morning, Dr. Kelso.
3612	Dr. Kelso	Nurses.Oh, get up!
3613	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3614	Alex	I wanna apologize for not showing up last night; I-I got home, I sat on the couch, and I just totally passed out!
3615	J.D.	You know, I wasn't' even sure we had a definite plan, so....
3616	Alex	Anyway, I'm sorry I couldn't make it.
3617	Janitor	She seems sorry. I am, too.
3618	Turk	Someone call for a surgical consult?
3619	Dr. Cox	You're Dr. Turk?
3620	Turk	Mm-hmm.
3621	Dr. Cox	Of course you are. Note to self: You've got to start writing down the names of people that truly annoy you!
3622	Turk	Yeah, yeah; well, um, what's up?
3623	Dr. Cox	The guy has two-vessel disease, and he hasn't been tried on medical management, so he's got a couple options and neither....
3624	J.D.'s Narration	When an Attending calls a lowly intern for a consult, it's an unwritten law that the intern should agree with whatever he says.
3625	Dr. Cox	...Don't you agree?
3626	Turk	Actually, sir, uh, I recommend bypass surgery.
3627	J.D.	Wow...that's my pager!
3628	Dr. Cox	You're wrong. He's so wrong!You make me so angry I.... I-.... I.... I have to pee.
3629	Turk	Me too.
3630	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3631	J.D.'s Thoughts	Look at her. She's not even gonna say hi to me! Fine; I won't say hi to her. Ever!I can't believe how stubborn she is she she is not even moving out of the way. I am the wrong man to play chicken with, missy. She'll blink.... Any second now.
3632	J.D.	She is so stubborn!
3633	Carla	Laverne, could you had me some gauze, please?
3634	Nurse Roberts	Maybe Dr. Kelso can pick you up in the morning and take you to the gauze store.
3635	Carla	All right, now listen
3636	Dr. Kelso	Carla, this paperwork has your signature on it, and it is totally sub-par!I won't stand for this kind of shoddy work!
3637	Nurse Roberts	Let me help you, Honey.
3638	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3639	Turk	So, you went behind my back and got an intern to agree with you so the guy doesn't get surgery.
3640	Dr. Cox	Oh, no; you caught me.
3641	Turk	Cox, a bypass is the right call.
3642	Dr. Cox	Considering the inherent risks in surgery, I didn't
3643	Turk	The guy's a diabetic, with two-vessel disease!
3644	Dr. Cox	And antianginals can be equally effective.
3645	Turk	So we agree that either treatment could work?
3646	Dr. Cox	Yeah, sure.
3647	Turk	Then what the hell are we arguing about!?
3648	Carla	Hey!
3649	Turk	Hey, Babe.
3650	Dr. Cox	Hey, Sweetie.
3651	J.D.'s Narration	And it was just then that they realized what was really going on: Dr. Cox was in love with Turk's girlfriend!
3652	Carla	Hey, either one of you want half a sandwich?
3653	Dr. Cox	I'm all set.
3654	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3655	J.D.	So, every tox-screen came back negative on Mr. Barnes. He didn't...take anything.
3656	Elliot	So?
3657	J.D.	So...you were wrong.
3658	Elliot	Yeah, it's not about that anymore, is it?
3659	J.D.'s Narration	When you can't make things right with one of your best friends, nothing can make you feel better.
3660	Alex	Hey, I'm finally off; do you wanna get out of here?Hello?
3661	J.D.	So, are we doing this, or what?
3662	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3663	Carla	Dr. Kelso.
3664	Dr. Kelso	Yes, what is it?
3665	Carla	I wanted to thank you...for what you did. You know, when you yelled at me in front of the other nurses. I appreciate it.
3666	Dr. Kelso	Young lady, I yelled at you because that paperwork looked like it had been done by a drunk four-year-old. Listen, Carla, I have a family who loves me, a handful of close friends, and a wonderful hobby shop in my basement; I don't spend much time worrying about people's feelings around here I just do whatever makes me happy.
3667	Carla	So...can I still get a ride tomorrow?
3668	Dr. Kelso	I don't know if I've forgiven you yet for hiding this morning. But, uh, you could always skip the bus tomorrow morning and take your chances.
3669	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3670	Dr. Cox	Look, we're both men; one of us a little more than the other, but that's okay.
3671	Turk	What do you want?
3672	Dr. Cox	I'm not gonna do anything to mess up what you got with Carla that's not my game.
3673	Turk	I won't tell Carla how you feel about her that's not my place.
3674	Dr. Cox	But, the minute you screw this thing up and you will screw it up I'll be waiting.
3675	Turk	Well, if you're gonna wait, I'd bring a book, 'cause it's gonna be a while.
3676	Dr. Cox	You goin' in?
3677	Turk	Oh, yeah, I'm right behind you.
3678	Dr. Cox	Cool.
3679	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3680	J.D.	You remember, like, when the new 'Star Wars' movie came out, and it was all built up, and then people went to see it and it really wasn't that great in bed?
3681	Alex	Relax! The first one's a freebie, so you can get your form back.Mmm. I'm gonna change.
3682	J.D.	Mm-mm, Mm-mm. Don't look, no, no. Don't look, no, no.I already brushed, like, eight times, but I'm gonna wanna take some mints out of your purse.
3683	Alex	See, all I did was lose the pants, but I think it gives me a completely different look.
3684	J.D.	These are Percocet.
3685	Alex	J.D....
3686	J.D.	So, you never came over here last night 'cause you just passed out.
3687	Alex	Yep...I should I should go; yeah.
3688	J.D.'s Narration	The speech always sounds the same, no matter whose mouth is comes out of even if it's someone you thought you could really like.
3689	Alex	Hey, look, you don't understand, okay; my job comes with a lot of stress. It's it's not like I have a serious problem.
3690	J.D.'s Narration	We ended up talking for a while after that....
3691	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3692	J.D.'s Narration	And I gave her some names of people that could help her.But she never got back to me.After that, things pretty much got back to normal.
3693	Janitor	You owe me twenty bucks.
3694	J.D.	No, but I never even made
3695	Janitor	Twenty bucks.
3696	J.D.	All right, I should've done this a long time ago; so, here goes: I'm sorry. I shouldn't accuse you of being jealous, you were just looking out for me, and...you were right about Alex.
3697	Elliot	You never did sleep with her, did you?
3698	J.D.	No.... But, why does that matter?
3699	Elliot	Because I was jealous.
3700	J.D.	Are you sure?
3701	Cut to	J.D.'s Bedroom
3702	Elliot	What are you thinking about?
3703	J.D.	This.
3704	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3705	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, my God; you slept with your best friend! This will be a disaster unless you say he right thing, so choose your words carefully.
3706	J.D.	Great job last night, buddy.
3707	J.D.'s Thoughts	Ew.
3708	J.D.	Good thing you came along. I've been stuck on four since med school.OWWWWW!
3709	Cut to	The Living Room
3710	Elliot	Dammit.We we really shouldn't feel weird about this. I mean, this things like this happen all the time.
3711	J.D.	All the time!
3712	Elliot	Yeah, it's, uh, it's really not a big deal.
3713	J.D.	It's not a big deal!
3714	Elliot	Okay, you've gotta stop repeating everything I say in that weird tone of voice.
3715	J.D.	No more repeating....
3716	Elliot	Look, J.D., what happened last night was a wonderful mistake. I think it's probably best if we just go back to the way things were.
3717	J.D.	I totally agree.
3718	Elliot	Well, I'm gonna see you tomorrow.
3719	J.D.	Tomorrow...
3720	J.D.'s Thoughts	What are you doing? Elliot's amazing, and you're crazy about her. If you let her leave, I'm gonna do this all day: "I get knocked down! But I get up again! You're never gonna keep me down! I get knocked down! "
3721	J.D.	Wait, Elliot.Look, I just, uh.... Argggh.... I...I....
3722	Elliot	Oh, my God, just say it! Say, "Elliot, stay in bed and have sex with me all day until neither one of us can move."
3723	J.D.	Yeah, let's do that.
3724	Elliot	I cannot believe you almost let me leave.You're gonna pay for that.
3725	J.D.	Oh, I'm I'm good for that.Whoa.... I got...to, uh....
3726	JD	Ow!
3727	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3728	J.D.	We are really good at having sex.We should, like, take this show on the road.
3729	Elliot	Oh, don't joke. My mom would come sit in the front row and tell me I'd look prettier if I smiled more.
3730	J.D.	You don't really smile, though, you just make this face...
3731	Elliot	What about you? You just look surprised that you're actually having sex!
3732	J.D.	Well, I was, girl. I mean, four times? I mean, seriously, give it up.
3733	Elliot	I think I already did.
3734	J.D.	Yeah, you did.
3735	Elliot	God, how weird was that this morning? I mean, have you ever been more uncomfortable in your entire life?
3736	J.D.'s Grandmother	What movie are we watching?
3737	J.D.	It's 'Basic Instinct', grandma....Yeah, once. But see, all this sex, it just soothes my soul....
3738	Elliot	Mmmm.
3739	J.D.	...And I really like your nose....
3740	Elliot	How did that last time even start?
3741	J.D.	I don't even remember. I just know I went to the door, and when I came back, you said I looked sexy holding a pizza.
3742	Elliot	Oooh, you did.Okay, for safety reasons, I should go. I should really go.
3743	J.D.	No, no....
3744	Elliot	Yep.
3745	J.D.	You're not going anywhere; 'cause you know why? You gotta help me eat this pizza.
3746	Elliot	Okay.
3747	J.D.	See, now, you even look sexy holding that slice.
3748	Elliot	...I do, don't I?
3749	J.D.	You do.
3750	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3751	Elliot	I was not, you were!
3752	J.D.	Hey, baby, sometimes I like a little sugar in my coffee!
3753	Elliot	No, J.D. J.D., I just think it's best if we keep this between us for right now. I mean, it's hard enough at work without everybody talking.
3754	J.D.	But it'll it'll help people.Like those two, for instance. I mean, they've been dancing around each other for months, now.And you know what, excuse me for not being afraid to show people around here how I feel about you.
3755	Elliot	You just want the guys to know you're getting some!
3756	J.D.	Not just the guys.Good morning, Dr. Cox!
3757	Dr. Cox	We are short staffed today because Kelso has volunteered all of you scut-monkeys for some psychologist's research project give me a break which means, of course, you won't be helping patients. Instead...oh, you'll be blabbering about your feelings and what it's like working in the hospital, and how that affects your personal lives...and: Wah. Wah. Wah.And there he is now; oh, Big Bobbo, himself. Okay, all nurses and interns, let's gather 'round and dance for the puppet master! Oh, yes! Dance!
3758	Dr. Kelso	It's not just the nurses and interns....
3759	Dr. Cox	Don't be that guy, Bob.Well gosh, I guess I became a doctor because, ever since I was a little boy, I just wanted to help people. I don't...tell this story very often, but, I remember when I was seven years old, one time I found a bird that had fallen out of its nest. And so, I picked him up, and I brought him home, and I made him a house out of an empty shoebox, and Oh my God! I became a doctor for the same four reasons everybody does: Chicks, money, power, and chicks. But, since HMOs have made it virtually impossible to make any real money, which directly affects the number of chicks who come sniffing around and don't ask me what tree they're barkin' up, 'cause they're sure as hell not pissin' on mine. And as far as power goes, well, here I am during my free time letting some thirteen-year-old psychology fellow who couldn't cut it in real medicine ask me questions about my personal life. So, here's the inside scoop, there, pumpkin: Why don't you go ahead and tell me all about power.
3760	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3761	Todd	Check her out!
3762	Turk	Dude, H.F.F.A.
3763	J.D.	Excuse me?
3764	Turk	"H.F.F.A"? "Hot From Far Away", but up close, she's nasty?Baby, I am so sorry I made an incredibly insensitive statement about an ugly person.
3765	Carla	I'm taking one of those quiet moments where I weigh your good qualities against your bad ones and decide if you're actually worth the trouble.You made it. But that was close.
3766	Turk	Thank you, baby!
3767	Carla	You're welcome!
3768	Turk	So, Elliot says she's looking for a surgical consult. Do you know where she is?
3769	J.D.	I don't know. Why should I know? You know, it's funny that you think I would know I have no idea where she is.
3770	Todd	I know where The Todd would like Elliot to be: In his pants!
3771	J.D.	Ha! Clever! You know, she told me she's not going out with anyone, you should ask her out.
3772	Turk	Whoa, Ell no, no. Elliot and The Todd? That's a terrible couple. That's that's worse than Joanie and Chachi.
3773	J.D.	Dude, Joanie loves Chachi.
3774	Todd	The Todd is asking Elliot out. I think she'd be lucky to ride my
3775	J.D.	Please....
3776	Todd	...Motorcycle! Gotcha!
3777	Turk	God bless him.When I was seven years old, the only things that I loved were my ColecoVision and Sandi Lowe. Now, Sandi was as fine as a seven-year-old could be; I mean, she had the body of a nine-year-old. And I pretty much joined the t-ball team because she was on it. I mean, I didn't really care that much about sports. But, uh, during the first game, I got all caught up, you know? And...fell in love with competing; and so, through high school and college, I pretty much played everything, because I needed to compete it was my drug. I think that's why I became a surgeon, too, because, every day, you get to step up to the table and go one-on-one against what's-ever wrong with the patient. And if you're really good at it, you win most of the time....
3778	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3779	Elliot	Are you following me?
3780	Todd	No! You wanna go out sometime?
3781	Elliot	With you?
3782	Todd	Me...and a bottle of Jagermeister!
3783	Elliot	No. No, Todd, I don't. But I don't want you to think it's because I just broke up with someone, or that I'm a lesbian, or because I want to 'preserve our friendship.' It's because I find you so creepy I think you should have to walk around with a bell around your neck.
3784	Todd	All I heard was "lesbian."
3785	J.D.	You know what, let me let me talk to her for ya.
3786	Todd	Okay.
3787	Elliot	Why did he ask me out?
3788	J.D.	I don't know.... Because you're cute, and you're fun...and I told him to....
3789	Elliot	What?
3790	J.D.	Plus, there's rumors going around that you're a lesbian.Look, you told me not to tell anyone about us, and I guess maybe I just wanted to make a point. And, uh...now I'm gonna kiss you.
3791	Todd	Oh, no, it's cool. J.D.'s in the closet talking to a girl for me.
3792	Nurse Roberts	White boys.
3793	Todd	You too!
3794	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3795	Carla	When I was a little girl, my mom used to have what she liked to call "Episodes." "Episodes" is a flattering term for this thing where she'd sweat a lot and...well, let's just say, her stomach talked. Anyway, this one time, we were at the supermarket and she actually passed out. And, out of nowhere, this fancy-looking guy comes forward and tells everyone to "step aside!" give my mother some air. And everyone did! You have to understand: in my family, nobody ever listens to a word anybody else says; even screaming at the top of our lungs nothing. So, when this man said "step aside" and everyone did, I asked my aunt, "Who is this guy?" And she said he was a doctor. And I thought, "Wow.... I wanna be a doctor, too." But, when I lost my first tooth, and nobody left a hundred-and-eighty-thousand dollars under my pillow, I decided to become a nurse....
3796	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3797	J.D.	You okay?
3798	Elliot	...Yeah. I mean, I may, eventually, need a vagina transplant.
3799	EMT	Go, go, go, go, go!We don't have much time!!!
3800	Elliot	You know what, after I have sex five times with somebody, I...usually like to have the relationship talk.I know, I know it seems rushed, but, you have to understand, five times usually takes me anywhere between six months and seven years.
3801	J.D.	Okay, let's do it; let's have the talk.
3802	Elliot	Okay. You my boyfriend?
3803	J.D.	Yep. You my girlfriend?
3804	Elliot	Yep!
3805	J.D.	Cool.Good to talk things through.
3806	Elliot	I love that little laugh!
3807	J.D.	Well, from now on, that is your laugh.
3808	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3809	Elliot	What?
3810	J.D.	I've seen you naked, so, like, everything you're doing, I'm watching you do it...naked.
3811	Elliot	Ohh.... So if I go like this:
3812	J.D.	Yeah, I just, I saw all of that.Ohh, don't be shy; come here, baby....See the echo report on the aorta...
3813	Dr. Cox	Bravo; just a big bravo. Heaven help me, I love Newbie Theatre. Honest, I do.It's the way you both play your parts with such wonderful commitment that almost had me believing that you aren't having whiny, neurotic, extremely pale sex with each other.
3814	J.D.	What are you talking about?
3815	Dr. Cox	Please stop. The whole floor knows; we do. Watch this.Laverne, did you know?
3816	Nurse Roberts	Was it supposed to be a secret?
3817	Dr. Cox	And, Carla?
3818	Carla	Please. I knew before they did.
3819	Dr. Cox	So, there it is. Oh, and, if you go ahead and listen very carefully, you'll hear the familiar sound of no one caring.
3820	Janitor	I like that guy.
3821	Dr. Kelso	When the Kelsonoviches settled in Monroeville, P.A., there were two steel mills, three bars, not a doctor in sight. Then, my old man set up a shingle and started delivering babies and stitching up three-fingered steel men by the wagon-load. Everybody loved him. When they couldn't come up with the cash, he would always gladly accept a handmade sweater or a bushel of turnips.... Jackass.
3822	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3823	J.D.	Now I get to do this in public...
3824	Turk	This is a hospital, all right, people here are already sick.
3825	Elliot	You guys do it all the time.
3826	Carla	Tell me we don't look like that.
3827	Turk	We don't look like that!
3828	J.D.	Oh, please, you guys are just jealous 'cause you're not the new hot couple in town anymore.
3829	Turk	Jealous, my chocolate butt!
3830	Carla	I'm telling you, we are so damn hot; last night, when I was home waiting for Turk, I put on this tiny negligee it was so small, I took it off my Latin Barbie
3831	Turk	Yeah but, baby, when I got home you were sound asleep and drooling like a sheepdog.
3832	Carla	You don't have to tell them that.
3833	J.D.	Well, I tell you what, while you guys were sleeping, we were up in the kitchen, fryin' up some love!
3834	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3835	Dr. Cox	Relationships. Well, Sigmund, relationships are so fragile, it just takes one thing, one...tiny little offense, and it can snowball on ya. And if that snowball starts to pick up speed, God forbid, you better tuck and go, my friend.
3836	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3837	Elliot	Why did you just do that? I mean, how could you possibly think that's appropriate conversation for work?Uh, we didn't have sex.
3838	J.D.	No....Especially not on the stove....What, I didn't....
3839	Elliot	That is not funny.
3840	J.D.	I'm sorry.We didn't.
3841	Elliot	Oh, that's great. Thanks, um, thanks a lot, J.D. Really mature.

3844	Elliot	Oh, my God, I am so full.... Gimme another slice.
3845	J.D.	Really?
3846	Elliot	Yeah. Big one.
3847	J.D.	I cannot have anymore until I work off the last two slices.So, what do you say: fat, gassy, bloaty sex?
3848	Elliot	Okay.Oh, I'm gonna puke!
3849	J.D.	I don't care.
3850	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3851	J.D.	Okay, Mr. Lewis, I'm afraid we're gonna need another stool sample. Not for medical reasons...my robot needs food.
3852	Elliot	Ohh.... that laugh.
3853	J.D.	But it's your laugh I gave it to you.
3854	Elliot	Yeah, I love it so much, I can't stop using it.
3855	J.D.	Well, see, it's not as charming if you're mad.
3856	Elliot	You know you only laugh at your own jokes? I mean, you never laugh at anything I do.
3857	J.D.	That's not true.
3858	Elliot	Oh hey, Dr. Cox, I'm open! Hit me!There was nothing funny about that.
3859	J.D.	Oh, all right, maybe you just don't know funny. Okay; let me help you out: Silly hats are funny; ALF, very funny; anyone in a chicken suit.... Oh! Over-sized phones are funny.
3860	Elliot	J.D....
3861	J.D.	Hold on.Hello? ... ... She's right here.It's for you.
3862	Elliot	You know what, you're not as funny as you think you are.
3863	Cut to	The Psychologist's Office
3864	Dr. Cox	...And bam! The shine's off the apple. And that's when you find out that that pretty little girl you married isn't a pretty little girl at all. No, she's a man-eater. And I'm not talking about the "whoa-whoa, here she comes" kind of man-eater. I'm talking about the kind that uses your dignity as a dishtowel to wipe up any shreds of manhood that might be stuck inside the sink. Of course, I may have tormented her from time to time; but, honest to God, that's what I thought marriage was all about. So much so that, by the end of that relationship, I honestly don't know who I hated more her or me? I used to sit around and wonder...why our friends weren't trying to destroy each other, like we were. And here, it turns out, the answer's pretty simple: They weren't unhappy. We were.

3866	Elliot	I suck at this. Sorry.
3867	J.D.	You look great bent over!
3868	Elliot	I'm not being obsessive, but I rolled that damn thing exactly the way the video I bought told me to.
3869	J.D.	Probably just a bad ball.
3870	Elliot	You don't always have to patronize me, I mean, you could just be honest with me and tell me that I suck.
3871	J.D.	You know what, Elliot, it's hard to be honest with you when you're so neurotic, you don't even trust the computer to keep your score.
3872	Elliot	Oh, so now I'm neurotic.
3873	J.D.	I'm sorry!
3874	Elliot	Is it always this hard?
3875	J.D.	Bowling's a tricky sport.
3876	Elliot	No, I meant
3877	J.D.	I know what you meant. It's difficult for everybody.

3886	Elliot	Mm-hmm.
3887	Cut to	The Psychologist's Office
3888	Dr. Kelso	Enid has always understood how much my career meant to me. She knows I'm an important man in my field, and it helps her get on all those little boards of things her friends are on.... You know, like, uh, bringing art to the underprivileged kids in the community, blah-blah-blah. When I first met her, uh, she wanted the be a psychiatrist, but, uh...we both decided that that wasn't a fitting profession for a family woman no offense, sweetheart. I know she's grateful. She likes to joke that I "choked the last breath of life out of her long ago, now she's just a shell of a woman." I think that's so cute; I call her "shelly"! You know, when I call her that, sometimes she laughs so hard she cries a little.

3890	Dr. Cox	Oh, what the hell, Barbie? You should have gotten the cardiology fellow to give Mrs. Zuckerman a transvenous pacemaker one hour ago.
3891	Elliot	Sir, I was waiting to see if
3892	Dr. Cox	Oh! You were waiting! I'm sorry, that's that's my mistake.... Oh! I'm gonna wait with ya!
3893	Elliot	Dr. Cox
3894	Dr. Cox	You gotta give it time; because you see, when you're waiting for someone to magically get better all by themselves, the whole thing becomes about time.
3895	Elliot	Dr. Cox, I was waiting to see if she would tolerate her low heart-rate, which is exactly what all the medical textbooks tell us to do. Am I right, J.D.?
3896	Dr. Cox	Is she right, J.D.?
3897	J.D.	Uhhhh.... Well, technically, yes.But, you know, it's it's really a judgment call, and if she really was that bradycardic, I probably would've called the fellow....But I, that's that's me. I....
3898	Dr. Cox	Wow. Always side with the hoochie, Newbie. It's rookie mistake. Gosh, you you hate to see it.
3899	Cut to	The Psychologist's Office
3900	Carla	You want me to tell you about my boyfriend?
3901	Turk	You want me to tell you about my girlfriend?Okay, um.... I can be myself around Carla, you know?
3902	Carla	Turk makes me feel completely safe, and totally independent at the same time.
3903	Turk	...And uh, it's it's all the same, whether I'm with her, or with my boys.
3904	Carla	I can say whatever's on my mind and even if he doesn't like it even if he doesn't understand it he respects it.
3905	Turk	Don't get me wrong, I'm not gonna give my boys a back rub; I mean, sure, if a brothah's got an itch, I'll scratch it, but...
3906	Carla	He seems to like who I am.
3907	Turk	She's a cool lady.
3908	Carla	I love him.
3909	Turk	I love her.

3911	J.D.	Hey.... I shoulda stood up for you with Dr. Cox.
3912	Elliot	Yeah, you should've.
3913	J.D.	I just I I don't want him to think it's about our relationship.
3914	Elliot	Look, I know that you want Dr. Cox to like you and to respect you, but you should want me to like and respect you, too.
3915	J.D.	Well, if I didn't respect you, I wouldn't be having sex with you. ...That's not true, I totally would be!
3916	Elliot	Look, if you can't talk about this for real, then forget it.
3917	J.D.	Ohh, a perfect dismount off her high horse.
3918	Elliot	If you don't like something, why don't you just say it; I mean, why do you always have to hide behind your stupid little jokes!?
3919	J.D.	Why is it impossible for you to ever let anything go?
3920	Elliot	Oh, I let tons of stuff go; like when you wouldn't stand up for me in front of Dr. Cox. Or when you started telling everyone we know that we're having sex.
3921	J.D.	And when are you when are you letting that stuff go?
3922	Elliot	Fine. You wanna know why I won't let that go? Because the only reason that you wouldn't stand up for me is that you're so terrified that someone, somewhere, in this hospital won't like you.
3923	J.D.	Oh, and that's a bad thing? That's a bad thing, Elliot? Why don't why don't we get all of my friends together in a room and we'll fight your friend.
3924	Elliot	I'm getting so tired of this.
3925	J.D.	Look, Elliot, this is me, okay? And there's a lot of people here who like me for who I am. I thought you were one of 'em.
3926	Elliot	I thought I was, too.
3927	Dr. Cox	Relationships don't work the way they do on television and in the movies: Will they, won't they, and then they finally do and they're happy forever gimme a break. Nine out of ten of them end because they weren't right for each other to begin with, and half the ones that get married get divorced, anyway. And I'm telling you right now, through all this stuff, I have not become a cynic, I haven't. Yes, I do happen to believe that love is mainly about pushing chocolate-covered candies and, you know, in some cultures, a chicken. You can call me a sucker, I don't care, 'cause I do...believe in it. Bottom line...is the couples that are truly right for each other wade through the same crap as everybody else, but, the big difference is, they don't let it take 'em down.....One of those two people will stand up and fight for that relationship every time, if it's right, and they're real lucky. One of them will say something.
3928	Cut to	The Psychologist's Office
3929	J.D.	Things that wouldn't'a bothered you a week ago in a friendship become so incredibly important when sex is involved. I just...I think it'd be easier if you weren't friends with your girlfriend.... At all.
3930	Cut to	Elliot, taking her turn.
3931	Elliot	I've always been so sure about everything in my life. I was I was sure I that wanted to be a doctor, and I was sure that I was gonna be married by the time I was 25.... But, relationships.... I always heard that when they were right, they were easy. That that, even when things got hard...that they were easy. I don't get that at all, you know. How is that possible?
3932	Cut to	J.D.
3933	J.D.	Am I in a relationship now?
3934	Back to	Elliot

3942	Elliot	If you tell anyone anything about today, please leave that part out.
3943	J.D.	I will. 'Cause I'm a gentleman.

3981	J.D.	I used to like the Silver Surfer.Hang ten! Hang...

4354	J.D.	Wh-what was it that tipped you off? Was it your, uh, inability to perform even the simplest task? I'll bet it was the fact that I only got home twenty minutes ago because I spent the entire night cleaning up after you!
4355	Josh	I'm sorry. Um...I was just really scared.
4356	J.D.	Well, you know what, Josh, you should be scared. Because, I gotta be honest with you I don't think you got what it takes.

4389	Dr. Cox	Which is what, exactly?

Of course, then you'd be providing some jackass with a wall on which to lean against and reflect on what a jackass he truly is. I know! Here, it's a conundrum. But don't you worry about it I'll tackle that one right upstairs . In the meantime, you could at least pretend to be doing some work.

4440	Philip	I don't wanna. But, if you've got a problem with that, go-go see my father.
4441	Elliot	I think I'll do that.

4451	Dr. Cox	I don't honestly know, to tell you the truth. I'm I guess it's 'cause I don't have anything of interest to say.
4452	Turk	You got nothing to worry about, 'cause I got something to say. Dr. Cox, you are an attending; so you should know that it is highly inappropriate for you to be sniffing around this woman all day long!And you! You are a med student who should be learning from me, but every time I turn around, you're talking to him. So I'm telling you right now, I forbid you to get involved with that guy.
4453	Kristen	Sorry, doctor.

4497	Philip	Dr. Reid, I wrote out your admission orders, and I got the blood cultures that you wanted.
4498	Elliot	Good. Now beat it I'm eating.
4499	Carla	Elliot, you ball-buster!
4500	Elliot	I know, isn't it great!
4501	J.D.'s Narration	I think a lot of us get freaked out when med students come because it feels like being forced to accept new people into your family.It changes everything. Me, I was more struck by how these "newbies" made me look at myself....

4503	J.D.'s Narration	Who I used to be.... Who I am now.... And who I might someday become.But hopefully, not too soon.
4504	J.D.	Player!
4505	Turk	Hold me down!
4506	Carla	Such dorks.

4510	Elliot	Can I trade clipboards with you?Okay fine... but mine's better ...
4511	Jerry	You wanna trade?
4512	Elliot	I guess.
4513	J.D.	Elliot, have you seen my clipboard?
4514	Elliot	No. Nope. Oh, this'll be fun. J.D., I would like you to meet, J.D.
4515	J.D.	How's it going, man?
4516	Jerry	Make him leave.
4517	J.D.	Are you bummed out that we have the same name?Oh, don't don't worry about it, man; I'll tell you what you're a little bit older than I am, so you were J.D. first. So how about you'll be J.D. Number One, and I'll just be J.D. Number Two. How about that?
4518	Jerry	Hey Number Two.
4519	J.D.	Hey Number One. So, uh, I've got one more patient, do you want to have lunch in ten minutes and you can bring my clipboard?
4520	Elliot	Yeah.
4521	J.D.	Okay.
4522	Jerry	Hey, Number Two!
4523	J.D.	Number One!All right, cool.
4524	Jerry	Hey, Number Two!
4525	J.D.	Number One!
4526	J.D.'s Narration	I honestly think the best part about working here is the patients. When they see how much you care, they're always grateful.
4527	Mr. Simon	About time. Idiot.
4528	J.D.	Okay, Mr. Simon. Good morning, how you feeling?
4529	Mr. Simon	I was just asking Nurse Fajita here if you guys get extra points for asking stupid questions.
4530	J.D.	No, sir, I was just trying to assess how you're
4531	Carla	Bambi. Don't bother.
4532	J.D.	Carla, please. Sir, if there's anything I can do to make your stay here more comfortable
4533	Mr. Simon	You can kiss my man-sized ass!
4534	J.D.	Okay. Will you hold me after?Maybe we shouldn't bother.

4539	Carla	Hey Bambi, you know Mr. Simon made one of the night nurses cry?
4540	J.D.	Which one?
4541	Carla	Frank.
4542	J.D.	Frank used to be a Navy SEAL.
4543	Jerry	Hey, Number Two!
4544	J.D.	Hey, Number One.
4545	Kristen	You are a brave man. You're an attending here and not only you're dating a med student, you're holding hands with her in public.
4546	Dr. Cox	Well, normally I would never do this, but there are mitigating factors.
4547	Kristen	Like what?
4548	Dr. Cox	Well, for starters, you are very hot.
4549	Kristen	Listen, I have kind of a special evening planned for us. I'm not going to give away everything, but I will say it involves wine, an amazing dinner, and a safety word we've agreed upon in advance.
4550	Dr. Cox	God, you are going to make a great mom.

4552	Turk	I told you what to do if the stitches on your chest start to itch.
4553	Mr. Sloane	Don't scratch.
4554	Turk	Unless they're really itchy. Then you go to town, you go nuts, you do your thing.
4555	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Reid, one of the nurses found your stethoscope in the bathroom.
4556	Elliot	Oh, thank you so much, sir
4557	Dr. Kelso	This isn't it, sweetheart. I had them leave yours where it was. Let's try to be a little more responsible, shall we?
4558	Mr. Sloane	I think I went to college with that guy.
4559	Elliot	Oh, lucky you.
4560	Mr. Sloane	Used to play his guitar every Saturday night at this coffee house off-campus.
4561	Turk	Remember the guy's name?
4562	Mr. Sloane	Oh...Robbie, something, I think.
4563	Elliot	You know, Dr. Kelso's name is Bob, which is short for Robert, and Robbie is another nickname for Robert!
4564	Turk	Like, oh, my God!
4565	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
4566	J.D.	Just give Mr. Simon thirty milligrams of MS Contin. I don't understand why I have to come with you.
4567	Carla	Because, Bambi, you're kind of like a doctor. Now come on, he's just another patient.
4568	J.D.	Simon says "Hello"!
4569	Mr. Simon	What the hell do you want?
4570	J.D.	Just going to have Carla here give you a little stronger pain medication.

4575	J.D.	Me no likey mean guys. Have you seen my stethoscope?

4580	Dr. Cox	Hey, Kristen, slow down!
4581	Kristen	You have no idea how many times you're going to say that tonight.
4582	Dr. Cox	Boy, you're making it hard.
4583	Kristen	You're going to say that, too.
4584	Dr. Cox	Kristen, look, something has come up and I'm not going to be able to make it tonight.
4585	Kristen	What?
4586	Dr. Cox	I know, I know, I'm sorry. But it's important. It's _very_ important.

4588	Carla	So thank you so much for giving me a ride to pick up my new dresser.
4589	Dr. Cox	Please, you know I love doing favors.
4590	Carla	You hate doing favors.
4591	Dr. Cox	But I like doing them for you, that's a fact. Now listen, even though I am in the best shape of my life and I am, by the way...I mean, fact of the matter is you could pretty much bounce a damn quarter off my butt, you know, if you...if you wanted to.
4592	Carla	I...don't have any change.
4593	Dr. Cox	Anyway, uh, I'm probably going to need your help getting the dresser up on the roof here.
4594	Carla	Oh, I'm sure you guys can handle it.
4595	Dr. Cox	Uh, I beg your pardon.

4600	Turk	Hey. You know that dresser I got for Carla yesterday? It's not for her place, it's for mine. Is she moving in? No-one asked me.What the hell is this crap?
4601	Elliot	It's Dr. Kelso! Mr. Sloane dropped the tape off.
4602	Turk	Why do you care so much, anyway?
4603	Elliot	I mean, I think it would be so interesting if there was this whole, like, romantic, creative, vulnerable side to him.I think it's a fascinating study of human behaviour.
4604	Turk	I think you're a fascinating study of human behaviour.
4605	Elliot	The music's not that bad.
4606	Singer	"You played a part/sweet Bunny/you broke my Tuscaloosa heart..."
4607	Turk	"My Tuscaloosa heart"?
4608	Elliot	You have to admit, if that was him, it'd be pretty weird.
4609	Turk	You have to admit, you're pretty weird.
4610	Elliot	Stop doing that!
4611	Turk	You stop doing that!

4613	J.D.'s Thoughts	Ahh, Mr. Simon's room.
4614	Carla	You don't have to hide from Mr. Simon.
4615	J.D.	I'm not hiding from Mr. Simon, I have a new exercise program; it's called 'Short Bursts'.
4616	Carla	Mmm, is it working?
4617	J.D.	Do you have to ask?
4618	Carla	Yeah.
4619	J.D.	Huh. Where did Mr. Simon go?
4620	Carla	Well, I'm guessing not heaven. He died.
4621	Jerry	Hey, Number Two!
4622	J.D.	Hey, Number One. What happened?
4623	Carla	Bambi, he had terminal metastatic colon cancer, he went into respiratory arrest and passed away.
4624	Jerry	Hey, Number Two!
4625	J.D.	Hey, Number One. Did you give him a dose of naloxone?
4626	Bambi	Yes, Bambi, we tried intubating him, we did CPR, we even tried transcutaneous pacing.
4627	Jerry	Hey, Number Two!
4628	J.D.	He went so fast.
4629	Carla	Yeah. Say "Hey, Number One".

4633	Kristen	Hey, it's Kristen. I missed you tonight. Don't get me wrong; I went ahead with the date on my own; but it would have been almost as fun if you were here. I wish you were here. See ya.
4634	Dr. Cox	You are a stupid, stupid man.
4635	Jordan	Hey honey, I'm home. You know, you should lock your door, there's horrible people out there.
4636	Dr. Cox	There's horrible people right in here.
4637	Jordan	Maybe you forgot how this works. See, when I say that "Hi honey" thing, you take your pants off. See, thems the rules of the booty call.
4638	Dr. Cox	Jordan, believe me, I enjoy our meaningless post-divorce sex as much as the next guy you marry will, but your timing cou-hould not be worse.
4639	Jordan	Oh, maybe you don't remember the terms of our settlement. When Jordan needs sex, Jordan gets sex.
4640	Dr. Cox	Listen, Sweetcheeks, I am seeing someone who
4641	Jordan	Let me guess, let me guess dark haired, domineering, doesn't take any of your crap? You see, a lesser person would mock your inability to move on. I'm going to consider it an homage.
4642	Dr. Cox	There is something so... soft about you.
4643	Jordan	Yeah.
4644	Dr. Cox	Look, I am seeing someone right now who, by the way, is great and yet there's this other woman who I cannot get out of my head. She's totally unavailable, which may be why I can't get her out of my head; and _maybe_ and this is a whole new theory I keep thinking of this other woman the unavailable one because I am so afraid that the first thing might actually work out; and God forbid I ever do something that might actually make _me_ happy. Do you have any idea what I'm talking about?
4645	Jordan	Oh my God. If I have to stay here and listen to this crap, I'll need a stronger drink.
4646	Dr. Cox	I hate you.
4647	Jordan	I hate you, too, honey.
4648	Dr. Cox	Fair enough.

4654	Elliot	I really think it was him.
4655	Turk	It wasn't.
4656	Elliot	Yeah, but what if it was?
4657	Turk	Oh, good Lord, woman.
4658	Dr. Kelso	Having a late-night tea party, are we? Oh, I guess my invitation must have been lost in the mail. Well, as long as I'm here, I'm partial to Lemon Zinger.
4659	Elliot	Sir, the reason Dr. Turk is here is because his patient is going into surgery tomorrow; but I was kind of hoping we could do an ERCP first?
4660	Dr. Kelso	Ahh, you're breaking my Tuscaloosa heart. Just turf him.
4661	Elliot	"Tuscaloosa heart", hmm? Um, this is what I like to call my 'Told-You-So Dance'.I told you so, I told you so, I-I-I told you so, I told you so, I told you so, I-I-I told you so.

4667	Carla	Not now, maybe in the morning before work...
4668	J.D.	Just thought I'd talk to you guys.
4669	Turk	J.D., when you were a kid, did you used to walk into your parent's room in the middle of the night?
4670	Young J.D.	Mommy, are you and Daddy playing wheelbarrow?
4671	J.D.'s Dad	Son, you go back to bed, I'm fixing Mommy's back.
4672	J.D.	Yes, once.
4673	Carla	Turk, you're not being very sensitive.
4674	Turk	I'll be sensitive at breakfast, baby. Turk out.
4675	Carla	What's up, Bambi?
4676	J.D.	I just can't stop thinking about Mr. Simon. I neglected him because he was such a jerk; and I'm just kinda worried that's what killed him.
4677	Carla	Well, could have been the neglect. Could have been the terminal cancer. Bambi, you're a conscientious doctor, you'd never do anything to hurt a patient, you know that.
4678	J.D.	You're right. Argh...thank you, Carla.
4679	Carla	Mmm-hmm.
4680	J.D.	Peace out, Turk!

4693	Carla	Bambi. About yesterday.
4694	J.D.	It's back?
4695	Carla	Uh, they want you to present Mr. Simon at a M and M conference this afternoon.
4696	J.D.'s Narration	Morbidity and Mortality conferences are just fun little meetings they have when they think you may be in any way responsible for a patient's death.
4697	Carla	Bambi. Don't be nervous.
4698	J.D.	Is it hot in here? It's, like, it's hot!No, I'm fine.

4714	Kristen	Do you think I'm a spy?
4715	Dr. Cox	No. Look, I just want you to know that I haven't been in this relationship a hundred percent, and it's because of how great you are and just exactly how much that scares me. But from now on, if you want... sister, you're going to be getting the whole shebang. 'Cause I'm all in, baby.

4720	Turk	That's because it's physically impossible to write a love song about anyone named "Enid".
4721	Elliot	Turk, don't you get it? This tape shows exactly why Kelso is... Kelso! I mean, he he used to be this beautiful, wonderful, sweet, caring man; he he found the love of his life and somehow she slipped through his hands.
4722	Carla	Oh, that is so sad.
4723	Turk	Have you guys ever stopped to think that maybe Bunny is just a real bunny.

4728	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Dorian, we have examined Aaron Simon's file. Before we begin, do you have any last words?
4729	J.D.	I'm a kay? That was terrible; can I have a do-over?
4730	Dr. Kelso	Initially there were concerns that Mr. Simon may have been over-medicated. We have concluded that his pain control was both adequate and well within normal limits. Thank you for stopping by.
4731	J.D.	Actually, Sir, I I'm not sure how this whole thing usually works, but I was kinda hoping we could take a closer look at me.I've been sorta doubting my performance, and it would it would be really helpful if we could all talk about it. As a group.
4732	J.D.'s Narration	Bottom line, Dr. Kelso isn't looking to do me any favors. If I did something wrong, he'd call me on it...

4735	Dr. Cox	Oh, joy.

4738	Jordan	No way, same here.
4739	Kristen	Really?
4740	Jordan	Yeah.
4741	Dr. Cox	Ohh-kay, this is beyond horrible.

4743	Kristen	Thank you.
4744	Jordan	You're welcome.
4745	Dr. Cox	Kristen... this is my emotional baggage. Baggage... Kristen.
4746	Kristen	Ohh, be nice.
4747	Carla	Hey, um, I just wanted to thank you again for helping me move that dresser last night.
4748	Dr. Cox	Oh, sure, no problem.
4749	Carla	Thank you. He's a great guy.
4750	Dr. Cox	See ya.
4751	Carla	Oh. Bye.
4752	Kristen	That's why you blew me off?
4753	Jordan	Oh, I should leave.
4754	Kristen	Moving furniture with that nurse you have a crush on. That's your "hundred percent"?
4755	Dr. Cox	No no, no no, the hundred percent actually came well after that. Look, her boyfriend was there the entire time, and if you want to know the truth, bailing on you is far and away the best thing that could have happened because it made me realise that I was sabotaging myself again. What, if you don't believe me, ask Jordan. Would you please tell her what I said to you right before you left this morning.
4756	Kristen	Left where?
4757	Dr. Cox	Uhh... um... uh...
4758	Kristen	You're unbelievable.

4765	Turk	Elliot, don't.
4766	Elliot	I won't.
4767	Turk	Pinky swear.
4768	Elliot	I heard some of your songs and I think they're extraordinary!
4769	Dr. Kelso	Excuse me?
4770	Turk	You swore!
4771	Elliot	You know what, um, just forget it. We won't bother you anymore.
4772	Turk	Sir... whatever happened to Bunny? We gotta know.
4773	Dr. Kelso	Well, actually, the music came before Bunny. I learned to play the guitar growing up as a young rapscallion in Mississippi; but things didn't really take off until I moved to Memphis. Then I met the Colonel, and the hits just kept coming! Unfortunately, it went to my head, I gained a lot of weight, started wearing a white jumpsuit and ate tranquilizers like they were trailmix.
4774	Elliot	Sir
4775	Dr. Kelso	Then, in 1977, I died on the toilet... Or did I?
4776	Turk	You never played the guitar, did you?
4777	Kelso	Son, that crap is for hippies. Now for God's sake, get back to work!
4778	Elliot	Yes sir.
4779	Kelso	Thank you very much.

4781	J.D.'s Thoughts	Ultimately, I always turn to the person I trust the most. Because I know when he looks me in the eye and says I didn't do anything wrong, I'll actually believe it.
4782	Dr. Cox	Yep, looks like you screwed the pooch there, Tinkerbell.
4783	J.D.	But I didn't overmedicate him!
4784	Dr. Cox	Of course you didn't, and I always check your orders after you make them. But if you're wondering whether or not you treated Mr. Simon differently because he's a complete jerk, well... I think you know the answer to that one already, don't you?
4785	J.D.	Depends what you mean by different, I
4786	Dr. Cox	I have to warn you, I just got dumped in front of my ex-wife not ten minutes ago, okay Betty? It's always easy to treat the nice ones nice, isn't it?
4787	J.D.	Uh huh.
4788	Dr. Cox	But your drug addicts, your child abusers, your garden-variety jerks... Man.
4789	J.D.	You know, it's, uh it's barely misting out...
4790	Dr. Cox	It's my hair, if it even gets damp, it frizzes out and becomes wildly unmanageable.
4791	J.D.	Mine too!
4792	Dr. Cox	It was a joke, you girl.Lookit, Newbie, the only way to judge your growth as a doctor hell, as a human being is by making sure you don't repeat the same mistakes over and over.
4793	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
4794	Jordan	That was really great and all, but next time would you do me a favour and not look at me in the eye, it really gets in the way of what I come here to do.
4795	Dr. Cox	Then, for God's sake, stop turning around!
4796	Jordan	Oh, that's classy.
4797	Dr. Cox	No, wait a minute you don't have to go... you know, if... if you don't want to.
4798	Jordan	Oh my God, are you really that lonely?
4799	Dr. Cox	Kinda, yeah.

4812	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
4813	J.D.'s Narration	And once you've accepted all sides of yourself, it's a lot easier to sleep at night.
4814	Jerry	Goodnight, Number Two.
4815	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
4816	Dr. Cox	Nothing... gotta be boobs somewhere... nothing... jackpot!
4817	Dr. Kelso	"Oh, it's sad, but it's true..."
4818	Dr. Cox	Cheers.
4819	Dr. Kelso	"...I love you."
4820	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
4821	J.D.'s Narration	So, here’s the deal: A month ago, Turk and Elliot wrote a paper on peripheral vascular disease. And now they’re upset because they have to present it at a big medical conference.
4822	J.D.	Do you know how many interns would die to do something like that? Not me, ‘cause I don’t really care about that stuff. Besides, I know in my heart my paper was, like, a trillion times better. And anyway, it’s so political I mean, surprise, surprise, they went with the black guy and the girl!
4823	Carla	Bambi.
4824	J.D.	What!?
4825	Carla	Mm-mm. Mm-mm.
4826	J.D.	Come on, what right do they have to be so damn mopey?
4827	J.D.'s Narration	And that’s when Elliot said something that explained everything.
4828	Elliot	Our parents are coming.
4829	J.D.	Oh, I am so sorry.
4830	J.D.'s Narration	I could tell my friends were pretty upset. Still, there was a bright side....
4831	J.D.	It’s all right.
4832	J.D.'s Narration	...I knew I could make it worse.
4833	J.D.	You missed a spot!
4834	Turk	You know, you can help. You can't even hear the television!
4835	J.D.	I like the pictures.
4836	J.D. Narration	If I believed in karma, I might be a little more cautious about giving these guys a hard time...
4837	J.D.	Hey, Dad. No, no, nothing. Turk and Elliot are freaking out because their parents are coming to visit.
4838	J.D. Narration	But karma doesn't scare me!
4839	J.D.	No, no, no, no, it hasn't been that long since you and I saw each other.Dad...
4840	Turk	Hey, Mr. Dorian!
4841	Mr. Dorian	Hey, boys. What's shakin'? Who needs a beer?
4842	Turk	Who doesn't?See, J.D., this is what goes around. And this? Is what comes around.
4843	Mr. Dorian	Only two left!
4844	Turk	That's okay. J.D.'ll go out.
4845	Mr. Dorian	Oh, get some chips!Wowzer! Rowdy's a boy dog.
4846	J.D. Narration	My mom and dad got divorced when I was seven. I know that's not so unusual but even though everyone's relationship with their father seems different, mine always seemed *very* different.
4847	Mr. Dorian	God, I'd like to take a run at her. Would you take a look at her rack?
4848	J.D.	Dad, please!
4849	Mr. Dorian	I'm sorry, Johnny. I'm just a man. And you know what they say about men.
4850	Turk	They love the boobies.
4851	Mr. Dorian	That is correct, Christopher.
4852	J.D.	Okay, you know, I think I'm going to hit the sack before I get even more uncomfortable.
4853	Mr. Dorian	You know, your mother had a beautiful bosom.
4854	J.D.	There it is!
4855	Mr. Dorian	Sit, would you? Stay. We've got a lot of catching up to do. Please. Do you guys have a policy on farting?
4856	Turk	No, let 'er rip.
4857	Mr. Dorian	Fire in the hole!
4858	J.D.	Oh, my God! Dad!
4859	Turk	Count it!
4860	J.D.	That was a nice moment.
4861	J.D. Narration	I guess everyone's parents drive them crazy.
4862	Elliot	So, this is my hospital.
4863	Dr. Reid	It's... stunning.
4864	Mrs. Reid	Honey, is there a rule against looking pretty here?
4865	Elliot	Uh, nothing official.
4866	Ms. Turk	I just think you would look so much more handsome in blue scrubs.
4867	Turk	Thank you, Mommy, but I really like my green scrubs better.
4868	Ms. Turk	Mmm-hmmm.
4869	J.D. Narration	Parents have a way of making their children regress.
4870	Young Turk	I don't wanna wear blue scrubs!
4871	Ms. Turk	C'mon, boy, you better watch your manners! Come on now!
4872	Young Elliot	Wahhhhhh!
4873	Mrs. Reid	No, you can't have one, sweetheart! Perms are for trailer trash!
4874	Dr. Cox	What in the hell is this? Parents weekend?
4875	J.D.	Well, sort of. Elliot and Turk wrote this paper and then my dad decided "I want to come, too!"
4876	Dr. Cox	Look, Reba, if I ask you a question that doesn't specifically deal with a medical issue, you can bet your powdered bottom that I don't want you to answer. Do you understand?
4877	J.D.	Yeah...
4878	Dr. Cox	It's like... working with a monkey!
4879	J.D.	Ooo! Ooo!
4880	Dr. Cox	What?
4881	J.D.	Nothing.
4882	Carla	Why didn't you introduce me to your mother this morning?
4883	Turk	Because she just came by to say hey before she checked into her hotel. Besides, she's coming back later on to look around.
4884	Carla	Okay. I was worried that you thought she might not like me.
4885	Turk	She's not going to like you. Baby, look, my mother's never actually called any girl I've been with by her actual name. Hell, she called my college girlfriend "The Big Easy".
4886	Carla	Well, was she fat and slutty?
4887	Turk	She had beautiful skin. Don't smile, woman. She did. Just beautiful.
4888	Elliot	So, what do you guys think?
4889	Mrs. Reid	Well, I think it's time to get back to the suite and get me into a bath. This place makes me feel dirty.
4890	Elliot	Dr. Kelso, Dr. Kelso! Uh, these are my parents.
4891	Dr. Kelso	Ah, well, it's always a pleasure to meet the trees from which our little acorns fall. Bob Kelso.
4892	Dr. Reid	Simon Reid. I'm Chief of Medicine at St. Augustine's. It's a private hospital in Greenwhich.
4893	Mrs. Reid	I know what you're thinking. You didn't ask. Nobody ever does.
4894	Elliot	So, uh, how long are you guys staying?
4895	J.D.	Can I help you, sir? Sir?
4896	Man	You can help me by minding your own damn business!
4897	J.D.	Excuse me?
4898	Man	Oh, aggressive, huh? Do you really want to get it on with me, Pipsqueak? Because if you do, I guarantee it'll be the last stupid thing you ever do on God's green earth.
4899	J.D.	Nice meeting you.
4900	J.D. Thoughts	What the hell was that about?
4901	Janitor	Dad! Don't wander off like that.
4902	Dr. Cox	This is your basic arthrocentesis, there, Newbie. Your resident should've showed you how to do this a long time ago.
4903	J.D.'s Thoughts	He can't be that mad. We both know that even though residents are supposed to teach you, they really only show up when they want something.
4904	Dr. Steadman	Hey, I have to give the med students a lecture on heart murmurs tomorrow. Could you cover for me?
4905	J.D.	Actually, I
4906	Dr. Steadman	Thanks, man.
4907	J.D.	That sucks. I totally wanted to spend some time with my dad tomorrow.
4908	Dr. Cox	Then take him?
4909	J.D.	What do you mean?
4910	Dr. Cox	Uh, I don't know, secure a vehicle of some kind car, balloon, tricycle and transport your father from wherever he is to where you're going to be.
4911	J.D.	I don't I don't think you really get my dad. He's not really interested in my work. He's more like a buddy.
4912	Dr. Cox	Ohhh-kay, that was my mistake. Here I engaged you and gave you the impression that I actually care which is just so wrong! God!
4913	J.D.	The thing is, I don't really need a buddy. What I need is a father.
4914	Dr. Cox	Well, you definitely need something. Um, maybe a backbone, or perhaps some testicles. At the very least, a pillow that you could carry around the hospital and just cry your sad eyes out into whenever drama occures.
4915	J.D.	I have testicles.He's he's a kidder! Heh.
4916	Turk	All right, this is it. You just brace yourself and let me handle this all nice and smooth like. All right? Hey, Mom! Guess what?
4917	Carla	Hi, Mrs. Turk. I'm gonna cut right to the chase. I'm Carla, and I apologize if your son hasn't told you about me yet. Honestly, I don't know how you put up with him as long as you did. Still, you should know he loves me very much, I feel the same way, and we're really, really good together.
4918	Mrs. Turk	Are you two sharing a bed?
4919	Turk	Noooo!
4920	Carla	Yes, ma'am, we are, but if you're a good judge of character, I think you can tell, I'm not messing around.
4921	Mrs. Turk	Carla. That's a nice name.
4922	Carla	Thank you.
4923	Turk	Listen, it is, Mother Mrs. Turk: Oh, please! Not telling me about her. Dear, do me a favor. Don't give him any for a month or so.
4924	Carla	Done!
4925	Turk	No, it can't go down like that! It just can't go down like that!
4926	Dr. Kelso	After you, sir.
4927	Dr. Reid	Well, I'll be. I haven't seen a ward like this since Vietnam.
4928	Dr. Kelso	So where in Connecticut was your National Guard unit stationed?
4929	Dr. Reid	Amusing.
4930	Dr. Kelso	I thought so.
4931	Elliot	I think they're totally getting along, don't you?
4932	Dr. Reid	I'm about to open a big fat can of whoop ass on you!
4933	Dr. Kelso	Bring it on, bitch!All right, sports fans! We have a guest today at rounds so let's try and be sharp. Why don't we begin with, uh... I don't know... Dr. Reid! What is the nutritional cause of high output cardiac failure?
4934	Elliot	Wet beriberi from thiamine deficiency?
4935	Dr. Kelso	Yes, it is. Next question. Why don't we try, um... Dr. Reid!
4936	Elliot	Um, I already went, sir.
4937	Dr. Kelso	Oh, are you done for the day?
4938	Elliot	No.
4939	Dr. Kelso	What is the mechanism of cheyne-stokes respiration in systolic dysfunction?
4940	J.D.'s Thoughts	What? Nobody knows that.
4941	Elliot	Prolongation of circulation time from the lung to the brain, causing diminished sensitivity of the respiratorcenter to arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide?
4942	Dr. Kelso	Yes.
4943	Elliot	Can you believe my dad winked at me?
4944	J.D.	If that's not saying, "I love you and I'm proud of you," I'm not really sure what is.
4945	Elliot	I know! Lemme tell ya, there are no gratuitous winks in the Reid household. It's like...
4946	J.D.'s Narration	And that's when I decided to take a chance.
4947	Mr. Dorian	Are you kidding? I'd love to come to your heart murmur lecture! I'm a big fan of those things!
4948	J.D.	That means a lot, Dad.
4949	Mr. Dorian	Yeah, absolutely.
4950	Dr. Cox	Oh, dear Lord, please make it stop.
4951	Carla	It's absolutely stunning.
4952	Ms. Turk	Thank you. And I understand you make them.
4953	Carla	Yes, I make them. I'd be happy to make...
4954	Turk	Look at them. Like two wolves gabbing about which sheep to eat. Unfortunately for them, I'm a man.
4955	Carla	Turk!
4956	Turk	Coming!
4957	Carla	Thank you.
4958	J.D.	Hi, Ms. Turk.
4959	Ms. Turk	John Dorian, get over here.
4960	J.D.	Well, uhh, umm...
4961	Ms. Turk	After all these years, are you still afraid of me?
4962	J.D.	Well, remember on Thanksgiving when I said your turkey was dry and you picked me up and shook me?
4963	Ms. Turk	Well, then, don't say that.
4964	Carla	Silly Bambi.
4965	Turk	Okay, you guys, leave him alone. And I've had enough of you two conspiring and whatnot. It ends now!
4966	Ms. Turk	It is so cute when he thinks he's in charge.
4967	Carla	I know! It kills me!
4968	J.D. Narration	And that's when it happened.
4969	Carla	You should see him prance around when I pretend to let him
4970	Both	Make a decision!
4971	J.D. Narration	That's when Carla realized she was exactly like Turk's mom.
4972	Dr. Kelso	Great job at rounds today, Dr. Reid.
4973	Elliot	Thank you, sir!
4974	Dr. Kelso	Your dad must have been very impressed.
4975	Elliot	I think so. I could tell that he really respected you, sir.
4976	Dr. Kelso	Well, that's very nice, but lucky for me, my self-esteem isn't tied up in that kind of poppycock. You see, I didn't become a doctor to impress my daddy, or anyone else. I did it for me. I've seen lots of doctors who got into this for the wrong reasons. You know what happens to them?
4977	Elliot	No...
4978	Dr. Kelso	They quit and get their real estate license. You look upset, sweetheart. You shouldn't be. I think you'd look super in a gold blazer.
4979	Elliot	Thank you?
4980	Dr. Kelso	This is almost too easy.
4981	Mr. Dorian	Work is great, Johnny. I like to believe that I'm selling dreams.
4982	J.D.	But Dad, you sell office supplies.
4983	Mr. Dorian	Yeah, I prefer to call them dreams. I'm gonna-I'm gonna steal another Jell-o.
4984	J.D. Narration	I always thought parents were like tornadoes.They blow into town and devastate everything in their path.
4985	Elliot	Hi...
4986	J.D.	There's no food on your tray.
4987	Elliot	Oh.
4988	J.D. Narration	But it's different for me.
4989	Mr. Dorian	How you doin', Elliot?Great talk. Uh, anyway, Johnny, I was talking to my buddy Jake this afternoon. You remember my buddy Jake?
4990	J.D.	No.
4991	Mr. Dorian	Well, anwyay, Jake's my buddy and he's leaving the country for who knows how long so I thought I might get out of here tomorrow afternoon and go catch up with him which would mean I'd miss your thing but I wouldn't know what I was hearing anyway. Right?
4992	J.D.	Right!
4993	J.D. Narration	I think what surprised me the most was that I was actually surprised.
4994	Mr. Dorian	You still talking to yourself? I thought you'd outgrow that by now.
4995	J.D. Narration	I probably should have woken him up to say good-bye, considering he'd be gone before I got home. I told myself I wanted to let the old guy get some sleep but even I didn't believe that.
4996	Mrs. Reid	Honey, you keep eating that, there won't be anything left for a man to put a ring on.
4997	Elliot	Mom, I started therapy.
4998	Mrs. Reid	Did you know that Amy Swanson married Drew Gertson? Drew is such a nice boy.
4999	Elliot	Drew used to hold people down and spit into their mouths.
5000	Mrs. Reid	He doesn't do that anymore.
5001	Elliot	Mom, when I was a little girl, did I used to want to be a doctor? Maybe I used a toy stethoscope on one of my dolls?
5002	Mrs. Reid	Oh, honey. You'd have to ask the nanny.
5003	Elliot	Have you ever reached a point in your life when you just really wished you knew how you got there?
5004	Mrs. Reid	Are you trying to tell me you're a lesbian?
5005	Elliot	Yes, I am. Yup. Exactly. Exactly what I'm saying, Mom.
5006	Turk	Yo, J.D., you wanna grab a bite with us tonight after Elliot and I do our presentation?
5007	J.D.	Yeah, I'm not that busy.
5008	Dr. Steadman	Well, if you're not that busy, then you have time to do this discharge summary for me.
5009	J.D.	I meant that later I'm not that busy
5010	Dr. Steadman	Fantastic!
5011	J.D.	Arrrrgh!
5012	Turk	So I told my mom how much you liked that Cuban restaurant downtown and she loves cuban food, so
5013	Carla	I hate that restaurant!
5014	Turk	Wow. So I must have really misunderstood when you said that you loved that place and you wanted to be buried in a vat of their plantains so you could eat you way out.
5015	Carla	See? That's our problem. You don't get me!
5016	Turk	No argument there!
5017	Janitor's father	Hey, hey, hey, hey! You missed a spot right there!
5018	Janitor	You know, lucky for me, Dad, I spend my life making a big circle around this place cleaning up after sick people so tomorrow I'll probably be here around the same time.
5019	Janitor's father	You know that I hate sass! So just drop right down and give me twenty.
5020	Janitor	Dad, that could be fecal matter.
5021	Janitor's father	Make it thirty!
5022	Janitor	Fine.One...
5023	J.D. Narration	What is with parents anyway? Why is it so easy for them to make us feel bad?
5024	Janitor	Three...
5025	Janitor's father	Sound off like you've got a pair!
5026	Janitor	Dad, I don't gotta put up with this
5027	Dr. Cox	Now, you've got to at least try and pace yourself, Newbie, otherwise sure as shootin' you're going to burn out. Come.Oh, I heard the sad sigh, I see your shoulders are slumped, and I'm aware that you have some whiny-ass problem that you want to talk to me about because you probably think it'd be cathartic to get it the hell off your chest but believe me it won't be. What you've got to do, for me, is the healthy thing. Keep all of your feelings bottled up inside where they *so* belong!
5028	J.D.	My dad flaked on me again.
5029	Dr. Cox	I'm sorry, um, you're not on drugs, are you?
5030	J.D.	What? No!
5031	Dr. Cox	Are you in jail? Have you been beaten? Are you malnourished?
5032	J.D.	I skipped lunch but I've been snacking all day.
5033	Dr. Cox	You are, in fact, a perfectly healthy twenty-six-year-old doctor who keeps crying about how horrible his father was.
5034	J.D.	Well, he did some considerable emotional damage, so...
5035	Dr. Cox	Every one of our parents does some considerable emotional damage and from what I've heard it just might be the best part of being a parent. Now, if some guy ever does put a ring on your finger and you're lucky enough to pop out a youngster, I'm sure you'll understand but for now trust me when I tell you that I wouldn't care if today was the first time you ever met your daddy. Because in reality, well, he could have done a much, much worse job. Okay?
5036	Turk	All right, Elliot, at the presentation I was wondering, can I do the ending? Because I really love the ending of our paper.
5037	Elliot	Do you think I'm cut out to be a doctor?
5038	Turk	Okay, fine, you can do the ending. I just want to say, "Thanks, folks! We've been great!"
5039	Elliot	I'm serious. Do you think this is what I really want to do?
5040	Turk	Elliot, I don't know.
5041	Elliot	You can tell me. I can take it.
5042	Turk	No, Elliot, I'm saying I don't know because I really don't know. What the hell is going on here? Why have all women gone crazy?
5043	Elliot	I'm not crazy, am I? No, shhh, it's okay.It's okay, Elliot, you're normal...
5044	Carla	Turk?
5045	Turk	He's not here.
5046	Carla	Turk. I do like that Cuban restaurant.
5047	Turk	Well, I think the important thing is we got through this together.
5048	Carla	I just freaked out because your mom and I have so much in common.
5049	Turk	So?
5050	Carla	I don't know, I got this crazy idea that you only fell for me because I'm just like your mom.
5051	Turk	Aw, baby...That's *exactly* why I fell for you.
5052	Carla	Okay, I'll probably just have a friend pick up my stuff...
5053	Turk	No, wait, sit down. What's wrong with wanting to be with someone because they're smart and independent and always looking out for you? Okay?
5054	Carla	Yeah.
5055	Turk	Okay.
5056	Carla	But if we ever get married, we're gonna have to talk about this in therapy.
5057	Turk	Relax. I don't do this with my mama.
5058	Carla	I hope not.
5059	Turk	Oh, yeah, mama!
5060	Carla	Oh, that's just wrong.
5061	Turk	Oh, mama!
5062	J.D. Narration	Part of me thought Cox was wrong and I had every reason to be angry with my father.
5063	Patient	So... how's it going down there?
5064	J.D.	If it's okay with you, we just won't talk right now. Got a needle. Need to focus.
5065	J.D. Narration	But then I stopped thinking of my dad as a father, and started thinking of him as a man. And I realized some things that deep down I probably always knew. Like, maybe he wasn't crashing on my couch to spend more quality time with me but because he couldn't afford a hotel room.And maybe he wasn't going to see his buddy Jake to catch up, but because Jake was someone he might be able to sell something to and he really needs a sale.And maybe the truth is, he's just a middle-aged lonely guy trying to get by and it sure would be nice if someone would give him a break once and a while.
5066	J.D.	Hey, Dad.
5067	Mr. Dorian	Hey, there he is! I thought you had to work all day.
5068	J.D.	You know, I did, but I got someone to cover for me because I wanted to make sure I caught you and let you know how cool it was to see you.
5069	Mr. Dorian	Really?
5070	J.D.	Yeah.
5071	Mr. Dorian	Well... Well, listen, I, um, you know, I have to travel a lot lately so I'm sure I'll be back in this region again soon. I could swing back out to see you.
5072	J.D.	That would be really great.
5073	Mr. Dorian	Great.
5074	J.D.	Great.
5075	Mr. Dorian	Great. I'd be happy to see you.
5076	J.D.	I see you've been taking advantage of the farting policy.
5077	Mr. Dorian	Hey, pull my finger!
5078	J.D.	I'm not gonna pull your finger!
5079	Mr. Dorian	Pull my finger, see what happens.I pooed a little.
5080	Elliot	Dr. Kelso.
5081	Dr. Kelso	Well, if it isn't daddy's little girl.
5082	Elliot	Dr. Kelso, I just wanted to tell you what happened to me this afternoon.
5083	Dr. Kelso	I'm going to go right ahead and keep eating my soup but you rest assured I'm holding my breath on the inside.
5084	Elliot	First, I came out to my mother.
5085	Dr. Kelso	Well, then it appears the boys down in radiology owe me quite a bit of money.
5086	Elliot	But this afternoon...A patient puked on me... and I smiled.You know why I was smiling? Because I really like what I do. I mean, you were right, I got into this for all the wrong reasons but I lucked out because now that I'm here, I can't imagine being anywhere else.
5087	Dr. Kelso	I still don't like your father!
5088	Elliot	Oh, me neither, sir.Oh, they were all out.Placement of an iliac stent when hemodynamic results of PTA are inadequate or primary stent placement at the initial time of PTA...
5089	J.D. Narration	Maybe the mistake we make is thinking our parents will change.And maybe they did a better job than we give them credit for.And maybe there, amid all the crap they dumped on us, are some things worth keeping. Like a passion for something you never knew you had. Or the ability to constantly surround yourself with people who love you.
5090	Elliot	In conclusion, the difference in the outcome between the two strategies was not significant in either short-term or long-term prognosis.
5091	Turk	Thank you very much, folks. We've been great.
5092	J.D.	And "Z" is for the Zs you'll be getting, now that you know heart murmurs from "A" to "Z."What are you doing here?
5093	Dr. Cox	Yeah, I just figured I'd come down and check it out. You know, see how you were doing. And for the record, that was atrocious. I mean, downright abysmal.
5094	J.D.	I know, but did you see "A" through "K"? 'Cause I did a really cool thing with "A" through "K."
5095	Dr. Cox	Actually, I showed up at "Y." As in, "Why, dear God, why?!"
5096	Janitor's father	You know, this has got to be the most piss-poor sorry excuse for a hospital that I have ever set foot in.
5097	Janitor	Well, Dad, in that case, feel free to not stop by every day that you're in town.
5098	Janitor's father	Good-bye, son.See you tomorrow.
5099	Janitor	Yup.Heh, heh. Parents, huh?
5100	J.D.	Tell me about it.
5101	Janitor	Yeah, what's that, a shot at my dad? That's stepping over the line, pal.
5102	J.D.	I missed this.

5104	Turk	Nothing.... Nothing.... Nothing.... Nothing.... Nothing.... Nothing....
5105	J.D.	I can see!
5106	Turk	Nothing.... Nothing.
5107	J.D.	Come on, man, let's get out of here. There's something to do, there's......film festivals, there's theatre, there's museums. Let's get out and get some culture! How 'bout some of that!
5108	Turk	Let's put Rowdy on top of the TV and see which one of us can throw a hat on him first.
5109	J.D.'s Narration	Turk turns everything in to a competition. It can get kind of annoying.
5110	Turk	Let's play Steak.
5111	J.D.	What?
5112	Turk	Steak: The first person to finish their steak is the winner of Steak.
5113	J.D.	No, see, I paid seventeen dollars for this steak, and I'm not gonna....You want some?
5114	Turk	Uh-huh.Ankles is a simple game: The first one to get embarrassed and pull up their scrubs loses.
5115	J.D.'s Narration	The problem is, these stupid games always seem to end the same way.
5116	Turk	HA! HahahahaHA! Say it!Say it!Just say it.
5117	J.D.	I'm your beeyotch.
5118	Turk	Yes, you are! Now, sit back, baby, 'cause 'Iron Chef' is on.

5120	Turk	I win!
5121	J.D.	I wasn't racing, I was just walking in.
5122	Todd	Good, clean win, T-Dog. Now, let's go down to the Caf and get our doughnut on.
5123	J.D.	It wasn't a race! Okay, fine! Let's just play, uh, let's play Tip Over the Trash-Can! Okay?I win!I...I win.
5124	Janitor	Can I play?
5125	J.D.	Yeah.
5126	Janitor	This is fun.
5127	J.D.	Yeah.

5129	Elliot	Sorry to keep you, Mr. Kelly, I was just, uh....So, what are you, uh...sick or something?
5130	Sean	My my heartbeat, it's like, uh, it's irregular. What's the medical word for it?
5131	Carla	"Irregular."
5132	Sean	Yeah! That's it, it's irregular.
5133	Elliot	Ah! Of course! The heart...the old ticker!
5134	Sean	Wow...you're my doctor. I have something for you in my pants.No. No, no, no, no, no. Not not I'm not wearing any pants...right now. My pants are over there, and there's a note...from my my G.P. in, um, in the pocket.If you guys need me, I'll be under here.
5135	Elliot	This might sound weird, but I'm in love with that guy. And if I don't sleep with him, I'm gonna kill myself! It's inappropriate to jump a patient, isn't it?
5136	Carla	Totally.
5137	Elliot	Have you ever done it?
5138	Carla	Tons of times.
5139	Turk	Tons of times what, Baby?
5140	Carla	Nothing, Baby.
5141	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
5142	Dr. Cox	Why hasn't he had a surgical consult? Oh, you know what, I'm sorry, that's my fault. I didn't make it clear to you how I feel about things that should already be done, so, here it is: I almost always wish things were done already.
5143	J.D.	Look, Mr. Hoffner asked for all his treatment options, and I gave them to him; he never specifically asked for a surgical consult.
5144	Mr. Hoffner	Could I have a surgical consult?
5145	Dr. Cox	You may have whatever you want, there, cowboy.
5146	J.D.	How is that helpful? Do you not get the whole doctor-patient relationship thing? We're supposed to be a team.
5147	Mr. Hoffner	You and me? We're gonna get killed.

5149	Dr. Cox	Oh, for the love of Our Lady of Guadalupe, that is a fine brew.
5150	Nurse	Oh, it's just coffee.
5151	Dr. Cox	Oh, no, no. This is liquid crack; this is a mug full of sunshine; my dear, for me, this is like sex.
5152	Nurse	Oh! Is that why you always finish so quickly?
5153	Dr. Cox	Mmm. And sassy, too. If you could cook a steak, I'd eat it right off your bottom!Oh, ladies! This is that beverage that I've been trying to describe to you. And, it turns out this is gonna sound weird, but the secret is you grind it from beans...not crap.
5154	Nurse Roberts	I'll grind your beans.
5155	Dr. Cox	Oh, Laverne, honestly, when are we gonna get it over with?
5156	Carla	Look, we are already understaffed, and Dr. Kelso just fired two nurses for no good reason, so you will forgive us if we don't have time for The Dr. Cox Show today. Okay?Now, we have to reschedule every single nurse for the week.
5157	Nurse Roberts	Well, I don't understand what we're gonna do about the...
5158	Dr. Cox	We don't need them...do we.
5159	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
5160	J.D.'s Narration	Here's the problem about getting a surgical consult: I think Mr. Hoffner should be treated medically, but any surgeon is gonna want to slice and dice him. You see, surgical and medical interns are kind of like two rival gangs not real gangs, more like those cheesy gangs you see in Broadway musicals.Still, I knew there was one surgical intern I could count on.
5161	J.D.	"If you have some molds, I will inspect them"
5162	Turk	"I'll remove tumors from your brain to your rectum"
5163	Together	"Between the two of us, there is no wall / We're a surgeon and a doc above it all / A surgeon and a doc, above...it...all!"
5164	Turk	No problem, man. Whatever you want me to tell your patient, I'm your guy.

5166	Elliot	How are you feeling?
5167	Sean	Uhh, well, I'm not tired, if that's what you're getting at.
5168	Elliot	Don't get all male on me! Stress tests are supposed to be hard. Um, it helps if you visualize yourself running towards something, like your girlfriend....
5169	Sean	Mm, I don't have a girlfriend.
5170	Elliot	How could you possibly be single?
5171	Sean	I don't know, I mean, I'm kind of anal-neurotic.
5172	Elliot	Oh, my God! Me too!
5173	Sean	Really?
5174	Elliot	Please! I like to keep my pens in order from least to most ink.
5175	Sean	Oh, that is hot. I don't know, I guess the truth is that I, uh, I don't go out a lot, you know? I always seem to put my foot in my mouth.
5176	Elliot	Oh, I'd let you put your foot in my mouth.
5177	Sean	What?
5178	Elliot	Oh, um, I said I'd let you put your foot in my mouth!
5179	Sean	Oh. That's weird.
5180	Elliot	I know!
5181	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
5182	Dr. Kelso	Who gets to tell us the symptoms of Menier's Disease? Dr. Murphy!
5183	Doug	Can you use it in a sentence?
5184	Dr. Cox	Ahhh, sorry to interrupt you, there, Bobbo, but I gotta ask you a quick question. Now, when you were born nay, "spawned" by the Dark Prince himself, did that rat-bastard forget to give you a hug before he sent you along your way? Because you can't just let two good nurses go on account of feeling small and insignificant. And, besides, with your money, you oughtta able to keep a little man tucked away in the closet and bring him out whenever you want to knock him around, huh?As you were.
5185	J.D.	Doug. Look away!
5186	Doug	I...can't!

5188	Mr. Hoffner	What are you serving for dinner tonight?
5189	J.D.	You know, that's not really my area.
5190	Mr. Hoffner	I'd like chicken.
5191	J.D.	Okay, Mr. Hoffner, here's your surgical consult. But, I have to warn you, he's gonna agree with the medical course I set out for you. Now then, Dr. Turk, why don't you tell Mr. Hoffner whether or not you think he should have surgery.
5192	Turk	I think he should have the surgery.
5193	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, the important thing to remember is that we're both professionals, and we should behave as such in front of the patient.
5194	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
5195	Dr. Cox	No! Tell me he did not fire her!
5196	Carla	You had to do it! You had to show up Kelso, and now another nurse is out of a job.
5197	Dr. Cox	Excuse me, I went down there to confront
5198	Carla	I am not done! Am I done?
5199	Nurse Roberts	You don't look done.
5200	Carla	You know what your problem is?
5201	Dr. Cox	There are times I put myself in situ
5202	Carla	Oh, my God! Who answers that question!? You see, _that_ is your problem you think you have the answers to e-heh-everything, but instead, you end up throwing gas on the fire, and everyone else has to pay the consequences.
5203	Dr. Cox	That's almost exactly what I was going to say.
5204	Elliot	Carla, um, I'm sorry, can I talk to you for a second?
5205	Dr. Cox	Oh, my God Barbie needs you!
5206	Carla	To be continued.
5207	Dr. Cox	Whoo.
5208	Elliot	Why hasn't he asked me out? I mean, he knows I'm single, I've mentioned, like, five movies that I want to see, I I even keep dropping things so that when I pick them up he can see how flexible I am!
5209	Carla	Look, Elliot, you have to understand, these things take time and self-respect...so we're gonna focus on time.
5210	Elliot	That's a good point. I mean, nobody likes me when they first meet me and
5211	Carla	Exactly!I'm helping.
5212	Elliot	'Kay. I mean, we've got all the time in the world, right?
5213	Carla	Right.
5214	Elliot	Oh, no.
5215	Sean	Oh, I knew it. I'm dying. I was exhausted the whole time I was on that treadmill! I should have said something; but I never do, nope. I mean, not when it comes to my well-being. And now...I'm getting a pig heart!
5216	Elliot	No, you're perfect.... You're free to go...today.
5217	Sean	That seems like good news?
5218	Elliot	Best news ever!Oh! Dropped my clip-board! I'll just....

5221	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
5222	J.D.	You said you were gonna back me up!
5223	Turk	That was before I looked at his chart. He's had ulcerative colitis for the past ten years.
5224	Mr. Hoffner	And no girlfriends. It's a...gassy disease.
5225	J.D.	You can't consider this a reoccurrence! He was under-treated last time!
5226	Turk	He's high-risk for colon cancer!
5227	J.D.	That's why we're gonna give him frequent colonoscopies!
5228	Mr. Hoffner	How frequent?
5229	J.D.	I can't believe you're turning this into a competition. Luckily, it's not up to you it's up to Mr. Hoffner.
5230	Mr. Hoffner	I'm gonna go with surgery.
5231	J.D.	You're getting a meat plate for dinner!
5232	Mr. Hoffner	But I eat chicken!
5233	Turk	I'll set it up.
5234	Together	"A surgeon and a doc, above...it...all!"
5235	J.D.	Aaaaaaaaaaaagggggggghhhhhhhhhh!

5241	Dr. Cox	Oh, it's okay, Jumbo; it's okay! Now, who's my big boy? Oh, who's my big boy!
5242	J.D.	I AM!

5248	Nurse Roberts	Grab these.
5249	Dr. Cox	Rough all over. So don't talk to me, Joanie, just go talk to your patient. Go!
5250	J.D.	What's up, Benedict.
5251	Turk	What?
5252	J.D.	Benedict Arnold?
5253	Turk	That's just the lamest smack-talk I've ever heard in my life.
5254	J.D.	Oh yeah?
5255	Turk	Yeah.
5256	J.D.	Well, that's not what the red-coats thought!
5257	Mr. Hoffner	Wow! You went Colonial on his ass!
5258	J.D.	So, what's up, man? You're gonna go under the knife just 'cause that guy told you to?
5259	Mr. Hoffner	No, I spoke to some other people.
5260	J.D.	Like who?

5268	Dr. Cox	Lookit, you fired a dear, dear friend of mine. That woman was like family!
5269	Dr. Kelso	Who?
5270	Dr. Cox	Who? I'll tell you who! ....Coffee Nurse. When you fired Coffee Nurse, you made this whole thing personal!
5271	Dr. Kelso	No, you made it personal. You gave me all that lip yesterday in front of the interns. Look, you wanna know why I laid off those first two nurses? Budgetary constraints forced a cut, and those two had negative reports. And you think I did it to make myself happy...heh-heh.... I wouldn't notice if they all caught on fire.
5272	Dr. Cox	Well, then, why in God's name did you axe Coffee Nurse?
5273	Dr. Kelso	Because you were being an ass! You're right that was personal. My bad!Golly, I do love moist cake.

5277	Carla	No! Do you need me to ice up your nipples?

5299	Dr. Cox	I just wanted to say that I'm.......I'm sorry.
5300	Dr. Kelso	Holy crap!
5301	Dr. Cox	But my bad behavior is my own doing, and I don't think an innocent nurse should suffer on account of it.
5302	Dr. Kelso	Then I'll make it right.
5303	Dr. Cox	Thank you.
5304	Dr. Kelso	If...you will apologize again so the interns can hear. Your call, Perry.
5305	Dr. Cox	Dr. Kelso.... I'm sorry. I was wrong.

5312	Elliot	At one point I tried changing the subject to art.... But, we went from art to artists to alcohol to coffee...and that just led right back to poo!
5313	Carla	Elliot, you know how they say no one will ever love you until you learn to love yourself?
5314	Elliot	My mother used to say, "No one will ever love you."
5315	Carla	Just fake it! Don't let him see what a neurotic mess you are. You see Turk over there?
5316	Turk	Hey!
5317	Carla	He doesn't know that I cry sometimes because I'm not sure there's a cat heaven.It's all about hiding the crazy and _acting_ like the most confident girl in the room.
5318	Elliot	No problem!
5319	J.D.'s Narration	I, too, decided it was time to act like the most confident girl in the room, and face things head-on.
5320	J.D.	That was my patient, Turk! I brought you in as my friend, and you're so damn competitive you just go ahead and take him from me? That sucks!
5321	Turk	Tough.
5322	J.D.	Excuse me?
5323	Turk	You're damn right I'm competitive. See, that's what makes me a good doctor I want to win at everything every day, and you should, too.
5324	J.D.	Oh, you know, that sounds like a great friendship.
5325	Turk	Dude, if you don't wanna play Steak again, that's fine, all right? This has nothing to do with friendship, and you know it! So stop blaming me, because the truth is you're angry at yourself 'cause you couldn't get the guy to believe in you!
5326	J.D.	He never got the concept of the team.

5357	Carla	You two are perfect for each other.
5358	Elliot	WOO! I got a date. I got a date.
5359	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, sometimes, your ego leads you into battles you can't possibly win.And sometimes, you have to admit that feeling competitive isn't a bad thing. Because, if you truly believe you're right, you have to be willing to fight for it.
5360	J.D.	Listen, I know what I'm telling you is the right way to go, and I am not gonna take "no" for an answer. So, what do you say?
5361	Patient	Okay, let's do it.
5362	Janitor	You won. Now beat it.
5363	J.D.	What?
5364	Janitor	Go.Let's get you some sherbet!
5365	J.D.'s Narration	Bottom line, when the stakes are high, you have to go for the win. You know, as long as you don't get caught up in the petty stuff.

5374	Elliot	Really kinky? Was I...a bad girl?
5375	Sean	Very bad. You had to go to the principal's office.
5376	Elliot	Ohhh.Mmm...I have an early shift tomorrow morning I've gotta get some sleep.
5377	Sean	You want me to take you home?
5378	Elliot	No. But, if we're gonna pick up a school girl outfit _and_ have sex, we have to leave this minute.
5379	Sean	Yep. Right.
5380	J.D.'s Narration	One of the best things about women is that they're so unpredictable. Of course, that can really bite you in the ass.
5381	Carla	Boink. Who's your new friend?
5382	J.D.	Look! It's got a letter!
5383	Turk	Okay, fine, so I've put on a few pounds. But how would you like it if somebody did this to you?
5384	Carla	Oh, I wouldn't!
5385	Turk	I just don't think it's fair.
5386	Carla	It isn't fair. Now eat your doughnut.

5396	Carla	Who wouldn't be nice to you right now?
5397	Dr. Kelso	Hello! Dr. Dorian, I understand you might need a refresher course in hospital safety. This is a syringe. When filled with infected blood, where is the last place you might want to stick it?

5402	J.D.	What's this?
5403	Lawyer	If you should develop any symptoms that suggest you may have contracted Hepatitis B, this form simply states the hospital is not responsible.
5404	J.D.	Thanks. That's, uh, that's comforting.

5414	J.D.	What? It's my "Elliot Got Some Booty" dance.Oh, come on! Elliot, it's not like anybody else knows.

5422	J.D.'s Narration	The curse of the scrubs machine one of the hospital's most annoying money savers. The only way to get clean scrubs out is to put dirty ones in.
5423	J.D.	How can I help?
5424	Elliot	Give me your shirt.

5435	Turk	No, careful. I just might eat you.
5436	Carla	Turk, I see it all the time the long hours, the stress eating, no exercise there's not a doctor here who's in shape.

5443	Man 3	And make sure you check for urinary Legionella antigen.
5444	Man 4	I don't know...it could be viral, considering my gastro-intestinal situation.
5445	Man 3	Here comes the fart joke!
5446	Man 4	No, no, no, really! I think I may have Strep pneumo!
5447	Man 1	All four of us are doctors.

5449	Man 2	Medical convention.
5450	Man 1	So, junior, what's with the antecubital veinal puncture?
5451	J.D.	Oh, I got hit with the business end of one of my Hep-B patients' syringes last night.
5452	Man 1	I once had a colleague who got bit by a patient with rabies.
5453	J.D.	He's okay, right?
5454	Man 1	No, he died.
5455	Man 3	A friend of mine from med school contracted leprosy. They had to amputate one if his toes just popped it right off!
5456	Man 2	Oh, but Hepatitis! Scary stuff.
5457	J.D.	Well, I'll I'll be okay.
5458	Man 4	Ohhh...maybe!

5465	Sean	Elliot, don't always assume that I want to be fooling around. Sometimes I'm I'm perfectly happy just being with you and thinking about fooling around.
5466	Elliot	Why can't couples these days just _be_ together? You know?
5467	Sean	Why is it always about sex?
5468	Elliot	Yes! Sean, yes.
5469	Seam	You know, Freud said that ninety percent of all human behavior is motivated by sexual impulses? But, come on. You know, give me some credit. I'd say at least thirty percent of my behavior is motivated by advertising, and the rest by violence in film!
5470	Elliot	For me it's ninety-eight percent getting my dad to love me, two percent chocolate.
5471	Sean	Aha....

5482	Turk	Todd.
5483	Todd	Cool!
5484	Turk	So, how do you do it, man? How do you stay in shape?
5485	Dr. Cox	It's called discipline. Some of us work on our appearance.
5486	Turk	Well, you think it's possible that I could work out with you sometime?
5487	Dr. Cox	I don't know about that, stay-puff. I'm not particularly fond of you. Although, it might be fun to see you flail about for a couple of days.

5494	Mr. Winston	I don't have anyone to talk to.
5495	J.D.	Good news, friend. The doctor is in!
5496	Mr. Winston	I asked for a newspaper, and they gave me a bunch of Judy Bloom books from Pediatrics.
5497	J.D.	I don't know anything about those.You have to read "Tales of the Fourth Grade Nothing" completely turned high school around for me!
5498	J.D.'s Thoughts	You see, nobody keeps John Dorian from moving on. Nobody!
5499	Janitor	We've secretly replaced this doctor's blood with Hepatitis blood. Let's see if he notices!
5500	J.D.	You know, I could be really sick here! Could you be nice for once in your life?
5501	Janitor	How's that?
5502	Elliot	I have not been this happy since...well...ever! Don't you think Sean and I are such a great couple?
5503	Dr. Simotes	I don't know who Sean is, and you've never spoken to me before.
5504	Elliot	We just...we just click on every level, you know? God, and the sex! Oh!
5505	Dr. Simotes	Hi, my name is V.J.!
5506	Dr. Kelso	Let's see who's on their game today and start off with a simple case of Pheochromocytoma. What is the initial test of choice, Dr. Reid?
5507	Elliot	24-hour urinary metanephrine?
5508	Dr. Kelso	Right-o! And what is your pre-operative treatment?
5509	Elliot	ACE inhibitors!
5510	Dr. Kelso	Wrong-o! Why don't you attempt to crawl out of your little shame hole, Dr. Reid, and tell me the etiology of hypercalcemia in sarcoidosis.Gutter ball! Dr. Reid, yesterday you were running around my hospital half naked
5511	Dr. Simotes	Yeah, baby.
5512	Dr. Kelso	today, you're mucking up my rounds! Is your ponytail too tight? Perhaps you have a mild case of the boogie-woogie flu? Something is different; because you, my dear, are slipping. Next patient.

5517	Turk	You should give speeches to teenage girls!

5624	Sean	Well, I'm big on forgiving people who look like they're about to kiss me.
5625	Elliot	Ugh, the work never ends, you know? I mean, every day I have to be ready for rounds, I have to take care of patients, I have scut work and research papers due.... Plus I'm starting a new rotation, and if my internship does not got well this year then there's no way I'm getting a good residency next year; and without the residency, there goes my fellowship. And I know that that doesn't leave a lot of time for us. So, on some level, I think that maybe we should make this more casual. But, come on, I mean, I know I could never be casual with you.... We'd just end up here again, right?
5626	Sean	So, what are you saying?
5627	Elliot	I don't know.
5628	Sean	Then why are you saying it?
5629	Elliot	Oh, my God. I th ...I think I'm saying that I can't make this work right now.

5631	Elliot	Sean, you don't understand how hard it was for me just to get to this point. I mean, if I don't do the very best that I can, I'm gonna hate myself forever.
5632	Sean	What is this obsession with being the best, huh? I mean, what is what is so bad about being adequate? That's what I do.
5633	Elliot	No.... You don't....

5635	Elliot	I have to go back in. Um....

5642	Dr. Cox	Because you asked me to. Oh, and because of your puppy-dog eyes.
5643	J.D.	No, see, you're full of it you knew I was scared, why didn't you just tell me to go in there and deal with it?
5644	Dr. Cox	Well, gosh, Newbie, I don't know what it was about that day. Maybe I hadn't had enough sleep. Maybe my mind was on other things. Maybe I didn't have enough fiber in my diet, and I failed to do my morning business. I don't know what the hell it was, but the bottom line is I didn't feel like spelling it out for you. And I know, I know, you want your little speech, and that's fine because here it is: You're a doctor. You might get sick. Get over it.
5645	J.D.	Thank you. Now, can I have my patient back?
5646	Dr. Cox	No. Because, aside from his weird Judy Bloom obsession, I like him. You will be de-lousing Mr. Schaffer guy's like fly-paper!

5707	J.D.	Ooh!
5708	Ben	When they're posed, they're not real. You know, I hate that whole, like, "gneen!" thing. That's why, at a party, you'll see me in the bushes with my camera.
5709	J.D.	You're a little weird, aren't you.
5710	Ben	Just a little bit.
5711	Dr. Cox	Hey, Ben, look what the cat tried to drag in right before it was skinned and eaten.
5712	Ben	"Eeh!"
5713	Jordan	You're still with the annoying camera?
5714	Ben	Do you just skip the whole part where people say hello to each other?
5715	Jordan	Hello, Benji. You look very pale.
5716	Ben	I miss the sweet talk!
5717	Jordan	Maybe it's been too long. Maybe my feelings were hurt a little bit.
5718	Dr. Cox	"Feelings." That's a good one.
5719	Ben	Jordan, you're a big girl now. When you got the divorce, you put people in the awkward position of having to choose between you and Perry.
5720	Jordan	Y-you're my brother!

5725	Surgeon	Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop, stop.I'm guessing Mr. Weinberg is Jewish?

5729	J.D.'s Narration	A recent medical study found that a mistake is made on about twenty percent of all patients. Most of these are clerical and harmless, but, it still adds up to a lot of near misses.

5738	Jill	Oh! Which one!?
5739	Elliot	Ohh.... Ooh!So, what's new?
5740	Jill	The last time I saw you, I was really stressed out you know, the weight of the world on my shoulders.... So guess what I did.
5741	Elliot	Quit your job!
5742	Jill	Flushed my fish down the toilet! No more feedings, no more cleaning the bowl.... No more being judged for having a second glass of wine
5743	Elliot	Oh, don't even get me started on judgmental fish!
5744	Jill	Uh-huh. But then _that_ sent me on this whole shame spiral, so I decided to travel. I got hit on in Venice! I climbed Mount Kilimanjaro! ...For about ten minutes it's very, very steep.... And _then_ I went to Florida to swim with the Dolphins!
5745	Elliot	Ohhhhh....
5746	Jill	And I don't mean the fish! There was an NFL thing going on at the hotel!
5747	Elliot	Oh, you!
5748	Jill	Oh, I almost forgot! I'm engaged!Oh, right.... There used to be a ring there, but then my, uh, fiancé did some soul-searching, and we decided that it needed to be a...little more fancy.
5749	Elliot	Oh, you have no idea how happy this makes me! I've been trying to figure out how to tell you the only reason you're vomiting and exhausted is...well...you're pregnant!
5750	Jill	I'm what, now?
5751	Elliot	Yeah, pregnant! Your fiancé is gonna be so happy!
5752	Jill	My fiancé and I decided not to have sex until we were married.

5758	J.D.	You know, we don't it says it right there on the box.
5759	Ben	Yeah, see; look right there. Hey, don't be mean to him. You're mad at me.
5760	Jordan	Yeah, because you shouldn't be doing contracting work. You. Are. Clumsy! That's why things like this keep happening.
5761	Ben	They don't keep happening.
5762	Jordan	How many times have you hurt yourself with that nail-gun?
5763	Ben	Once.
5764	Jordan	Oh, come on.
5765	Ben	What? With that nail-gun? It's a new nail-gun. If it'd been any other nail-gun, then, yeah, the estimate would be slightly higher.
5766	Jordan	It's not funny!
5767	Ben	You're pretty when you're mad.
5768	Jordan	Ugh, you're so...
5769	J.D.'s Narration	I guess sibling rivalry never goes away. No matter how old you get.
5770	Ben	What is this? That doesn't hurt.
5771	Jordan	Mm-hmm.
5772	Ben	Do'n't hurt. Do'n't hurt.
5773	Jordan	Oh, really?
5774	Ben	Okay, it...kinda smarts a little bit.Jordan, I'll call you later, all right?
5775	Jordan	Okay, fine. Forget it. Forget it.You big jerk!

5781	J.D.	Yeah, we were....
5782	Dr. Cox	Hey, Ben, you realize we haven't grabbed a beer in a couple of weeks what's that about?
5783	J.D.'s Thoughts	You know, he's never asked me to grab a beer. But I don't care....
5784	Dr. Cox	Newbie? Would you like to come?
5785	J.D.	Oh, God, yes.To buddies!
5786	Dr. Cox	What in the hell do you think you're doing!? You can't drink beer, you're our driver! That's why we brought you to begin with.

5794	Turk	Like it matters.
5795	Todd	Oh, it matters!
5796	Dr. Kelso	Bye, Todd.
5797	Todd	Okay!
5798	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Turk, I heard about your mishap earlier today, but here's the skinny: If that patient finds out what happened because you can't reign in your yapper, then heads are going to roll. And I promise you yours and Ted's will be the first to go!
5799	Lawyer	What did I do?
5800	Turk	Consider my lips sewn shut, sir. Which, in this hospital, could actually happen!
5801	Dr. Kelso	Young man! At Sacred Heart, we _do_ _not_ make mistakes!
5802	Elliot	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

5804	Elliot	no! No! No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Stop! Take the phone...!
5805	Jill	Hold on one second. Ho ho hold on!Hi!
5806	Elliot	Hi! Your last name is Tracy! Well, of course, you know your last name is Tracy, but what you don't know is there's a woman down in 308 whose _first_ name is Tracy. So I started thinking about your urine sample, and how you always carry that water bottle with you and stay very well-hydrated which is why your pee is a much lighter color than most people's pee. And then I remembered the sample that came back with your name on it was bright yellow and the other Tracy she is not much of a water drinker...which is why I think her skin looks so pasty
5807	Jill	Okay, sweetie, I'ma need you to get to the point.
5808	Elliot	You're not pregnant! The lab tech just switched the samples!
5809	Jill	You're killin' me.... Hey, Sweetie! You know I was just jokin' about all that stuff, right?

5819	Dr. Cox	Uh-huh.

5826	Dr. Cox	All right, Clara, you can go ahead and order yourself a Cosmopolitan; we'll just grab a cab home.
5827	J.D.	Actually, Ben has been sneaking me beers all night, and I'm quite drunk.
5828	Dr. Cox	Well, that's just great.Hey, Ben, what...why is this hand still bleeding?
5829	Ben	I dunno. Sorta weird, 'cause I cut myself shaving last week and it wouldn't stop bleeding.
5830	J.D.'s Narration	One of the things that sucks about being a doctor is that you never miss a red flag.
5831	Dr. Cox	Could I have you over here for two seconds, just

But if a clerical error is the reason why a guy's walking around here with only the lonely?Well, damn! That don't sit well with the Big Dog!
5842	J.D.	I'm with you, Big Dog.
5843	J.D.'s Narration	I was paged because Ben's blood-work was finally ready. Unfortunately, the chart wasn't in the out-box. I'd knock, but the hematopathologist is the meanest, intern-hatingest monster in this hospital.

6018	Ben	I think you got yourself a Christmas card right there.
6019	Jordan	Yeah, you're funny. Look, I don't understand why you refuse to put on a hospital gown.
6020	Ben	Because I don't like people to see my bum.
6021	Jordan	So wear underwear.
6022	Ben	You know how I feel about underwear.
6023	Jordan	Every girl who came to our house in the mid-eighties knows how you feel about underwear.
6024	Ben	Ha ha, the sweatpants years.
6025	J.D.	I don't like that much freedom down there. Makes me tingle in my giblets.
6026	Jordan	I swear, if you don't start taking this seriously...
6027	J.D. Narration	I'm a good intern, but when you're dealing with disease and family, an intern just doesn't cut it. What you need......Is a hero.
6028	Dr. Cox	Shut up. Shut up. And definitely shut up.
6029	J.D.	But I didn't even say anything.
6030	Dr. Cox	I know, but I enjoy saying it to you. Okay, here's the deal. If we're gonna beat this thing, and we damn sure are, we're gonna do it one way and one way only. We're gonna be a team! We're gonna be a team, team, team, team, team! You hear me?
6031	J.D.	I hear you, Dr. Cox!
6032	Dr. Cox	I am so not speaking to you, Rhonda, thank you!
6033	J.D.	I'm sorry. I got very excited. Go! Heh.
6034	Dr. Cox	What do you say, children? Are we a team?
6035	Jordan	I'm in.
6036	Ben	Go, Team Cancer!
6037	J.D.'s Thoughts	Wow. He did it!
6038	Dr. Cox	I've got to go take care of some other patients.
6039	Turk	I don't believe this! I didn't get tomorrow's whipple procedure!
6040	Carla	I know, I know.
6041	Turk	This is ridiculous!
6042	Carla	Baby, calm down.
6043	Turk	What's a brother gotta do to get a whipple around here, huh? What's a brother gotta do? Tell me! What do I gotta do to get a whipple around here?
6044	Carla	Listen to me! You gotta stop turning your medical training into some ego-driven contest. No one else is doing that.
6045	Bonnie	Oh, I got the whipple. Suck it, Turk.
6046	Carla	I will end her!
6047	Turk	No, no.
6048	Todd	Dude, dude, let her go. It'll be so hot!
6049	Dr. Kelso	Can you tell me the treatment regiment for organophosphate toxicity, Dr. Reid?
6050	Elliot	Well, first I would give intramuscular epinephrine, then IV calcium gluconate followed by emergency hemodialysis.
6051	Dr. Kelso	Sweetheart, if I wanted you to give me three wrong answers in a row, I'd just ask for the usual. Dr. Murphy, care to jump in?
6052	Doug	Um, I think it's
6053	Dr. Kelso	Do you have a speech impedement, sport?
6054	Doug	Excuse me?
6055	Dr. Kelso	You insist on starting every answer with "Um..." so I figure you've either got a speech impedement or you're a stammering know-nothing who doesn't belong in medicine!
6056	Doug	Um
6057	Dr. Kelso	Well spoken. Now, get out. All of you. Get out! Get out! Out, out, out!Jumpin' Jupiter, I do enjoy the tough love.
6058	Dr. Cox	They probably like it, there, too, Bob, whether they admit it or not.
6059	Dr. Kelso	Well...
6060	Dr. Cox	"Oh, the old guy's so tough on me, but I love him!" Riiiight, riiiight? They hate you, Bob. They hate you from the bottom of your hooves to the top of your pitchfork. They hate you, dear God, they hate you good.
6061	Dr. Kelso	What are you laughing at?
6062	Nurse Roberts	That hooves and pitchfork part. Why?
6063	Dr. Kelso	No reason.
6064	Dr. Cox	Now, do you think you can make Ben behave like a patient or not?
6065	J.D.	No problem!Uh... got him to put his gown on.
6066	Ben	He sure did! And now my butt itches on account of this scratchy chair. What are we watching?
6067	Dr. Cox	"Wings." And shut up, I like the cab driver. He... slays me.
6068	J.D.	Antonio played by the actor Tony Shalhoub. Also particularly fantastic in a film called "Big Night.""
6069	Dr. Cox	Congratulations! Your Dimaggio-like streak for saying nothing even remotely interesting is still alive and well!
6070	J.D. Narration	I didn't care about the abuse. The most amazing thing for me was to watch how Dr. Cox dealt with his friend. How he made him feel safe.
6071	Ben	Do I have to get a special doctor?
6072	Dr. Cox	An oncologist. Do we have to talk about this? There must be something else on your mind.
6073	Ben	Nope. Just pretty much that leukemia thing.
6074	Dr. Cox	Ben, leukemia is a petty, ugly illness and we'll not dignify it by speaking of it unless absolutely necessary. Is that clear to you?
6075	Ben	Gotcha.
6076	J.D.	You are such a stud!
6077	Ben	That was interesting.
6078	Turk	So, uh, Dr. Wen, you asked Bonnie to assist you with this whipple procedure?
6079	Dr. Wen	Yes, I did.
6080	Bonnie	Thanks again, sir!
6081	Carla	I guess we should just let it go. I mean, neither one of us wants to do anything to make it worse, right?
6082	Turk	You guys ever notice how you're both Asian?
6083	Janitor	Your mother's maiden name is Turner.
6084	J.D.	So you used your key to get into my personnel file. Big deal.
6085	Janitor	Your first kiss was with Sarah Briggs at the embarrassing age of sixteen. She wore a green turtleneck, and you wonder sometimes if she still thinks about you. I'm guessing no.
6086	J.D.	How could you possibly know that?
6087	Janitor	I'm your father.
6088	Ted	Morning, Dr. Dorian.
6089	J.D.	Ted, you probably don't notice it yourself, but this hospital is a freak show!
6090	Ted	This is my band. We're all working from different departments in the hospital. Leg-al...
6091	Singer 1	Acc-ounting...
6092	Singer 2	Shipping and receiving...
6093	Singer 3	Online property management including pest control, nighttime security and non-arboreal garden serv-ices...
6094	All	Hmmmm-mmm!
6095	J.D.	That's that's just great.
6096	Ted	We mostly do acappella versions of cartoon theme songs.
6097	All	Here he comes! / Here comes Speedracer! / He's a demon on wheels!
6098	Ted	Turn, turn, turn, turn.
6099	All	He's a demon and he's gonna be a chasin' after someone!
6100	Ted	That's good, let's do it again.
6101	Muffled singing	Here he comes! / Here comes Speedracer! He's a demon on wheels...
6102	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Reid! I hope I wasn't too hard on you on rounds this morning.
6103	Elliot	Oh, it's okay, sir. I don't hate myself much more than I usually do!
6104	Dr. Kelso	Well, turnabout's fair play and all that, so here's an evaluation form. I figured I'd try to get get a read on how all you interns think I'm doing. Don't sign your name, it's completely anonymous. And Dr. Reid? I'm no she-doc, I can take it!
6105	Carla	Ah ha ha ha! Whoo! You're gonna crush him, right?
6106	Elliot	Oh, yes. How do you spell inadequate?
6107	Carla	Give me that. I'll fill it out for you.
6108	Dr. Zeltzer	So, Mr. Sullivan, your blast percentage is quite a bit higher than we all expected. Around eighty percent.
6109	Ben	That's bad, right? You want the number to be low, huh? Like in, uh, golf?
6110	Dr. Zeltzer	Yes, exactly. Like in golf. Do you do you play?
6111	Jordan	Oh, who the hell cares if he plays golf?!
6112	Dr. Zeltzer	Uh, I was bonding.
6113	Ben	Hey, doing a good job, too.
6114	Dr. Zeltzer	Thanks.
6115	Jordan	Who is this clown?
6116	Dr. Cox	Paul here is the best oncologist in the room so why don't we all clam up and listen?
6117	Dr. Zeltzer	Uh, we need to start chemo.
6118	Ben	When?
6119	Dr. Zeltzer	This afternoon.
6120	Ben	I'm afraid this afternoon isn't going to work for me. Ironically, I have a golf game to get to.
6121	Dr. Cox	Hey, Benji, don't sweat it. Come on, give me a break.
6122	Ben	Hey, you gonna be there?
6123	Dr. Cox	Um, I got about a thousand patients to look after so, no, I'm probably going to miss this first one. But I will leave my lovely and talented assistant Kimmy.
6124	Ben	Yeah, sure. You know. Okay.
6125	Dr. Zeltzer	Oh, uh, am I Kimmy?
6126	J.D.	No, I'm Kimmy!
6127	Dr. Zeltzer	Oh. Good.
6128	Elliot	I'm telling you, Carla torched Dr. Kelso for me.
6129	Carla	No matter what I wrote down, I always brought it back to sexual inadequacy.
6130	Elliot	So good!
6131	Doug	Hello, ladies.
6132	Elliot	Hey, Doug!
6133	Carla	Hey, Doug.
6134	Elliot	What'd you write on Kelso's evaluation?
6135	Doug	What evaluation?
6136	Elliot	You didn't get yours yet?
6137	Doug	Nobody got one.
6138	J.D. Narration	Around here, bad news always comes back to haunt you.
6139	Turk	Dr. Wen, I just want to take this opportunity to once again apologize to you, and the entire Asian community.
6140	Dr. Wen	I'll pass it on at the next big meeting. You know, Christopher, surgeons don't have to be shallow, rank-obsessed cliches.
6141	Turk	So, who's the best surgery intern? Is it Bonnie? Is it me? I just I gotta know.
6142	Todd	The periampullary carcinoma patient had a failed palliatitive stenting of the common bile duct so this is what I want to do. I want to go ahead and prep him for a pyloris sparing pancreaticoduodenectomy. Thanks.What's up, T-Man?! Show The Todd some love!
6143	J.D.	Dr. Cox, Ben seemed pretty down after you left so I thought I could cover for you and you could go hang out with him.
6144	Dr. Cox	Well, you're just an absolute lamb but you don't have to do that.
6145	J.D.	Oh, I don't mind, I just
6146	Dr. Cox	Newbie, stop!
6147	J.D. Narration	It's funny how people handle bad news in different ways.Some people have a visceral reaction...
6148	Todd	Time to get my soapy soap on!
6149	J.D. Narration	Some people go into denial...
6150	Turk	No way.
6151	J.D. Narration	And others...
6152	Dr. Cox	What chance do you give a guy with Ben's blast percentage, huh? Twenty percent, thirty, maybe? You see, I can't handle that. I cannot. So, no thank you there, Johnny.
6153	J.D. Narration	...Others just walk away.Chemotherapy looks harmless, but it's really poison pumped directly into your veins.
6154	Ben	You know, every time I got sick when I was a kid, Mom would get me a Tonka truck.
6155	Jordan	Yeah, so?
6156	Ben	So where's my Tonka truck?Ha ha! Score!
6157	J.D.	The Earth Mover! Can I see?
6158	Ben	No! See with your eyes, man. Not your hands. Seeee?
6159	Jordan	I can't believe Perry bailed on you. Typical. He's always out the door if things get too real.
6160	J.D.	This is the true story...
6161	Ben	Truuuue storrrayyyy!
6162	Jordan	Of four people forced to hang out in a hospital!
6163	Ben	To find out what happens when people stop being polite...
6164	Jordan	Awwww!
6165	Dr. Cox	And start being realllll!
6166	J.D.	He didn't bail.
6167	Ben	If he did, he's a total wuss.
6168	Elliot	Sir, you said you were giving evaluations to all the interns.
6169	Dr. Kelso	Well, not at the same time, sweetheart. With your way there would be no accountability. No back and forth. You wouldn't have to explain to me why... let's see... "I'm most likely frustrated because I haven't gotten any since the bay of pigs."
6170	Elliot	Sir, I'm so sorry. Are we cool?
6171	Dr. Kelso	What could possibly have possessed you to write such filth!
6172	Carla	Uh, Dr. Kelso? I need to tell you something.
6173	Elliot	That's okay, Carla, I'm going to take care of that patient. Dr. Kelso, I did it because I didn't think you'd know it was me and I thought that it would be funny.
6174	Dr. Kelso	Let's take a walk. I'd like to tell you a few things that I think are funny.
6175	Turk	Come on. How could this guy be the best?
6176	Dr. Wen	You want to know the difference between you two? When you're working, I can always see your wheels turning. You're thinking about what you have to do next, what could go wrong. You're not in the moment. As much as it pains me to say it... The Todd is.
6177	Turk's Thoughts	Please! Just because I'm thorough and I want to keep two kelly clamps on the field in case their appendiceal artery is inadvertently incised so I can gain immediate hemostatic control doesn't mean I think too much. Plus, what if I needed to...
6178	Todd's Thoughts	Dum de dum dum dum shiny scalpel... dum de dum dum dum gonna slice him up...
6179	Janitor	You're afraid of escalators.
6180	J.D.	That's not uncommon.
6181	Janitor	You like the way cashmere feels on your skin!
6182	J.D.	How are you doing this?
6183	Janitor	That's right! You run away! Run away from the truth!
6184	J.D.	Look, Dr. Cox, I've been doing a lot of thinking and I honestly think that the only reason you're not down at that hospital right now is that you're afraid.
6185	Dr. Cox	I think you're right. I do. Partly because you've really... gotten to know me this year.But mostly it's because, well... I told you that I was afraid earlier today so please don't tell me that you've come here to reiterate things to me that I've already said because I know the things I've already said. In fact... I'm the one who said them.
6186	J.D.	You gotta get back in the game, Coxie!Okay, Coxie was a mistake. Pretend I didn't say Coxie.
6187	Dr. Cox	Geeeet out.
6188	J.D.	Look, it boggles my mind that you just bail on a patient!
6189	Dr. Cox	No. A patient is a stranger in a bed that you can distance yourself from whenever you need to. Ben is my friend and I'm going to try to get in there to visit him in the next couple of weeks but if I can't... that'll be very sad for me. But really... it will just mean that I'm human. Oh, and newbie? Please don't think that you have come here because Ben needs me. You're here because you're scared to death that you might have to rely on yourself for the first time ever and that... that is just the saddest thing of all.
6190	J.D. Narration	I think one of the most universal human experiences is feeling alone. You'd never know it, but there's most likely tons of people feeling the exact same way.Maybe because you're feeling abandoned.Maybe because you realize that you aren't as self-sufficient as you thought.Maybe because you know you should've handled something differently.Or maybe because you aren't as good as you thought you were. Either way, when you hit that low point, you have a choice. You can either wallow in self-pity......Or you can suck it up. It's your call.
6191	Turk	You know what, Dr. Wen? I don't care if I'm not the best right now because I'm all about the upside and one day, I'm going to own this place. That's right. All of this right here, all of this right here is gonna be the Chris Turk Wing.
6192	Carla	Dr. Kelso, I wrote that evaluation. It was me. Elliot didn't write a word.
6193	Elliot	But I would've written every single word if I had the courage! And the other side of the tracks upbringing that Carla did! Because you know what I think of you?
6194	Carla	You tell him!
6195	Elliot	You're mean.
6196	J.D. Narration	As for me, I decided that if Dr. Cox couldn't do it, well then I would have to be the one there for Ben.
6197	All	Bum bum bum... when criminals in this world appear and break the laws that they should fear / And frighten all who see or hear / The cry goes up both far and near / For Underdog! / Underdog / Underdog / Underdog / Speed of light, roar of thunder / Fight all who rob or plunder / Underdog! / Ahhhh! Underdog! Underdog!
6198	J.D.	Well, thank God.
6199	Dr. Cox	Good-bye, newbie.So, uh... you know, what's up?
6200	Ben	You know, this and that. Hey, I met someone.
6201	Dr. Cox	Really?
6202	Ben	Yes. Well, she took a stool sample so I think she works here. Uh, redhead? Uh, tall?
6203	Dr. Cox	Not on the staff, no.
6204	Ben	No? Strange young lady.
6205	Dr. Cox	Are we just gonna sit around here and make jokes all day? Is that the drill?
6206	Ben	If it makes you uncomfortable, then you can just bolt again.
6207	Dr. Cox	I think it's only fair that you hear my end of the story here, Ben.
6208	Ben	All right. Fine.Oh, man. I love you but you you're a complete wuss.
6209	Dr. Cox	I guess I got a little scared.
6210	Ben	Well, let me know if there's anything I can do to help you through this rough patch.
6211	Dr. Cox	Oh, give me a break. I'm not good at this stuff, you know that.
6212	Ben	It's okay.
6213	Dr. Cox	I don't like the big conversations.
6214	Ben	It's cool. I've been thinking about death a lot lately.
6215	Dr. Cox	Oh, you gotta be kidding me...
6216	Ben	You think it's like New York? You know?
6217	J.D. Narration	To most people, it might have seemed like nothing had changed.
6218	Dr. Kelso	Well, Dr. Murphy?
6219	Doug	Umm...
6220	J.D. Narration	But it had a little.
6221	Dr. Kelso	Go on.
6222	Doug	Could it be lupus?
6223	Dr. Kelso	Good job, sport.
6224	Doug	Phew.
6225	Turk	"Joy... and pain!" Here we go, here we go! "And sunshine..." What else? What else? "And rain!" Cut him up! Cut him up!
6226	J.D. Narration	As for Ben, he actually responded to the chemo and went into remission. Hopefully, he won't be back, but who knows? Still, that's not what this story's about.It's about the day I realized that admitting we're not heroic is when we're the most heroic of all.
6227	All	Now unleash the dog of wonder / Tearing evil, spans asunder! / Underdog / Ahhhh, Underdog! / Underdog...
6228	J.D. Narration	I guess he'll always be a hero to me.
6229	Janitor	"He'll always be a hero to me." What a girl. What else we got?Theater camp. Ha ha. Bingo.
6230	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
6231	J.D.'s Narration	Since I was a kid, I've been able to sleep through anything - storms, sirens, you name it. Last night I didn't sleep. Couldn't stop thinking about this past year.
6232	J.D.	Agh!
6233	Elliot	Oh, please, I've seen you naked before.
6234	Todd	Dude, you had that? Five, up high, for cherry pie!
6235	Dr. Kelso	You find it funny, Dr. Dorian? Why don't you tell me the EKG findings of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome?
6236	J.D.	I haven't even showered yet.
6237	Jordan	We could shower together for old time's sake.
6238	J.D.	You know, I never woulda slept with you if you'd told me you were Dr. Cox's ex-wife.
6239	Dr. Cox	What was that, Newbie?
6240	J.D.	Uhhh....
6241	Jordan	Relax. He doesn't know.
6242	J.D.	He likes Carla, anyway.
6243	Turk	I got Carla wrapped around my finger.
6244	J.D.	I heard that!
6245	Carla	What are you guys talking about?
6246	J.D.	Nothing.
6247	Turk	Thank you.
6248	J.D.	Forget about it.
6249	Jordan	No, no, no. You can't forget about these.
6250	Nurse Roberts	I'd pull those hands back if you want to keep 'em, Q-Tip.
6251	Lawyer	That's just the kind of thing that can be construed as sexual harassment.You got a few hairs in the sink, there, huh? For God's sake, man, don't comb so hard.
6252	J.D.	All right, enough is enough!Oh!
6253	Janitor	I guess I don't fit in with your mirror friends. Enjoy.
6254	J.D.'s Narration	I don't know why my mind is all over the place. Maybe it's because today isn't just any other day; it's my last day as an intern.
6255	Elliot	Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh!
6256	Turk	Ohhh, you got me! Lemme go, lemme go, lemme go, lemme go!
6257	J.D.	Ahhh!
6258	Turk	Hey, amigo!
6259	Elliot	Can you guys believe this?
6260	Turk	'Cause tomorrow we are officially residents!
6261	Todd	Let's get our last day on!
6262	J.D.'s Thoughts	What the hell, he deserves it, too.
6263	J.D.	Mo
6264	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
6265	J.D.	So, Mr. Bober, here, has been complaining of abdominal pain and nausea; looks like colicistitis.
6266	Dr. Cox	Oh, come on what the hell, Newbie. This gentleman is suffering from an inflamed gallbladder, and you actually have him eating a grilled-cheese sandwich. Hhhere's an idea: why don't we just have him wash the whole thing down with a big ol' mug of vodka.Mr. Bober, back there, is one of our frequent flyers; he's been with us every six months for the last two years, and I've grown rather fond of him. So if you could somehow manage to not kill him, well then - oh, gee that would just be ducky.
6267	J.D.	I'll see what I can do. Hey, how come you haven't mentioned it's my last day as an intern?
6268	Dr. Cox	Haven't I?
6269	J.D.	Nuh-uh.
6270	Dr. Cox	Come here!
6271	J.D.	Okay.
6272	Dr. Cox	Despite the fact that when you wake up tomorrow morning you will be a resident, you'll still be the same excitable little girl that you are right now; the only difference will be that some sorry new intern will probably mistake you for somebody who actually knows something.
6273	J.D.'s Thoughts	Why is he so uptight today?
6274	Jordan	Hey, Perry.
6275	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, okay.
6276	Dr. Cox	Jordan.... To what do we owe the horror?
6277	Jordan	Ohhh, come on, Perry. No soft spot for the one woman who slept with you sober? Now, if you could just sign this insurance physical, I'll go back to trying to forget that horrible, horrible night.
6278	Dr. Cox	For me to sign this, I would actually have to give you a physical. And when I say "I," I, of course, mean absolutely anybody but me. Barbie!Give my ex-wife, here, a physical. And don't be afraid of that third eye on her chest. Just remember, it's just as scared of you as you are of it.
6279	Elliot	Let's get physical?
6280	Jordan	Auh.
6281	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
6282	Carla	It doesn't matter, because it
6283	Turk	And I don't think
6284	J.D.	Carla.... Can you do me a favor? This Mr. Bober needs to get another Foley catheter - I am so swamped.
6285	Carla	Sure, Bambi, no problem. But, we're not finished yet!
6286	Turk	I know we're not finished yet! See, I didn't say we were finished yet.... But, really, baby, it's up to you.
6287	J.D.'s Narration	When a couple gets in an argument, you should run for it before you get roped in.
6288	Carla	Hey, J.D.You got it, baby. You got him, that's right.
6289	Turk	I got him.
6290	Carla	Bring him in.
6291	Turk	I. Got. Him.
6292	Carla	We were talking about our relationship, and how great everything is going. And all I said was, "It's weird to think I'll never date again."
6293	Turk	Ah, that's close, honey, but not quite what you said. See, what you said was, "It's weird to think I'll never _get_ to date again." You see that? "..._Get_ to date again" - like she's missing out. How messed up is that?
6294	Carla	I did not say "get"! You're being ridiculous. What do you think, J.D.?
6295	J.D.'s Thoughts	Careful, tiger. Careful.
6296	J.D.	I wish people would call me "tiger."
6297	Carla	What?
6298	J.D.	I agree with Laverne!
6299	Nurse Roberts	Huh?Damn kids and their stupid problems. I just want to get home to a warm bath, catch a little bit of that 'Fear Factor.'

6301	Dr. Kelso	Ted, the reason we're not admiring the new parking structure is because you failed to get legal clearance from the Zoning Board. Honestly, sometimes I wonder if you're happy here.
6302	Ted	Do it, Ted; just do it.
6303	Dr. Cox	Oh, Bob! When I heard you were up on the roof, I just naturally assumed it was because your evil mission here on planet earth had finally come to an end; so, tell me this: where, exactly, is the mother ship?
6304	Dr. Kelso	Look, Ted, it's Dr. Cox.
6305	Ted	Hey.
6306	Dr. Cox	I just saw the new shift schedule and, dammit, Bob, gimme a break, will ya?
6307	Dr. Kelso	Oh, I'm glad you're here. The hospital needs to find a new residency director, and I've decided to recommend you. Now, finish your tantrum on your own; because I am going to go down to the cafeteria and get myself a fro-yo. Ted, chop-chop!
6308	Ted	Save my spot.

6310	Carla	Bambi, Mr. Bober's hypertensive. I think he's becoming septic.
6311	J.D.	This guy is more work than all my other patients, combined.
6312	Carla	Well, maybe if you tell him how hard it is on you, he'll get better!I'll get paper towel.
6313	J.D.	Don't worry about it; somebody else'll get it.
6314	Janitor	Yeah. Who can we get? I'm not shocked, that's how you live your life, isn't it? Got a problem? Hey, just pass it on down the line....
6315	J.D.'s Thoughts	I was gonna say something, but, it turns out, he gave me a pretty good idea.
6316	J.D.	Thank you so much for taking Bober from me.
6317	Elliot	But, J.D., I just
6318	J.D.	I owe you.
6319	Jordan	I'm a little doormat, sit and stay. Let people use me every single day.
6320	Elliot	E-e-excuse me?
6321	Jordan	Oh, it's a song I'm working on. I made it up.
6322	Elliot	So, I let myself get taken advantage of, sometimes; you know. I mean, big deal - how do you make friends?
6323	Jordan	Look, I've seen your type before. You're that girl that convinced herself she wanted to lose her virginity at a frat party while another guy was asleep in the room.
6324	Elliot	Chas really cared for me.
6325	Jordan	Ah, I know; and I'm sure you have a cool "Jungle Party" t-shirt to prove it. Now, can we please finish this physical? And, I can't pee right now, so you'll have to go for me.What a good girl. Good girl.
6326	J.D.'s Narration	Still, Elliot wasn't gonna let herself get stuck with Mr. Bober, either.
6327	Turk	How you doin', Mr... Bober?
6328	Mr. Bober	Fine.
6329	Turk	'Kay, why did you let Elliot turf him up here?
6330	Todd	I dunno. All I really remember is she dropped her pen, and bent over.... Dude! Thong City!!
6331	Turk	No; no high-five for you.
6332	Todd	Todd did bad?
6333	Turk	Todd did very bad. Todd did very, very bad.What the hell, Elliot? You can't just pawn this Bober guy off on me!
6334	Elliot	Hey, it was J.D.'s patient! I was just the middleman.... -Woman.... -Person.
6335	J.D.	Look, we can stand here and argue all day about who screwed who
6336	Elliot	Or?
6337	J.D.	Or nothing, I'm on break - let's do it.
6338	Turk	Okay, Rock-Paper-Scissors, right now.
6339	J.D.	Fine, loser gets Bober.
6340	Elliot	Once, twice, three: shoot!
6341	Granddaughter	Did you say "Bober"? I'm looking for my grandfather, Frank Bober.
6342	Nurse Roberts	We moved him to the ICU, dear. Uh, he'll show you up.
6343	Elliot	It's okay. She-she didn't hear us.
6344	Nurse Roberts	No. But Jesus did. Just a closer walk with thee....

6346	Dr. Cox	I didn't appreciate your little game this morning, there, Bobbo
6347	Dr. Kelso	Heavens to Betsy, the gaspacho is scrumptious today.
6348	Dr. Cox	...Danglin' that fake promotion right out in front of me.
6349	Dr. Kelso	I was dead-serious about the residency director's position.
6350	Dr. Cox	Well, what makes you think that I'd be interested in something like that?
6351	Dr. Kelso	Because you want my job, and you know that you'll never get it without this on your resume.
6352	Dr. Cox	But you hate me!
6353	Dr. Kelso	Like nuts in brownies, captain.
6354	Dr. Cox	Well, then, I don't get your angle. What could you possibly want from me in exchange for my support? Because I'm telling you right now, I am not dating that daughter of yours.
6355	Dr. Kelso	I only have a son.
6356	Dr. Cox	That's my bad - I was just going by that picture on your desk.
6357	Dr. Kelso	I'll tell you what I want: You know the financial burdens I have to deal with around here. I want you to stop busting my chops all the time and get on my team.
6358	Dr. Cox	Forget about it.
6359	Dr. Kelso	Fine. Walk away. Mmm. Scrumptious. Wan' bite?
6360	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
6361	Turk	We're doctors, you know? And that's just how doctors talk to other doctors.
6362	Elliot	Yeah. I mean, we were just joking around. I mean, our only mistake was not being careful about where we were.
6363	J.D.	That's right. We all agree we did nothing wrong; so let's just check in on him and forget about it.
6364	J.D.'s Narration	And that's when the three of us realized, even though we'd all spent time with Mr. Bober, none of us had any idea what he looked like.
6365	Carla	Over here.
6366	Mr. Bober	Hey, guys!
6367	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
6368	J.D.'s Narration	When we started here a year ago, and saw some of the insensitive and jaded doctors, we all said the same thing: "That's not gonna be me." But really, the only solace is that the guilt passes pretty quickly.
6369	Mr. Bober	What's wrong, dawg?
6370	J.D.	You guys, we have to do something. If we remove Mr. Bober's gallbladder, it should relieve the recurrent abdominal pain.
6371	Carla	Isn't he a little old for that kind of procedure?
6372	Elliot	Well, he seems stable enough.
6373	Turk	Problem is, he has no insurance.
6374	J.D.'s Narration	And then, all at once, we realized we had to do something. We decided to attack the problem on three fronts.
6375	J.D.	Dr. Cox.
6376	Elliot	Ms. Sullivan?
6377	Turk	Dr. Wen.
6378	J.D.	So I thought if you looked at Mr. Bober's chart, and and you agreed with us, you might be able to, you know, pull some strings, er....
6379	J.D.'s Thoughts	And now, here it comes - the calling me a girl's name, the telling me not to waste my time....
6380	Dr. Cox	Yeah. I'll be more than glad to help you, there, Charlotte.
6381	J.D.'s Thoughts	I was half right.
6382	J.D.	W-well, th thank you!
6383	Dr. Cox	Don't ever be afraid to come to me with stuff like that. The simple fact that you actually seem to give a crap is the reason I took an interest in you to begin with. It's why I trust you as a doctor. Hell, it's...it's why I trust you as a person.
6384	J.D.	Are you dying?
6385	Dr. Cox	I've got a new shrink.
6386	J.D.'s Thoughts	Aw, just say it.
6387	J.D.	You know, Dr. Cox, I wanna thank you for this whole year
6388	Dr. Cox	Oh, no, no, no...no.
6389	J.D.	And I just wanna know...if I can buy you dinner.
6390	Dr. Cox	That'd be terrific.
6391	J.D.	Great! I'm off in, like, a half hour
6392	Dr. Cox	Oh, no. Here, I was led to believe that you were doing a gift certificate kind of thing. But, to sit and eat...with you, that's-that's just...that's crazy talk! I have half a mind to issue you a drug test. I mean, come on, what'd I sign up for
6393	J.D.	Would have been nice.
6394	Elliot	Well, he doesn't have insurance, so if you could talk to the other members of the board today at the meeting, well, J.D. thought maybe we could
6395	Jordan	"J.D. thought"? First he dumps that patient on you, and now he wants you to ask me a favor? Honey, if you don't start saying no to him soon, you're gonna wind up on the losing end of a little game I like to call Hide The Pickle.
6396	Elliot	Oh! J.D. and I are just colleagues.
6397	Jordan	Oh, my God; I was just joking, but you actually slept with him, didn't you?
6398	Elliot	Pff. ...A...little.
6399	Jordan	Look, I don't know where your mother was when she should have been telling you all these things, but you cannot have sex with someone you care about! Sex is for making babies and revenge.
6400	Elliot	Well, you're so full of it.
6401	Jordan	Listen, Stick, if you wanna wipe your nose and pretend that was a sneeze, I will play along. But if you have something to say, say it.
6402	Elliot	Everybody knows you're still sleeping with Dr. Cox; and it can't be about making babies 'cause you'd probably just end up eating them, anyway. And as for revenge, I'm just not sure that driving to his apartment and pleasuring him while he watches sports on TV is hurting him as much as you might think. So I have to figure that you still care about him, whether you want to admit it or not. And if you lay one finger on me, I'm blowing my rape whistle.
6403	Todd	Kiss her.
6404	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
6405	Turk	So you see, Dr. Wen, it's not really a favor - you were supposed to do surgery on Mrs. Beckerman, but she passed away this morning.
6406	Dr. Wen	Go on.
6407	Turk	Yeah, she's dead, and we were hoping that maybe you could keep her name on the roster? And, it's not-we don't wanna do surgery on her. Let's face it, Dr. Wen, we're good - but we're not that good, you know what I'm saying?
6408	Dr. Wen	No.
6409	Carla	Dr. Wen, we're trying to get a patient approved for surgery; we're hoping you can keep the slot open.
6410	Dr. Wen	Oh, sure. Dr. Turk, next time you need to talk to me, think hard about what you want to say, then send her.
6411	Turk	Of course. Thanks Dr. Wen!
6412	Carla	See, what happened there was, I knew what you were trying to say despite the exact words you were using; so I tried to help you out, instead of getting all mad at you over nothing.
6413	Turk	Right, baby, we both know it's not the same.
6414	Carla	You are the dumbest man I ever laid eyes on.Still.
6415	Todd	Didn't hurt! Didn't hurt!
6416	Turk	Uh-huh? Tell me if it hurts this time!
6417	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
6418	Dr. Kelso	So, you want me to approve surgery on a 76-year-old man with no insurance and no life-threatening condition. Young man, I'm curious: what did you think the end result of this conversation would be?
6419	J.D.	Well, pretty much this, except I'm really invested and so I thought I might try crying a little.
6420	Dr. Kelso	Sport, if crying worked on me, my wife would have her own car by now.
6421	Dr. Cox	Uh...Bob? I think you should reconsider.
6422	Dr. Kelso	Uh, what's that, Perry? I mean, because that didn't sound like something a team-mate would say. Maybe what you meant to do was pat me on the ass and say, "Go get 'em, Bob."
6423	Dr. Cox	Right but, what if...we were to look at this from a purely...fiscal perspective.
6424	J.D.'s Thoughts	Did he just say "fiscal"?
6425	Dr. Cox	I mean, after all, Mr. Bober is here every four to six months, and if we were to consider his surgery as a one-time expenditure, then...you would be making the right financial call.
6426	Dr. Kelso	See, now, that's the kind of thinking I can get behind! How's that make you feel?
6427	Dr. Cox	Dirty all over.
6428	Dr. Kelso	You get used to it. Boys, I'll do what I can, but if you're gonna pull this off, you're gonna need a board member behind you.
6429	J.D.'s Thoughts	How the hell we supposed to get that?
6430	Dr. Cox	This is the closest I've come to not hating myself after sleeping with you
6431	Jordan	Oh, you're just saying that.
6432	Dr. Cox	Actually, I'm not. I-we connected. What's wrong with you?
6433	Jordan	Nothing! I guess I was just thinking of a guy I kind of like.
6434	Dr. Cox	Lemme guess...lemme guess: He is an arrogant, self-hating narcissist who just needs to be loved.
6435	Jordan	Yeah, pretty much.
6436	Dr. Cox	Nobody better.
6437	Jordan	Hey, stud, thank you for not asking me to help out on the Mr. Bober thing.
6438	Dr. Cox	I would've but, it would have been pointless. It turns out, you're a very predictable woman, there, Jordan.
6439	Jordan	Puh-lease!
6440	Dr. Cox	I know you. You're gonna walk into that board room tonight, all tall and strong, and then you're gonna sit back and just pray that nobody asks your opinion. I mean, I'm sure you-you probably think that your little visits here are a spontaneous surprise, but, did you ever wonder why the only two candles that I own are already lit when you walk in that door? I mean, doll, I hate to tell you this but, I don't walk around all day with cologne down in my engine room. I'm not that guy!
6441	Jordan	Some people like reliability.
6442	Dr. Cox	In a sedan, it turns out it's terrific. Cheers.Here's the good news, however: It turns out, it's never too late to turn the whole thing around.
6443	Jordan	Really....
6444	Dr. Cox	All you gotta do is stir it up a little bit.
6445	Jordan	Stir it up?
6446	Dr. Cox	Stir it right the hell up.
6447	Jordan	I'll try to remember that.
6448	Dr. Cox	So I'm guessing, I'll be seeing you in about eleven days, right?Probably at the exact same time. Don't forget to stir it up, baby.

6450	J.D.'s Narration	And so it comes down to this: The hospital board meeting to decide Mr. Bober's fate - and in a weird way, ours, too.As cheesy as it sounds, I think we knew we were all gonna be okay. Still, I've had this feeling that I'm forgetting something.
6451	Janitor	Hey, congratulations on becoming a resident. Glad I could help.
6452	J.D.	Help!?! You were awful to me! You-you-you-you-Awful!
6453	Janitor	Anyway: Go get 'em, Tiger. The world is your oyster, my friend.What?

6455	Janitor	This door is broke, maybe the fifth time or so it don't open.
6456	Intern	Maybe there's a paper clip stuck in there?
6457	Janitor	Why a paper clip?
6458	Intern	I was just makin' small talk.
6459	Janitor	Did you put a paper clip in there?

6467	J.D.	Oh, Ms. Sullivan, thank you for helping us with Mr. Bober.
6468	Jordan	Oh, don't mention it! And even though I wasn't invited to your little party, I brought presents for everyone!
6469	Dr. Cox	Brace yourself, there, newbie.
6470	Jordan	Carla, my ex-husband is in love with you. It's true. Ask your boyfriend, he knows; he and Perry talk about it all the time. I don't know why you haven't mentioned this to her! Perhaps you're afraid of something? Huh. And Bob? When are you gonna tell Perry that that promotion you're making him jump through hoops for? was filled months ago! It just seems wrong. Which brings us to Twinkie. If you don't have the courage to tell your 'colleague' Dr. Dorian that you're still crazy about him, I'm gonna go ahead and do it for ya, 'cause that's what friends do. Yeah! And finally, Perry, you are not gonna believe what happened the first time I met your little protégé, here....

6485	J.D.	How could you let a woman kick you out of your own bed?
6486	Turk	Baby, why you have to be so cranky in the morning?
6487	J.D.	This is unacceptable. You said we were gonna sleep head-to-foot.
6488	Turk	Dude, either way the naughty bits are still in the middle.
6489	J.D.	Yeah, but with the head-to-foot alignment, it's just there's no way for them to lock in.

6530	J.D.'s Narration	Life in a hospital is made up of highs and lows. For instance, my spare pair of scrubs doesn't match, but I put my underwear in the microwave to dry them off, and they feel gooooooooooood.
6531	Nurse Roberts	What are you smiling at?
6532	J.D.	Could I have Mr. Buckley's chart, please?
6533	Nurse Roberts	No problem. I keep it right down there, in the 'Get it yourself' file.
6534	Dr. Cox	You know, Bob, I've been thinking about all the times that you've manipulated me and toyed with me, and, well, I can't help but recall that children's fable about the race between the tortoise and the pain-in-the-ass chief of medicine that everybody hates.You see, Bob, the pain-in-the-ass chief of medicine that everybody hates kept running out in front of the tortoise and taunting him; but right at the end gosh, I'm sure you remember what happened, Bob the tortoise bit clean-through the chief of medicine's calf muscle, dragged him to the ground, where he and all the other turtles devoured him alive, right there on the racetrack. It's a... disturbing children's book, Bob, I know, but it's one that stuck with me, nonetheless.
6535	Dr. Kelso	Buzzy, buzz, buzz....
6536	Dr. Cox	I...beg your pardon?
6537	Dr. Kelso	Oh, uh, that's the sound of all the bees in your bonnet. And, Perry, even though I could give a rat's ass, I still think it's a pretty sound!

6541	J.D.'s Thoughts	What the hell?
6542	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Dorian.
6543	J.D.	Woo!
6544	Dr. Kelso	Here you go, whiz-kid.
6545	J.D.	Ooh! Is that my new nickname? 'Cause, you know, I actually thought people were gonna start calling me that in high school when I was in our production of 'The Wiz'....Yeah, it was the sort of the "hip" version of 'The Wizard of Oz'.... Nipsey Russell played the TinMan? "Come on and ease on down, ease on down the road!" Remember that? No? Well, anyway, you know, kids can be mean and everyone just started calling me "Dorothy." ...High school was hard....
6546	Dr. Kelso	Oh, I'm sorry, sport; I was thinking about soup. Now, Mr. Zerbo was initially admitted with a high fever and suspected meningitis; but, both the NCT and the lumbar puncture came back negative.
6547	J.D.	Uh...yeah, sir, I have a full patient load; I don't understand that you just drop this guy in my lap and expect me to make him a top priority.
6548	Dr. Kelso	You want me to say "ta da!" so it seems more like a trick? Mr. Zerbo back there is a major hospital benefactor. And, by golly, you know it's a lot harder to write a big, fat check if you're dead.
6549	J.D.	Neurology, rheumatology, hematology.... This guy's been turfed to every service in the hospital, no one knows what's wrong with him, what do you want me to do?
6550	Dr. Kelso	I hope it's navy bean today.
6551	J.D.	Dr. Kelso....
6552	Dr. Kelso	Well, gee, sport! I would say you should stop whining, find out what's wrong with him, and treat it; or you can be damn sure I'm going to give you something to whine about.

6562	Carla	For him? Not your fault.
6563	Turk	No, I'm talking about us. I'm sorry for what I did wrong.
6564	Carla	Which was?
6565	Turk	....You know....?
6566	Carla	See! You don't even realize why I'm upset. That'sWhy are you smiling?
6567	Turk	Because I set yo' ass up!Baby, I shoulda told you how Cox felt about you, and I was wrong for talking behind your back, which is a violation of the trust our relationship is based on. And that is why I'm sorry.
6568	Todd	My boy's got mad apologizin' skills!
6569	Turk	Todd, not now!
6570	Carla	You can't just point out the obvious you have to go deeper.And Todd, if you say, "That's what she said," I will brain you.Now, come on, Baby; connect with me why am I really upset?
6571	Turk	I'm gonna stick with the violation of trust thing final answer.Heh!
6572	Carla	Yeah, right...
6573	Todd	Ohhhhhhhhhhh....You know, I got half a mind to ask her out.Too soon?

6575	J.D.	Well, thanks for the loaners, Chet.
6576	Chet	Don't stain 'em.
6577	J.D.'s Narration	Once you're a resident here, you get a decent locker. Still, it's a co-ed room, so if you need to change.......you do it fast.
6578	J.D.	Dude! That was, like, some sort of record, or something!
6579	Telephone	Hello!? Hello!?!
6580	Elliot	Sorry, mom. It's just it's gotten really awkward with this guy that I was seeing and Yes, mom, 'Yay, I'm straight.' Look, I just, I don't know what to do; I mean, every time I see hm, I get so embarrassed, and...lonely, and...mortified.... And I guess I was just hoping that you could Um.... About a hundred-and-fifteen pounds? Phen-fen kills people, mom! B-because I'm a a doctor, that's...how I know.
6581	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
6582	Dr. Cox	You look pretty today.
6583	Carla	Don't even start with me.
6584	Dr. Cox	You look horrible?
6585	Carla	I look fantastic! And what you're doing, that's starting. I'm pretty sure I said not to start. Laverne?
6586	Nurse Roberts	That's what she said.
6587	Dr. Cox	It's "don't start" in Spanish.
6588	Nurse Roberts	Bueno.
6589	J.D.'s Narration	I had planned to avoid Dr. Cox all day; but, unfortunately, I needed his help.
6590	J.D.	Dr. Cox, I have this, uh, patient, Mr. Zerbo, I can't quite
6591	J.D.'s Thoughts	Who knows.... Maybe he just decided to let the whole ex-wife thing go.
6592	Dr. Cox	Auto-immune serologies?
6593	J.D.	All negative.
6594	J.D.'s Thoughts	Then again, maybe he's just letting me stew for a while.
6595	Dr. Cox	Bone-marrow biopsy?
6596	J.D.	Negative.
6597	J.D.'s Thoughts	What kind of man tortures people like this!?!
6598	Dr. Cox	Afraid you got yourself a toughie.
6599	J.D.	Okay, fine: I'm sorry I slept with your ex-wife!
6600	Nurse Roberts	I think I'll sit back down.
6601	J.D.	It was an accident.
6602	Dr. Cox	Look.... First of all, it's not like you tripped and fell into her...and then out of her...and then into her...again. And, second of all, you're smart enough to know that I don't want to talk about this; I don't want to know where you did it; I don't even want to know...how it was.
6603	J.D.	A little scary Sorry! Jitters!
6604	J.D.'s Thoughts	And here come the fireworks....
6605	Dr. Cox	Lookit: I know you didn't have any idea who she was, and I understand why you were too nervous to tell me. So, whatta ya say we leave it at that? I forgive you; you are forgiven. Okay?
6606	J.D.'s Thoughts	Cool!
6607	Nurse Roberts	Damn.
6608	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
6609	J.D.'s Narration	Hospitals aren't as big as you think. Eventually, you run into everyone.
6610	J.D.	Hey, Elliot.
6611	Elliot	I'm not I'm not hiding! Um...I just I w I was just looking for my, um...you know the....I was...looking for my dignity.
6612	J.D.	Did you find it?
6613	Elliot	No.I must have left it at college.
6614	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, for God's sakes, would you throw her a rope?
6615	J.D.	I have no idea how to treat this patient. Help me out.
6616	J.D.'s Thoughts	Now, she's in a really awkward place; so just be sensitive.
6617	J.D.	I think we should sex each other.
6618	Elliot	I'm sorry?
6619	J.D.	Just hear me out: Our relationship ended so quickly, maybe too quickly, you know? And, now there's like these these feelings floating around, and I feel like we're always gonna regret it if we don't...see if they lead somewhere.What do you think?I can't believe how weird it feels to be back here again.
6620	Turk	Yeah.... But it seems so right.
6621	J.D.	If Carla's so mad, I don't understand why she doesn't just crash at her own place.
6622	Turk	Oh, she is back at her place.
6623	J.D.	What are you talking about, Willis?
6624	Turk	That's pretty funny!We should make that one of our things.
6625	J.D.	Yeah, I know.
6626	Carla	That's stupid.
6627	Turk	I think I'd really panic if she went back to her place.J.D., this sucks.
6628	J.D.	Yeah. You know what's weird, though? It's like, Dr. Cox and I are pretty vegan-kosher.
6629	Turk	He hasn't yelled at you?
6630	J.D.	No.
6631	Turk	This is the guy that screamed on you for like twenty minutes for dropping a thermometer? And he hasn't raised his voice once about you bumping uglies with his ex-wife?
6632	J.D.	Mm-mm.
6633	Turk	I don't get that guy.
6634	J.D.'s Narration	And that's when I realized something....
6635	Dr. Cox	Hey, where you been? I paged you twice.
6636	J.D.	Uh...I must have misplaced my pager.
6637	J.D.'s Narration	The reason Dr. Cox wasn't yelling at me like he used to...
6638	Dr. Cox	Huh. Probably ought to try and find that.
6639	J.D.'s Narration	...he didn't care about me anymore.
6640	Janitor	Yep, that's a leaky o-ring. I can fix her...but...I don't got the parts in stock. We need an o-ring down here!That's entertainment! Whoa.
6641	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
6642	J.D.'s Narration	Standing there, I couldn't help thinking about the way things used to be....

6648	J.D.'s Narration	And it wasn't just me and Dr. Cox who weren't getting along....Everyone was just drifting through the halls.Each one of us acting like the others didn't exist.That's when I decided to get proactive. And I knew just where to start.

6650	J.D.'s Thoughts	What the bejeezus?
6651	Todd	Hello, boys.
6652	J.D.	What the hell are you doing?
6653	Todd	This is how The Todd gets his self-esteem on.
6654	J.D.	Do these help?
6655	Todd	Uncool!You look totally hot, Mirror Todd.
6656	J.D.	Hey.
6657	Elliot	Hey.
6658	J.D.	You know, Elliot, I think we should talk about the sexual tension
6659	Elliot	There is no sexual tension, okay!Just...go ahead and look before your neck snaps.
6660	J.D.	Awesome!
6661	Elliot	J.D., the problem is this place. I mean, when we broke up, I had to see you the next day...and the next day. And we never...got any distance from the relationship. I never got...to move on, you know?
6662	J.D.	And the and the sexual tension.
6663	Elliot	Oh, my God! You have no idea what you sound like, do you?

6669	J.D.	Is it starting to burn?!
6670	Janitor	I would think so.Hey, uh, don't touch your eyes!
6671	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
6672	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay: Right back on the horse.
6673	J.D.	First off, I'd like to thank you all for agreeing to talk.
6674	Carla	Bambi, you paged us here.
6675	J.D.	Be that as it may, I think there are some simple solutions. Dr. Cox, you're angry with me.
6676	Dr. Cox	No, I'm not.
6677	J.D.	And you won't admit this, but you're in love with Carla.
6678	Carla	No, he's not.
6679	Dr. Cox	Actually, I am.
6680	Carla	You're starting again.
6681	J.D.	And Carla, you're mad that Turk didn't trust you enough to tell you.
6682	Turk	See? Trust, woman, trust!
6683	J.D.	Whatever. The point is that Turk is sorry.
6684	Turk	Not anymore!
6685	Carla	I can't believe you thought he was a threat.
6686	Dr. Cox	I'm a threat!
6687	Carla	You're not in love with me, you idealize me.
6688	J.D.	Can we just try and stay focused
6689	Turk	You're mad 'cause I'm scared of losing you?
6690	Carla	Yes, because we're stronger than that!
6691	Dr. Cox	Apparently not!
6692	Turk	You should be glad I never took our relationship for granted, you silly woman!
6693	J.D.	If we could just refrain from name calling
6694	Dr. Cox	Oprah's right!
6695	Turk	Lay off of him.
6696	Carla	You're just pissed because you're still in love with your ex.
6697	Dr. Cox	Okay, that's it! Now, I have killed for so much less than that, and I'll damn-sure do it again unless you all shut the hell up right now and I MEAN NOW!
6698	J.D.	Aren't you glad we did this?
6699	Turk	I'm going out for Mexican food tonight. And I'll see you in bed, my friend.
6700	J.D.	Oh, my God rounds!
6701	Cut to	The Hall
6702	J.D.'s Thoughts	Rounds started five minutes ago, and I totally forgot about Mr. Zerbo! Oh, my God...Oh, my God...Oh, my God
6703	Nurse Roberts	Are you plannin' on makin' this worth my while?
6704	J.D.	Ow!
6705	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Dorian? How 'bout you step up to the mic and tell the entire gang how you ended up treating Mr. Zerbo.
6706	J.D.'s Thoughts	Think, Whiz Kid, think!Ah, the hell with it.
6707	J.D.	Sir, I did nothing.
6708	Old Guy	Is this because of the same kid as before?
6709	Dude	Shh!
6710	Dr. Kelso	You did...nothing?
6711	J.D.	Nothing at all.
6712	Dr. Kelso	Great job, sport!
6713	J.D.'s Thoughts	Huh?
6714	Dr. Kelso	Whenever a patient gets bounced from ward to ward, there's always a chance a high fever could be sustained or even caused by a constant stream of different antibiotics. It's call drug fever. And it's a good catch by Dr. Dorian.Next patient! Mush, people.Mush! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!!!!
6715	Mr. Zerbo	Thank you, doctor.
6716	J.D.	Oh, no problem.
6717	J.D.'s Narration	It's funny.... I guess sometimes when you do nothing at all, things just have a way of fixing themselves.
6718	Cut to	The Hall
6719	Dr. Cox	Hey.
6720	Cut to	The CafeteriaJ.D.'s Room EveningOutside The Hospital The Wheelchair Ramp Day
6721	Troubadour	...Day after day it reappears / Night after night my heartbeat shows the fear....Ghosts appear and fade away / Come back another day
6722	Dr. Cox	That'll do it.
6723	Troubadour	I have other songs.
6724	Dr. Cox	Yeah, ya do.Do you know how I know that this is yours, Farrah? 'Cause when I paged you earlier, someone found it next to a can of Fresca and a dog-eared copy of Teen People magazine. Anyway long story, short: The whole incident gave me a bang-up idea; because, you see, I've got tomorrow off. So I'm gonna be on my couch, sipping on some scotch and paging you every twenty seconds. And if you don't answer every damn last one of 'em, I'm gonna shove this thing so far down your throat it's gonna make you take a tinkle every time it goes off. Big fun, right?You're gonna need this.Oh!Oh!Let it come. Let it Oh! Let it come!
6725	J.D.'s Thoughts	Ahhh. It's good to be home.......Sort of.
6726	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
6727	Janitor	Argh.
6728	J.D.	There. Just a tiny splinter! It's funny; I can't stop thinking about Aesop's Fables you know, the one where the the lion's always hassling the little mouse...but then the mouse pulls a thorn from his paw.
6729	Janitor	Oh, right.... But then the lion kills him anyway. Yeah.
6730	J.D.	No he doesn't.
6731	Janitor	Trust me.
6732	Dr. Cox	Sandy, whatta ya say we start our work day.
6733	J.D.	You know, "Sandy" isn't necessarily a girls' name.
6734	Dr. Cox	It's short for "Sandra".
6735	J.D.	Clear.
6736	Jordan	Hello, Perry.
6737	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, God. The ex-wife.
6738	Dr. Cox	Jordan. What a coincidence! You were in my dream last night. I can't say for certain, but I was having the flesh torn from my bones by a cross-eyed water snake you, right?
6739	Jordan	Yes.
6740	Dr. Cox	Right?
6741	Jordan	Yeah.
6742	Dr. Cox	Right?
6743	Jordan	Mm-hmm. Say, let's play a game: I'll throw out an adjective describing how one of you is in bed, and you guys try to guess who it is!
6744	J.D.	Remember, I had no idea she was your ex at the time.
6745	Dr. Cox	Heh?
6746	Jordan	Okay. Clumsy!
6747	Dr. Cox	Don't answer that, Newbie.
6748	J.D.	No worries.
6749	Dr. Cox	Goodbye, Jordan. Sandy.
6750	J.D.	Ow!
6751	Jordan	Good job, D.J.
6752	J.D.	You know, it's J.D. Okay? And at least I remember the names of all my sexual partners.
6753	Jordan	Well, I'm sure that girl from high school and your bunk-mate from Camp Morning Wood are both extremely grateful. Yeah.
6754	J.D.	It was Camp Meadow Wood. ...I made a lanyard.
6755	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
6756	J.D.'s Narration	It sounds insensitive, but hospitals can be kind of boring. So if a policeman gets into an accident with the bad guy he's chasing, well, it pumps ya up!
6757	J.D.	Okay, move it along, fellas, there's nothing to see here. I'll be over here.
6758	Carla	Officer Berson was admitted with shortness of breath and chest pain.
6759	Elliot	Hey, J.D., do you think anyone else gets this excited over a car accident?
6760	J.D.	Maybe Hank....
6761	J.D.'s Narration	We weren't the only ones psyched to be in the game.
6762	Turk	The doctor is in. Bad guy, this is why you don't run from the po-lice! Baby, are you ready to rock?
6763	Nurse	Great. Another cocky resident that wants to start surgery before the attending shows up.
6764	Turk	I'm sorry; I just figured that if we finished here quick enough, we might have enough time to pull the stick outta your ass. Whatta you say?
6765	Dr. Kelso	Perry.
6766	Dr. Cox	Beelzebob. Lackey!
6767	Lawyer	Hey, Dr. Cox.
6768	Dr. Kelso	I'm being honored tonight by the board of trustees, and they asked me to say a few words.
6769	Dr. Cox	Oh! Yawn.
6770	Dr. Kelso	Anyway, I would like you to be the one who introduces me.
6771	Dr. Cox	Wow. Seriously?
6772	Dr. Kelso	Yeah!
6773	Dr. Cox	Not interested.
6774	Dr. Kelso	I didn't ask if you were interested.
6775	Dr. Cox	Bob, I deeply dislike you. Honestly, it keeps me up at night.
6776	Dr. Kelso	Well, then, use that passion! Put that rage on the page!
6777	Dr. Cox	Here's an idea: Why not use Big Chief Flop-Sweat, here?
6778	Dr. Kelso	Ted's not an impressive man.
6779	Lawyer	Hey....! That Ah, he's right.
6780	Dr. Cox	Okay.
6781	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
6782	Elliot	Officer Berson, you have a slight arrhythmia, so Dr. Dorian and I are going to monitor you very closely.
6783	J.D.	But don't worry, we're on top of it, okay?
6784	J.D.'s Thoughts	There's nothing like that feeling of really taking charge of a situation.
6785	Dr. Cox	Mary. Rhoda. Chart, please.What'd I stutter? Gimme the chart. Atta girl. Ew. Man. I don't like his 0-2 set. Grab me a doughnut, will ya?
6786	Elliot	Oh, you mean like a um a blood-pressure thingie?
6787	Dr. Cox	I mean like a glazed thingie. And I like sprinkles on half of it; so if you can't find a half sprinkled, get me all sprinkles and just go ahead and pick half of 'em off.
6788	J.D.	You know that was...kind of demeaning.
6789	Dr. Cox	You know, you're right. Would you do me a favor and apologize to her while you get me some coffee. And please be quick, otherwise I'm just gonna have the manager send over a different waitress. Go. You're done now. Yeah.
6790	J.D.'s Narration	The frustrating thing was, down in the OR, Turk was probably running the show.
6791	Attending	Steady, Dr. Turk; only about two more hours.
6792	Turk	Could you scratch my nose, please.
6793	Nurse	No. I can scratch _my_ nose. Oh, that feels good.
6794	Turk	Yeah.
6795	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
6796	Dr. Kelso	Miss Sullivan, I just want to thank you and the rest of the board for giving me this award. The fact that your first choice passed away last weekend in no way makes it any less special.
6797	Jordan	Are you sure? 'Cause it seems like it does.
6798	Dr. Cox	Hey, Bob. As far as the whole intro thing goes, I've actually gone ahead and given it a lot of thought, but I'm afraid I'm gonna very politely have to tell you to blow it out your ass.
6799	Dr. Kelso	I think we both understand how this works. It's like when my dog Baxter goes winkle on the carpet: He always heads right straight away from the tool shed, but we both know that's where he's gonna spend the night.
6800	Jordan	Charming story.
6801	Dr. Cox	Yeah. The fact of the matter is, I kinda make it a rule never to get in bed with people that I have nothing but contempt for.Oh.
6802	Jordan	That feels gooood, J.D.
6803	Dr. Cox	You'll now pay for that.
6804	Jordan	God, I hope so.
6805	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
6806	Elliot	You guys, we're residents now. We're supposed to have more responsibility, you know?
6807	Turk	I scratched my nose with Bad Guy's toe.
6808	J.D.	I think we just have to accept the fact that we're the most under-appreciated people at this hospital.
6809	Carla	Oh, Bambi, I really feel for you.
6810	J.D.	Thank you!
6811	Turk	She doesn't.
6812	Carla	J.D., I spend most of my time here getting orders barked at me by people who take credit for my work and blame me for their mistakes. And all the while, I'm expected to hold the doctor's hand. You should try trading places with me for one day.
6813	J.D.	It's actually not that bad. And the lace feels soft against my package.
6814	J.D.'s Thoughts	Nah.
6815	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
6816	Dr. Cox	Well, I'm glad we finally had a chance to, uh, talk.
6817	Jordan	You and me, both. I mean, I haven't had anyone to _talk_ to lately.
6818	Dr. Cox	Whoa-kay.
6819	Jordan	But boy, you sure do talk fast.
6820	Dr. Cox	Bye-bye!
6821	Jordan	Next time we talk, maybe I could finish a sentence or two.
6822	Carla	You still like her.
6823	Dr. Cox	Why, because we had a conversation in an empty room?
6824	Carla	That room's not empty.
6825	Dr. Cox	Listen, girlfriend, I don't wanna hear your misguided romantic notions. You see, for me, sex is a sport like racquet-ball: You play hard for a half an hour, work up a sweat, and hope you don't get hit in the eye.
6826	Carla	Say what you want, I know you care about her. In fact, I bet that after you two are done playing racquet-ball or talking or whatever you crazy kids are calling it, you'd like nothing better than to just lie there and pass the time by watching her sleep.
6827	Dr. Cox	Carla, it's impossible to actually lie next to Jordan, seeing as she sleeps hanging upside-down from the ceiling, wrapped in a cocoon of her own wings.
6828	Carla	That's nice.
6829	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
6830	Janitor	Hey. I thought about what you said, and you're right I owe you...so, I got you a date tonight.
6831	J.D.	Who?
6832	Janitor	Tim.
6833	J.D.	I'm not gay.
6834	Janitor	Huh? Oh! Oh.... I get it. Neither is Tim.
6835	J.D.'s Narration	Unfortunately, I'm on-call tonight, and as weird as this place is during the day...it's even worse at night. See, that's when all the weirdos come out.Like the ER doctor who likes to work nights 'cause he says he's up anyway.
6836	ER Doc	Hey, bro.
6837	J.D.'s Narration	Or the nurse who everyone agrees is just a little bit off.Or, if there's a full moon....
6838	Lawyer	Hey. This is my band. We all work in different departments in the hospital.
6839	J.D.	Ted, I know, you told me last time that we

6841	Randall	Accounting
6842	Crispin	Shipping and Receiving
6843	Roy	On-site property management including pest control, night-time security, non-arboreal gardening services, and tenant-related easements and liens.
6844	J.D.	Hey, you got promoted!
6845	The Band	And it's about time. He's/I've been busting his/my hump around here for six years. Mm-mmm.
6846	Lawyer	Dr. Kelso lets us practice here at night.
6847	J.D.	Oh, yeah, I remember, the uh cartoon theme songs.
6848	Lawyer	No, no, no. That was lame. We do prime-time now.
6849	J.D.	Hey. So, what attendings are stuck here on-call tonight?
6850	Turk	Everyone's at that Kelso thing.
6851	Elliot	I think Dr. Cox is on.
6852	Carla	No, he went home. But he said that Carol could cover for him.
6853	Turk	Is Carol the one with the really firm butt?
6854	J.D.	Well, I'm "Carol", so yes.
6855	Elliot	It's disturbing how obsessed you are with your own butt.
6856	J.D.	Oh, come on. You guys are missing the point: No one is here tonight but us, we are running this hospital.
6857	Turk	This is our house!
6858	Elliot	We're in charge!
6859	J.D.	I love my butt!
6860	J.D.'s Narration	It's amazing how one moment you think you know exactly what you want....
6861	Dr. Cox	Oh, God. Come on.
6862	J.D.'s Narration	...And then the next moment, everything changes.
6863	Carla	Okay, Elliot: The ER doctor knows there's no attending up here, so instead of treating-&-streeting people, he's just admitting everyone. You've got twelve so far.Turk: Oncology, Cardiology, and Pediatrics all need surgical consults...plusThat phone is for you. It's the clinic they, too, know you're on your own so they're just patching all their night calls right on through.And Bambi: Room 201 needs an art-line, Room 202 needs reintubation; plus, Carol, you're needed in ICU to place a femoral swan under flu on Mr. Freed.
6864	J.D.	Never actually...done one of these unsupervised before.
6865	J.D.'s Narration	And that's when I realized, tonight we really were all alone running the hospital.
6866	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
6867	J.D.'s Narration	Luckily, someone had the guts to stand up and take charge.
6868	Carla	Look, you've all been on-call before. So, you don't have a safety-net. Most of the time you don't need one, anyway, right?Fine. I'll just go tell your patients that they're on their own because you're all too scared.
6869	J.D.	No, Carla. I'm the doctor. I should tell them.
6870	Elliot	Come on, peeps! Let's go kick some sick patient ass!
6871	J.D.	That, my friends, is one nerdy honky!
6872	Turk	That's two.

6874	Jordan	My back hurts.
6875	Dr. Cox	Oh, yeah? Well my front hurts, so touche.
6876	Jordan	Ah, always a charmer. Hi.
6877	Dr. Cox	Hi. I'm gonna go ahead and get you a big, ice-cold glass of water. Whatta you think of that?Ohhh, sweet mother of mercy, Carla, you were right. You were so right.
6878	Carla	Of course.
6879	Dr. Cox	Just exactly what in the hell am I supposed to do now?
6880	Carla	Duck.
6881	Dr. Cox	Wha !
6882	Turk	Who let that damn clinic page me 'cause a patient thinks their tongue is too spongy!? Huh!? Who!?
6883	Dr. Cox	Under no circumstances are you to tell any of them that I'm here.
6884	Carla	Yeah, yeah. Look: Why don't you just go home and tell Jordan how you feel.
6885	Dr. Cox	Tell a woman how I feel?
6886	Carla	Well, I guess you could duck.
6887	Dr. Cox	Uh!
6888	Elliot	Carla, this is ridiculous! He admitted out of Cardiology because he has heartburn! I hate ER docs!
6889	Dr. Cox	You just...don't understand my relationship with Jordan.
6890	Carla	Duck.
6891	Dr. Cox	Hah!Now that's just not funny.
6892	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
6893	J.D.'s Narration	I don't know why I was scared of placing a femoral swan, I guess I just couldn't stop wishing there was someone over my shoulder. I was...even starting to see things.
6894	J.D.	Okay, Mr. Freed. I think I can do this.
6895	Mr. Freed	Hm!?
6896	J.D.	I'm gonna need a c-arm in here!
6897	Janitor	Want me to knock him out?
6898	J.D.	What are you doing in here?
6899	Janitor	I owe ya. I'm helping you out.
6900	J.D.	This this isn't like being a janitor, okay! It's not just like something everybody can do.
6901	Janitor	Oh. So you can do my stuff, but I can't do yours.
6902	J.D.	YES!
6903	Janitor	Okay, hotshot, what would you use to get a coffee stain up off a tile floor?
6904	J.D.	I don't know, the...rough side of a sponge?
6905	Janitor	Dammit.
6906	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
6907	Carla	Officer Berson's spiraling a bit.
6908	Elliot	His pulmonary edema seems to be secondary to acute mitral regurgitation. If it turns out to be a __________, he'll need surgery.
6909	Turk	Yeah, but his vitals are so weak, I wouldn't feel confident about taking him to the OR.
6910	J.D.'s Thoughts	Ahh, the classic Catch-22 between Medical and Surgical. Bottom-line, somebody needs to be decisive.
6911	J.D.	Okay, here's the plan: We do nothing.
6912	Elliot	Sounds good.
6913	Turk	I'm in.
6914	Carla	That's inspiring.
6915	J.D.	We'll meet back here in a few hours and see if his vitals have improved.
6916	Turk	Yeah. This ends now.
6917	J.D.'s Narration	Turk should've known that the worst mistake a doctor can possibly make is setting foot in the hospital's free clinic at night.
6918	Turk	I don't care if you do shave down there. That's not even a medical issue! But it sure is pretty!Ma'am, you don't have mono. But you do have halitosis. Mint?Ma'am, three baby Tylenol is actually an under-dose for a woman your size.OH!Yes, congratulations, you _are_ double-jointed.
6919	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
6920	Elliot	Look, I just thought we'd talk to you up here about it so you could see that we don't have any more beds and we really can't handle any more patients.
6921	ER Doc	Okay. You talk way too fast.
6922	Elliot	If you could just keep one person downstairs, we'd be willing to throw a parade for you!
6923	Carla	She needs you to give her a break.
6924	ER Doc	Oh. Well, tell her that we're really swamped.
6925	Carla	She can understand you!
6926	Elliot	Uh-huh! Yeah!
6927	ER Doc	Well then, uh, understand this: Chill out, bitty.
6928	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
6929	Dr. Cox	Hey.
6930	Jordan	Hey. Didn't you go to get water, like, an hour ago?
6931	Dr. Cox	More or less, yeah.Hey, Jordan, there's something I really want to say to you....
6932	Jordan	But can you say it while I'm drinking water? Because I'm really dying of thirst
6933	Dr. Cox	I like you...again. There, you win. You can ahead and do your victory dance or slaughter a goat or whatever it is you do when you're happy.
6934	Jordan	You don't like me.
6935	Dr. Cox	I watch you when you sleep.
6936	Jordan	Well that just gives me the heebie-jeebies.
6937	Dr. Cox	I can't stop thinking about putting up with you.
6938	Jordan	Look: This is pointless, angry, shallow sex! Why would you go and ruin something like that?
6939	Dr. Cox	I'm real sorry, but that's just not enough for me anymore.
6940	Jordan	Sweetie, I have feelings for you, too; I do. But unlike you, I have some balls, so you don't hear me whining about it. Look, Perry, I can't let you back into my life, and watch you personally and professionally sabotage every single chance that you get. It's too hard. I can't do it.
6941	Dr. Cox	I've changed. I have. I see a shrink now; I actually see two, tell you the truth. Good God, what do you want me to do to prove that I'm not that guy anymore?
6942	Jordan	Hmm...
6943	Dr. Kelso	There you are! Had to make me sweat, didn't ya! Good for you, buckaroo. Here. I took the liberty of writing out my introduction.
6944	Dr. Cox	Oh! "Bob Kelso is...the love of my life."
6945	Dr. Kelso	My wife was going to do it.
6946	Dr. Cox	She doesn't even seem to be here, Bob.
6947	Dr. Kelso	Eh. What're you gonna do?
6948	Dr. Cox	Heh!
6949	Jordan	Lovely.
6950	Dr. Cox	Heh.
6951	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
6952	Janitor	You rang. Lurch.
6953	J.D.	Oh. Um. My stethoscope is stuck up there, and I need you to get it down for me.
6954	Janitor	You put it up there.
6955	J.D.	It's really neither here nor there.
6956	Janitor	Fine. All right, we're even.
6957	J.D.	Thank God.
6958	Janitor	You know you could have just asked me to stop hassling you for, like, a year?
6959	J.D.	Okay, I want that, then.
6960	Janitor	It's too late.
6961	J.D.	But I...use those...for listening.
6962	Nurse	Oh, uh, they want you upstairs in room, um, 208.
6963	J.D.	His vitals are exactly the same. There's gotta be one attending in this stupid hospital.
6964	Carla	You guys are unbelievable.
6965	Turk	Oh, thank you, baby.
6966	Carla	Not the good kind.
6967	Turk	I know!
6968	Carla	You all claim you want more responsibility.... But you're being outsmarted by a doctor who wears scrubs made out of hemp; you're afraid to stand up to a volunteer who's answering the clinic phones; and Bambi, did you ever place that femoral swan?
6969	J.D.	It's on my to-do list.
6970	Carla	Now I know you're all hoping Officer Berson's vitals will go up or down and this decision will be made for you, but guess what? Nothing's changed. So it's on you.
6971	J.D.'s Narration	We all knew what we had to do.
6972	J.D.	Surgery.
6973	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes, just making a decision is half the battle.
6974	Lawyer	Gentlemen, we can rebuild him. We have the technology. We can make him better than he was before. Better. Stronger. Faster.Your "zhn-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne"s could be louder. You guys were fine.
6975	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
6976	Dr. Cox	Good evening, everybody. Bob Kelso is....
6977	J.D.'s Narration	In moments of truth, we always reveal who we really are.
6978	Dr. Cox	Bob Kelso is an awful, awful man.I'm not joking. He's the devil. What's wrong with you people? This is
6979	Dr. Kelso	Yeah! Great stuff, Perry! Great stuff! Is this guy a hoot, or what?I'll have your ass for this.
6980	Dr. Cox	Jor Jordan!
6981	Dr. Kelso	Thank you, thank you.
6982	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes, we're our own worst enemy.And sometimes, we rise to the occasion.
6983	J.D.	Everything went, uh, really well.
6984	J.D.'s Narration	Even though we all know that tomorrow morning, the three of us'll go back to being the most unappreciated people in the whole damn hospital.
6985	Nurse	Hey, what are you doing here? I thought you were off last night?
6986	Carla	I switched shifts to help some friends out. Have a good one.Hey, guys! Wait up!
6987	Dr. Kelso	Shut up, Ted, it's morning!
6988	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
6989	Turk	Who wants another beer?
6990	Elliot	Should I have another one? 'Cause I go to work early tomorrow, but I'm having fun now, except I had a pizza earlier and
6991	Turk	Elliot.
6992	Elliot	Yes, please!
6993	Carla	Me too, babe?
6994	J.D.	I'll give you a hand.
6995	J.D.'s Narration	When you spend most of your time together as a part of a group, if you're left alone, it can get pretty awkward. There can be...uncomfortable silences.
6996	Elliot	Th-th-that-that was-that was my tummy.
6997	Carla	Oh, right.
6998	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Murphy, describe the presentation of Ludwig's Angina.
6999	Doug	Uh...
7000	J.D.'s Narration	Still, it's nothing compared to the silence you can hear at work.
7001	Dr. Kelso	Proud to have you on board, son. Anyway, I'm sending one of you to an AMA conference where you're going to eat free food, stay at a nice hotel, and try your darnedest not to embarrass this hospital. And in the interest of fairness, I drew a name out of a hat and that name was Elliot Reid.
7002	Elliot	Yes! I never win at anything!
7003	Dr. Kelso	And then I thought Oh, who cares what I thought the point is, you're not going.You see, it seems as though all you lazy bones have forgotten my edict about residents publishing case reports. That's why I've decided that whoever brings me the most interesting case gets the ticket to Reno.
7004	Doug	You know, sir, my parents live in Reno.
7005	Dr. Kelso	Well, that's just great, sport; I'm sure you'll see them over Christmas.Criminy.
7006	J.D.'s Narration	There aren't many things that can make the Chief of Medicine move that fast. But whenever we get a patient who has the same name as a wing of the hospital, you can pretty much predict Kelso's behavior.
7007	Dr. Kelso	Would you like it, uh, high up on the cheek? Or do you prefer this fleshy part in the middle?
7008	Mrs. Warner	I'm trying to decide who's the most detestable suck-up here - you? This feminine guy with the perm?
7009	Guy	Mom! Please.
7010	Mrs. Warner	Or the one in the corner who can't seem to stop daydreaming.
7011	J.D.	I'm sorry, what?
7012	Mrs. Warner	Oh, great, another sycophant.
7013	Dr. Cox	Listen up, there, Molly Menopause, I need you to quiet the hell down, you're scaring everyone in the hospital. I mean, my God - they're delivering a baby upstairs, and the poor kid's using the umbilical cord to crawl the hell back in.
7014	Mrs. Warner	Now you listen to me
7015	Dr. Cox	I mean it, sister.
7016	Mrs. Warner	Okay. From now on, he's my doctor. The rest of you can get the hell out of here.
7017	Dr. Cox	Scram.
7018	J.D.	Wait. Is that easy to manage?
7019	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
7020	Dr. Cox	Okay, I'm Dr. Cox, and this is...my gal, Friday; she'll be helping me to take care of you but, before we get under way, we're gonna need you to ease up on the yakety-yak.
7021	Mrs. Warner	You can drop the macho act now, dear, they're gone.
7022	Dr. Cox	Yak, schmack, the lips stay zipped.
7023	J.D.	Zipped, schmipped.Oh, I thought we were riffing.
7024	Dr. Cox	Yeah, we're not.
7025	Mrs. Warner	Well, aren't you delicious. If I were twenty years younger and slightly tipsy, this might be your lucky day.
7026	Dr. Cox	Careful, there, sweet-cheeks. I haven't decided which way I'm going to take your temperature yet.
7027	J.D.	Wow. She had some real old-fashioned sass. I mean, you just don't see sass like that anymore.
7028	Dr. Cox	Stop saying sass.
7029	J.D.	Sass.
7030	Doug	Ummmmmmm. Dr. Cox? I have a patient with blennorrhea, and I was wondering if you thought that was interesting enough to present to Dr. Kelso?
7031	Dr. Cox	Gosh, I'm sorry, nervous guy, but I just can't do your work for you. But, what do you say you head on down to the library and look it up in the New England Journal of Who Gives a Rat's Ass? You've got to leave this instant - this second - this moment. Just go.Boy. Now tell me this, muffin: You're not gonna be like all the other mindless drones trying to turn the sniffles into something much more fascinating just so you're the one who's selected to go to this stupid conference, are you?
7032	J.D.'s Narration	I felt I knew the right answer.
7033	J.D.	No...?
7034	Dr. Cox	Ohh! Good girl.
7035	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
7036	Dr. Kelso	Nurse Roberts. I just saw your patient in 106, and I've decided that the next time you place an IV and actually hit the vein on the first try, I'm gonna crack open a bottle of bubbly. I mean, my God, woman, the man looks like Al Jarreau was his nurse.
7037	Nurse Roberts	What?
7038	Dr. Kelso	Isn't he the blind fellow?
7039	Nurse Roberts	You mean Ray Charles?
7040	Dr. Kelso	Dammit. Anyway, you're incompetent.
7041	Nurse Roberts	Easy, Laverne. You're a saved woman!
7042	Carla	Don't worry. Remember tomorrow's his wedding anniversary.
7043	Elliot	Why does that matter?
7044	Dr. Cox	'Cause right about tomorrow, Bob Kelso will be sweeter than flowers dipped in honey.
7045	Dr. Wen	Which is why every year we use this time as an opportunity to ask him for anything our department needs. Like equipment.
7046	Carla	Or an extra nurse on weekends.
7047	Todd	Or a Slip 'n Slide! Who's with me!?
7048	Turk	I don't get it, Dr. Wen. Why would Kelso's anniversary make him less of a jerk than usual?
7049	Dr. Wen	Well, tonight after work, Dr. Kelso will take his wife to a candlelit dinner. Then, after they've toasted to forty wonderful years together, they'll go home and....
7050	Dr. Cox	Oh! Bam! Oh! Bam!
7051	Carla	I actually think it's really sweet that at their age they still....
7052	Dr. Cox	Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!
7053	Turk	And then Bam! Dr. Wen points to me, and now guess who has to go ask Dr. Kelso for a new Argon Laser tomorrow?
7054	Carla	I'm sorry, baby.
7055	Turk	I'm outta here.
7056	Carla	All right.
7057	Turk	Damn Argon Laser.
7058	Elliot	Carla, do you think we'd hang out as much if it weren't for J.D. and Turk?
7059	Carla	Uhhhh.... Probably not. I mean, they are the one thing we have most in common.
7060	Elliot	We have a lot in common! I mean, we both have a hard time digesting dairy!
7061	Carla	You're right! Do you want to be my maid of honor?Elliot. I don't know why you're tying to force this. We're fine! I gotta get back to work.
7062	Elliot	We both work.
7063	Doug	So...have you found any cool cases yet?
7064	J.D.	Look, muffin, I'm not gonna run around this hospital like the rest of you mindless drones trying to turn the sniffles into something fascinating just so you can go to some stupid conference.... Schmonference.
7065	J.D.'s Thoughts	It's fun to rhyme!
7066	Elliot	What's stupid? It's an amazing networking opportunity. Doesn't matter, though, 'cause I've got it wrapped up, anyway.
7067	Doug	Why, do you have something better than my guy with blennorrhea?
7068	Elliot	Doug, if I told you, you would not believe it.And, as you can see, the ass is on the front.
7069	Crowd	Bravo! Bravo!
7070	J.D.	Front butt.... It's like the grail.
7071	Elliot	Oh, did you say something, Mr. Too Scared To Get In The Game?
7072	J.D.'s Thoughts	Don't get sucked in!
7073	J.D.	You know, I have an interesting patient, too.So, basically, Mr. Davis, you received a blunt trauma to the fibrous tissue of the corpus cavernosum.
7074	Mike	Great, and that means....?
7075	J.D.	You broke your penis.
7076	Mike	Wow. I can't wait to get my cast signed.
7077	J.D.	I-I gotta tell you, it's such an unusual case.... Would you mind if I try and get it published in a medical journal?
7078	Mike	That would be fantastic!
7079	J.D.	I'll let you...mull it over. And smile, Mr. Davis - tomorrow's gonna be a better day...for everyone.
7080	Nurse	Dr. Kelso, happy anniversary!Excuse me, sir.
7081	Male Nurse	Sir. Whoa!
7082	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
7083	Elliot	Carla. I figured out why we don't hang out more.
7084	Carla	That's great, Elliot. Pins and needles, really, but I'm prepping a patient for surgery, here.
7085	Elliot	Oh, Mrs. Kellerman's my patient, too. I traded with Doug so we could talk.
7086	Mrs. Kellerman	Oh, are you two friends?
7087	Elliot	We're about to be.
7088	Carla	Oh, my God.
7089	Elliot	You're still stuck on your first impression of me: That I am some narrow-minded, spoiled brat.
7090	Carla	Elliot, not now, okay?
7091	Elliot	When I was a kid, I was really close with my maid.
7092	Carla	That's it.So you think that you totally get my whole experience because you spent time with a Latina woman who cleaned your house?
7093	Elliot	What are you talking about? Our maid was white.
7094	Carla	What was her name?
7095	Elliot	C-Consuela.Look, you know that I don't always say the right thing, but you also know how hard I'm trying! So, yeah, I guess you're right - we have nothing in common, because I only have things in common with nice people.
7096	Carla	Oh, so
7097	Mrs. Kellerman	You two realize I can still hear ya, right?
7098	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
7099	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Carlson, if Pediatrics needs a new bronchoscope, you're gonna get one. Love to the wife and kidlets. Who's next?
7100	Janitor	Hey, do me a favor: Hold my place in line.
7101	J.D.	For how long?
7102	Janitor	Uhh, I don't know.
7103	J.D.	Well, why? What do you have to do?
7104	Janitor	Nothin'. Might just veg.
7105	J.D.	No, seriously, try me I can deal with anything.
7106	Nurse Roberts	Go away.
7107	J.D.	"Go aschmay."
7108	Nurse Roberts	All right, try this one....
7109	Dr. Cox	Angie. Put on your flats, we're going for a walk.
7110	J.D.	"Eat _schmit_ and die."
7111	J.D.'s Narration	Around here, life can be full of surprises. Some are as simple as forgetting something you were supposed to ask for....
7112	Turk	Dr. Kelso! Is he gone?
7113	J.D.'s Narration	Some are so unexpected that everything else takes a back-seat.
7114	Elliot	I'm sorry, Mrs. Kellerman, I don't even know what kind of surgery you're having.
7115	Mrs. Kellerman	I'm getting big, fake breasts.
7116	J.D.'s Narration	And some you never thought you'd hear.
7117	Dr. Cox	Listen, Newbie, I don't tell you I respect you a lot because, well, I don't.
7118	J.D.	I know.
7119	Dr. Cox	But, I gotta say, the fact that you're not jumping through Kelso's hoops like the rest of these peonsYes, you. Forever you. A thousand times you. Move!
7120	Doug	Ow.
7121	Dr. Cox	Anyway, let's make pretend it's your birthday or something, because I'm...ah, hell, I'm impressed.Let's get some coffee.
7122	J.D.'s Thoughts	This is great! There's only one problem.
7123	J.D.'s Narration	You see, ten minutes ago....
7124	Mike	What the hell. Go ahead and use me in your case report.
7125	J.D.	I'm goin' to Reno! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
7126	Dr. Cox	Beg your pardon, Newbie? What are ya thinkin'?
7127	J.D.	Not about Reno.
7128	Dr. Cox	Thatta girl. Let's go.
7129	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
7130	J.D.'s Narration	In every sip of the coffee that Dr. Cox bought me, I could taste my own hypocrisy.Thank God my hypocrisy missed me.
7131	Janitor	The reason I wanted you to stand in line for me is 'cause I needed a new mop. See, the floors are all slippery 'cause this one doesn't work. You know why it doesn't work?
7132	J.D.	It's out of mop gas?
7133	Janitor	No. 'Cause it's so old it won't soak up water.See?
7134	J.D.'s Narration	Something in that filthy mop water woke me up. I decided I could have my cake and eat it, too.Dr. Cox would never know.
7135	Dr. Cox	Whatta ya say, there, bridge club? How ya feelin'?
7136	Mrs. Warner	I feel like crap. What the hell's wrong with me?
7137	Dr. Cox	Your abdominal pain suggests you have biliary disease, but all your tests came back negative so...we don't exactly know what's wrong with you.
7138	J.D.	But don't worry - Dr. Cox and I never say die!Unless, of course, someone actually dies; then we're kind of forced to by law.
7139	Mrs. Warner	He's talking again.
7140	Dr. Cox	Ohh, come on, the kid's okay.
7141	J.D.'s Thoughts	"The kid"? This is great.
7142	Mrs. Warner	So, why haven't I heard your name before?
7143	J.D.	Well, I've only been here a year, and he's actually just started calling me "The Kid" - which I love, by the way.
7144	Dr. Cox	She's talking to me, pumpkin.
7145	J.D.	Okay.
7146	Mrs. Warner	Seriously, you should be more than just an attending; let me make a phone call.
7147	Dr. Cox	I'm...not so good with hand-outs.
7148	Mrs. Warner	Well, come on, I'm only putting in a good word.
7149	Dr. Cox	I'll tell you what, there, bubby: If you really wanna help me, why don't you quiet down and get yourself some rest. And then, if you're a really good girl, I'll wind up your car and take you out to a talkie.
7150	Mrs. Warner	Oh, I could do naughty things to that man.
7151	J.D.	Uncomfortable....

7156	Elliot	You know, 'cause you're so old!
7157	Carla	Yeah, Elliot, she gets that.
7158	Elliot	Yeah, I know! I'm sure she gets it all the time!
7159	Mrs. Kellerman	Look, I've been self-conscious my whole life; and I finally got the courage. Besides, can you two honestly say there's not one thing you'd change about yourself if you could?
7160	Carla	I can honestly say that.
7161	Elliot	Me too.
7162	Mrs. Kellerman	Then you're both liars!

7168	Dr. Kelso	What?
7169	Turk	Nothing.
7170	Dr. Kelso	And you?
7171	J.D.	Nothing, sir. I don't want anything from you, ever.
7172	Dr. Kelso	You know, that's what my son always says. But then when Mother's Day rolls around, guess who wants me to go halvsies on a pasta pot for Enid?
7173	J.D.	Well, sir, I
7174	Dr. Kelso	She's not _my_ mother, dammit!Oh. And don't think that I've forgotten that you have yet to turn in a case report. You have until six.
7175	J.D.	You can't just change your mind!

7188	Carla	Baby. You know I don't like you talkin' to God while we're trying to have a discussion.
7189	Turk	Mm-hmm.
7190	Carla	Now, if I were to be really honest with myself, I would change everything. What do you think?
7191	Turk	Why don't we just skip what I think and jump straight ahead to not having sex for a month?Are all women this crazy?
7192	Elliot's Thoughts	I hate my cheeks. Suck them in.
7193	Elliot	I'll take some of that.

7197	Dr. Cox	Good news, Mrs. Warner: I think we got a pretty good idea what's going on in there....
7198	J.D.'s Thoughts	So I don't have a case to present. At least this way, we get to stay a team.
7199	Dr. Cox	So, anyway, it turns out the EGD showed multiple erosive peptic ulcers, and the secretin injection test was positive, all of which suggest that you have gastrinomas in Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome.
7200	Mrs. Warner	In English, please!
7201	Dr. Cox	Your stomach acid is eroding your own intestines. It's remarkable - I've never actually seen anything like it before. Newbie, you?
7202	J.D.	No.
7203	J.D.'s Narration	And that's when I realized Mrs. Warner was the most interesting case in the hospital.
7204	Dr. Cox	Whole thing's very treatable. We're gonna step outside, and then we'll get underway - how's that sound?Newbie, whatta you say?
7205	J.D.'s Narration	I just had to go for it.
7206	J.D.	Actually, if you could just give me a second, I want to ask Mrs. Warner something.
7207	Dr. Cox	What?
7208	J.D.	To marry me.
7209	Dr. Cox	Come on - heel, toe - whatta you say, kid?
7210	J.D.	Mrs. Warner, I was wondering if you'd give me permission to present your case to possibly be published in a national medical journal, so that I might be chosen to go to an AMA conference.
7211	Mrs. Warner	Sure. Why not.
7212	J.D.	Thanks.Excuse me.

7214	Turk	Excuse me, Dr. Kelso? Could I have a minute of your time?
7215	Dr. Kelso	Oh, for God's sake, son, I have two more days of peace before my wife returns from fat camp.
7216	Turk	Look: I need an argon laser and I was gonna ask you yesterday but then all of a s Hold up. How can you make love to your wife if she's at fat camp?
7217	Dr. Kelso	The real question is, how can I make love to her when she's not at fat camp?
7218	Turk	Sir, you lied to us.
7219	Dr. Kelso	Hi! I'm Bob Kelso, nice to meet you.Look, sport: If people think I'm only giving once a year, they'll only be asking me for things once a year. Capiche? Now get out of my eyeline - Nurse Tisdale's wearing ankle-socks today.
7220	Turk	How 'bout I don't. And how about you help me out, and I won't tell anybody about this. Unless you like it when people come and ask you for stuff, like, every single day.

7227	Elliot	Fine, I'll wait outside.
7228	Carla	No! I'm just talkin' to my hair. I mean, if it's even the least bit humid, all of a sudden I'm Dr. J.
7229	Elliot	Is he in Radiology?
7230	Carla	Yeah! Uh-huh.
7231	Elliot	Carla, you know I would kill for your hair.
7232	Carla	Really?
7233	Elliot	Yeah.
7234	Carla	Well, I would kill for your legs.
7235	Elliot	I would kill for your lips!
7236	Carla	I'd kill for that wagon you're draggin'.That's your butt.

7240	J.D.	I won! Thank you, Mrs. Warner! In your face! In your face! In your...face.
7241	Dr. Cox	Congratulations. You get to represent the Kelso Kennel Club at the big show in Reno. Just remember, when you are posing and prancing in front of the judges, to keep that shaved behind of yours held up nice and high like the proud little puppy that you are. Then when it comes time to hand out those blue ribbons, it'll be such an exciting time for you - it really will be - but for the love of God, Newbie, you gotta try, try, try not to squeeze out a dookie on the astroturf. Because, uh, I mean, God forbid you were ever an embarrassment to Master Bob, right?
7242	J.D.	You know, I don't care what you think.
7243	Dr. Cox	Yeah, you do.
7244	J.D.	I know.Look, I wanna be like you...but a more successful you. There's nothing wrong with playing the game once in a while.Tell you what: Ten years form now, when I'm your boss, I'll go ahead and throw in a good word for you and you won't even have to ask........sir.
7245	J.D.'s Narration	I like to think that your life comes down to the choices you've made along the way.Like standing up to a superior.Or the choice to focus on what you have in common, instead of what you don't.Or the choice to let someone help you, for once.In the end, you just have to trust your decisions.
7246	Todd	You're the husband? We've gotta get you some bigger hands.
7247	J.D.'s Narration	And hopefully, you'll land on solid ground
7248	J.D.	Well what about your new mop?!
7249	Janitor	I like the old one.
7250	J.D.	But you cried!
7251	Janitor	No, that was you.

7253	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
7254	J.D.	Mr. Hogan, I can't stress enough how much you gotta avoid the red meat. Cirrhosis of your liver is preventing it from filtering out all the toxins, and if those get to your brain you'd become encephalopathic leading to a mental status change.
7255	Mr. Hogan	So, what, I'm gonna start acting all crazy or something?
7256	J.D.	Well, you'll need a tin-foil hat to hold in all your thoughts.
7257	Mr. Hogan	But I can still have a tiny, little bite of my wife's carne asada, right?
7258	J.D.	Well....
7259	J.D.'s Narration	The greatest thing about Carla is I always know I can count on her to be the bad cop.
7260	Carla	What part of "no meat" don't you understand?
7261	Mr. Hogan	Well, I just thought that
7262	J.D.	Carla!
7263	Carla	So if you don't listen to Dr. Dorian, you're gonna have to answer to me.
7264	Mr. Hogan	Okay! Ix-nay on the eat-may.
7265	Carla	That's right.
7266	J.D.'s Narration	We're a team.
7267	Carla	What?
7268	J.D.	"Eat-may" sounds like "eat me."
7269	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, on some teams, there's gonna be friction.
7270	Dr. Wen	All right...we're done here. Bonnie, you close.
7271	Turk	Damn!
7272	Bonnie	Aw, don't be mad. Just be the good little beeyotch you are and wipe the sweat off my forehead.
7273	Turk	Look, don't say "beeyotch", you can't pull it off which is interesting, being that you're the queen mother of all
7274	Bonnie	Dr. Wen? My forehead's feeling a little misty.
7275	Dr. Wen	Dr. Turk, are your hands broken?
7276	Turk	No.Here you go.
7277	Bonnie	Mmm. That's nice...beeyotch.
7278	J.D.'s Narration	And some teams, well, they never really seem to get together.
7279	Elliot	Dr. Cox! I'm so glad I caught you! I need
7280	Dr. Cox	And there it is again that ringing in my ears. It's kind of an "Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!" but it's more piercing, more of an "Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!"
7281	J.D.	She's trying to ask you a question.
7282	Dr. Cox	Now you, you're more of a low-pitched "Ooga-ooga-ooga." It's more masculine, which, quite frankly, is surprising considering the source, but make no mistake oh, just equally annoying! Luckily, though, I know how to make the pain go away!Ahhhh. Much better.
7283	Elliot	Can you believe that!? I mean, every time we even try to talk to him, he starts going off on one of these random tangents and....
7284	J.D.'s Thoughts	Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
7285	Elliot	You know?
7286	J.D.	Clearly we're on the same page.
7287	Elliot	We're residents now, we should be treated more like colleagues, and I can't even get him to notice me.Oh, God! Oh! Uh! Sorry, sorry, sorry!

7293	Janitor	I always get this way in the fall, you know summer's gone, the days are shorter; it just makes me feel so...what's the word....
7294	J.D.	Sad?
7295	Janitor	Yes, that's it. I'm a janitor, so I couldn't think of the word "sad." I was gonna say, It makes me feel so "mop."
7296	J.D.	Let me explain, I
7297	Janitor	Go ahead, I'm "mopping."
7298	J.D.	Maybe I shouldn't bother.
7299	Janitor	Maybe you "mopn't."
7300	J.D.'s Narration	I guess after a while, you just stop being surprised by people.
7301	Mr. Hogan	Yeah...I-I-I'm going to be needing a room.Well, who can say no to 49-cent cheeseburgers?
7302	Carla	Sure, but tack on the cost of medicine, your room, and pumping your stomach, and that 49-cent cheeseburger is gonna run you in the neighborhood of thirteen hundred dollars.
7303	Mr. Hogan	Heh. See, that's how they get you.
7304	Carla	That's right.
7305	Nurse Roberts	Carla, your brother called.
7306	Carla	Oh, cool.
7307	J.D.	I didn't know you had a brother.
7308	Carla	That's my pet-name for Turk you know, 'cause he's mine and he's a black man: "My bruthah."
7309	J.D.	That is adorable. Do you think he'd mind if I call him that, too?
7310	Carla	J.D., I was kidding.
7311	J.D.	I know. I'm still gonna ask. So, how come I don't know anything about your family?
7312	Carla	I don't know. I g I'm just not big on sharing my personal life with people.

7318	J.D.	Wow.

7324	Carla	Can we please talk about something other than Bonnie?
7325	Elliot	I think you should give Bonnie a break. You know, it's really hard being a woman around here...you can walk through walls and nobody notices you.
7326	J.D.	Not entirely unlike a...ninja!
7327	Turk	Whatever. I'm out.

7335	Dr. Cox	It...was...rhetorical. If you if you'd tell Mrs. Tillman that I'll be right out, that would be just...terrific.
7336	Elliot	Dr. Cox! Um, Mr. Tillman is my patient, too, you know.
7337	Dr. Cox	He is?
7338	Elliot	Yeah, I was in the room with you this morning, remember?
7339	Dr. Cox	Uhhh, no.
7340	Elliot	Well, I was. Anyway, um, I if you want, I could talk to his wife, because I...just really enjoy that kind of stuff.
7341	Dr. Cox	Wait a minute: Are you actually saying you enjoy telling people their spouses are going to die?
7342	Elliot	....Yep! I mean, I know that that sounds a little bit weird, but I-I-I-I just really like being there for people; it's...kind of why I became a doctor in the first place.

7346	Carla	Dr. Kelso, if you're here to do one of your "How are my girls today, now let me tell you some things you don't want to hear" routines, I should warn you: I'm in a mood. So it's probably in your best interest to make up some lame excuse, turn around, and leave.
7347	Dr. Kelso	Young lady, I will not be spoken to like that! Luckily, for you, I have to go see Mrs. Pfitztuffulla down in Pfofferoptrics.
7348	Carla	Atta boy.
7349	J.D.	Rough day, huh? Well, maybe it would help to share...with someone?
7350	Carla	Okay. You want in? You want me to open up?
7351	J.D.	I think I can handle it.
7352	Carla	Fine!I don't like the way I look. I don't like the way I think. I don't like the way I feel about how I look. ...I have too much hair, my boobs are too low, my butt is too big, and I'm so short!Plus, when I work up this morning, I cried for like half an hour because I thought I was getting wrinkles, but it turns out I just fell asleep on Turk's corduroy pants!
7353	J.D.	Wow.
7354	Carla	There. Now you think I'm the craziest woman here.

7360	Bonnie	Okay. How _does_ that feel?
7361	Turk	Damn!
7362	Dr. Kelso	Doctors! Something I've taken great pride in over the years is Sacred Heart's involvement in the esteemed "Doctors Without Borders" program. Now, every year, I single out the most qualified surgical resident to accompany me to Mexico for a weekend. Anyway, I've made my decision....

7372	Carla	Then why is he doing his "You're so getting a piece of this" dance?
7373	J.D.	He's not! That's his "In your face" dance.... Or it's his "There's a sale on lotion" dance. I dunno; he's got so many dances.

7457	J.D.	So, we're even, right?
7458	Carla	Even. I told a nurse you switched her shifts you babbled all my crazy to the person I plan on spending the rest of my life with!
7459	J.D.	Well, I could've spent the rest of my life with Lauren! ...Or at least with her tushie. I just want to wash it is that weird?
7460	Carla	You think this is funny?
7461	J.D.	Come on....
7462	Carla	I told you how hard it is for me to let my guard down, and that quick, you burn me. Never again.

7465	Turk	Bonnie. I found out that Dr. Wen actually recommended you for that trip to Mexico. I'm sure you know how hard it is for me to stand here and admit that to you, so I was hoping that we can use this as an opportunity to repair our relationship. What do you say?
7466	Bonnie	Blaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
7467	Turk	Oh, my God. Okay, fine! Look, _you_ go to Mexico; okay? And, by the way, "dolor en el asno" means "pain in the ass" I thought it would help you when you introduce yourself.
7468	Bonnie	I don't want your charity! You go. And every second you're down there, I want you to think about how I kick your ass up and down these halls all day long. Now...where was I?

7473	Elliot	All all of these are your patients?
7474	Dr. Cox	No, but when word got about your little offer, a bunch of other docs wanted in.
7475	Elliot	Oh, great! More for me!I'm afraid you have hepatitis.Meningitis?Esophageal gastro duodenal colitis.Yes, it's like being blind in one eye...except you'll be blind in both.I'm really sorry, um...there's nothing more that we can do.

7480	J.D.	All right, look: Okay, I never meant to insinuate you guys were stupid, all right? Everyone knows you're a hundred times smarter than the jackasses that run this place.
7481	Dr. Kelso	Is that so, sport?
7482	J.D.	No, sir. It's not so. Ooh..Would you just go ahead and answer it, already! Hello?

7488	Mr. Hogan	Well, what would you do if your five-year-old son begged you to have a bite of his dinner?
7489	Carla	You had two dozen ribs!
7490	Mr. Hogan	I know.... I don't even have a kid.
7491	Carla	That's it, I've I've had enough. This is ridiculous.
7492	J.D.	Will you lay off Mr. Hogan? So he made a mistake, all right, people make mistakes. When they do, it wouldn't hurt you to cut them some slack once in a while.
7493	Mr. Hogan	Thanks, man.
7494	J.D.	Quiet; this isn't about you! Don't eat meat!Carla! Look, every time you screwed up with me, I've totally let you off the hook.
7495	Carla	When have I ever screwed up with you?
7496	J.D.	Okay, never. But we both know that if you ever did, I would give you a break. Now let's see how you like it when I walk away from you.Actually, I need to go this way.Right the first time.

7498	Elliot	Awesome!
7499	Dr. Cox	Awww..... You're gonna love this one! Twenty-five-year-old woman dancer, actually...well, not anymore, I'm afraid we have to take both of her legs bilateral gangrene and seeing as her husband recently passed away, and her insurance at the dancer's union probably is not gonna cover it, you should go ahead and tell her she won't be able to stay here with us for her rehab.
7500	Elliot	Um, what...room is she in?
7501	Dr. Cox	There is no room. In fact, in the history of medicine, there's never actually been a patient that depressing. I made it up! Come on, now, Barbie; you keep going down this road, you're gonna go up to the roof of this hospital and jump the hell off. Mind you, it's only five stories high, so that means you'll just wind up back down here, where I, of course, will be the one who has to treat you, and then I'll be forced to jump off the roof of this hospital, which, as I was suggesting to you, is only five stories high, and are you starting to see a pattern forming here?
7502	Elliot	I just wanted to be colleagues.
7503	Dr. Cox	Barbie, as long as you stay and work at this hospital, I'm always gonna be your superior.... That's just the way it goes. Don't get me wrong, you can keep trying to connect with me; I mean, hell, you're...you're so damn entertaining you just might make some head-way. But still, you might be better served and, this is a crazy notion if you could stop worrying so much about who does and doesn't notice...you. Even for a second...that'd be good; that'd be real good.
7504	J.D.'s Narration	I think every day is made up of tiny little tests.Some are tests of character.Some are tests of fortitude.Others are tests of friendship.
7505	Carla	I spoke to my brother today.
7506	J.D.	Really?
7507	Carla	Mm-hmm. He's having some problems.
7508	J.D.'s Narration	And if you're lucky, when it really matters, you'll pass with flying colors.

7511	J.D.'s Narration	Work seems different now that I'm a resident; I feel more confident, more like a hell, I'll say it a doctor.
7512	J.D.	Good morning, people!You're gonna be fine, ma'am.
7513	Lady	I work here.
7514	J.D.	That still doesn't change the fact that you're gonna be fine!
7515	Dr. Cox	Why...in the hell are you wearing a coat?
7516	J.D.	'Cause I'm a doctor.
7517	Dr. Cox	Look, Babs, if you're truly worried about people seeing your ass, just go ahead and do what all the other girls do and tie a sweater around your waist.
7518	J.D.	Well, I look doctorly!
7519	Dr. Cox	No, you look like the guy who goes to a garage sale, buys a bronze star, pins it to his lapel, and then tells everybody to call him "Sarge." And Newbie, nobody likes that guy. Not a soul.
7520	Janitor	I was in the military.
7521	J.D.	Where did you come from!?
7522	Janitor	If I find out you're wearing a bronzie, without having served, I'm gonna make things uncomfortable for you.
7523	J.D.'s Thoughts	Coat-wearing doctors do not take this crap.
7524	J.D.	You were never in the military.
7525	Janitor	Yes, I was.
7526	J.D.	Which branch?
7527	Janitor	The...janitor branch.
7528	J.D.	I'm watching you.That's right, Sasquatch.
7529	J.D.'s Narration	You see, things have changed.We've begun to adapt to new situations.
7530	Turk	Oh, my back is on fire. If Dr. Amato was any shorter, I'd be passing him instruments with my feet.
7531	Dr. Amato	Dr. Turk, I need you down here.
7532	Turk	Coming down.

7534	J.D.'s Narration	Even other people are starting to see us differently.
7535	Dr. DiStefano	Hey there, Doctor.
7536	Elliot	Oh, me! Of course, because I'm a I'm a doctor. I mean I I've got the, uh, I've got the outfit. I've got the, uh, heart, uh, hearing thingie.
7537	Dr. DiStefano	Uh, "stethoscope."
7538	Elliot	Oooh, paging Dr. Know It All to the cafeteria!
7539	Turk	Ohhh, sweet baby James.
7540	J.D.'s Narration	Most importantly, we've started to treat each other with respect.
7541	Turk	Dude, you are such a loser, man.
7542	J.D.	I think I look spiffy. I'm trying to separate myself from the whole pack.
7543	Carla	Oh, you already have, Bambi you're the biggest geek to ever come through here.
7544	Turk	Yeah, he is.
7545	Carla	Don't laugh you're the jocky frat-boy with a back problem.
7546	Turk	Yeah, I am.
7547	Elliot	Oh, do me! Do me! Do me!
7548	J.D.	You're gonna want to be careful about yelling that out in a bar.
7549	Elliot	I'm serious! All you guys get to be something: The dork, the jock, the spicy firecracker from the school of hard knocks. No offense, Carla. Dammit, what am I?
7550	Carla	You're white.
7551	Turk	The whitest.
7552	J.D.	Yeah, you are.
7553	Elliot	Oh, come on, J.D.'s white!
7554	J.D.	I ain't hearin' that, woman, 'cause I'm talkin' to him.

7558	Mr. Blair	You got me in the I.C.U. for a cold?
7559	J.D.	Mr. Blair, you have a severe sinus infection, with orbital extension; you were admitted delirious from your hundred-and-six degree temperature, completely naked and very adamant about staying that way.
7560	Mr. Blair	I was hot.
7561	Nurse Roberts	I'll second that. Mm-hmmm....
7562	Dr. Kelso	Sharp coat, sport.
7563	J.D.	Oh, yeah. It's spiffy!
7564	Dr. Cox	Shocker, Big Bob you care more about appearances than actual
7565	Dr. Kelso	Better finish that thought quickly, Perry, I'm not breaking my gait.
7566	Dr. Cox	Just saying: Substance, style, what's important, coat, not
7567	Dr. Kelso	Ha! Ha! Ha! Too slow!
7568	J.D.	Think you really got through to him.Oh, my God, you hear like a bat!
7569	J.D.'s Thoughts	Idiot! I wish I had a guy in my life that would stop me before I did something stupid.I don't know why he's an opera singer.
7570	Dr. Cox	Listen closely, Tiny Dancer: I wouldn't be flapping my mouth if I'd forgotten to get a blood culture on Mr. Blair. And, for the love of God, do you at least remember what you were doing the day they were passing out common sense? Oh, gosh, maybe you were running late that day 'cause you just couldn't find the right thong for those low-rider jeans that you love so much, or maybe you were busy bopping along to whatever boy band really makes your heart race nowadays, and you just drove on by. 'Course, I don't know, I'm just guessing, but one things' sure-shootin': you wound up at the dumb-dumb store and you just went ahead and put so much of that into the car that you could fit, didn't ya?
7571	J.D.'s Narration	And then, I did something I've never done before....
7572	J.D.	Look, Doctor: If you flip the page on that chart, you'd see that I pan-cultured him yesterday; but that would probably get in the way of the perverse pleasure you take in pointing out other peoples' slip-ups. Well, too bad, Buster Brown! Because I'm a resident now, and I'm not gonna be making the same little silly intern mistakes I made last year. I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't stand here and yell at me in front of my patient.
7573	Dr. Cox	"Buster Brown."
7574	J.D.	"Buster Brown."

7579	Carla	You go ahead and take your time.
7580	Dr. Amato	Hey, there, big fella. Just checked the board we're together on a thyroidectomy
7581	Turk	Oh, that's great, Dr. Amato.
7582	J.D.	Domo arigato, Dr. Amato.How is that not funny?
7583	Turk	I don't know, dude.
7584	J.D.	You know, you guys are getting to be like Starsky and Hutch.
7585	Turk	That'd be true if Starsky was a ventriloquist and Hutch was a tiny puppet.
7586	J.D.	I would watch that show.
7587	Turk	Yeah.
7588	J.D.	Why do you keep ending up with that guy?
7589	Turk	Because the other surgeons are busting my chops for skipping guys' night out.
7590	J.D.	Oh, what, ending up with Dr. Amato is like a punishment or something?
7591	Turk	No, dude; I actually enjoy needing you to lower me on the toilet in the morning.
7592	J.D.	Check that out.
7593	J.D.'s Narration	I know it looks innocent, but Elliot was late this morning. Plus, once you've been here a while, you learn to read between the lines.

7597	Elliot	Well, Mrs. Bumbry, I wish I had better news, but, unfortunately, you didn't qualify for the G.I. clinical trial, so we'll just keep plugging away.

7599	Elliot	What guy? I was I wa I was I wasn't
7600	Carla	Elliot. I have other patients, Mrs. Bumbry needs a nap, we're all very busy....
7601	Elliot	I have never done anything like this; I just met him and slept with him! POW!
7602	Mrs. Bumbry	God, I miss one-night stands.
7603	Elliot	The best thing was, since I knew it was just a fling, I wasn't afraid to ask him for exactly what I wanted.
7604	Carla	Which was?
7605	Elliot	Shirt on, lights off, no talking.
7606	Carla	Well, you just be careful you wouldn't believe how quickly a reputation can be made in this hospital.
7607	Mrs. Bumbry	You're a bit of a slut, aren't you!

7609	Cut to	Admissions
7610	Elliot	Wait a minute. _I'm_ Elliot Reid. People! Listen up! This rumor ends right now!
7611	Nurse Roberts	She slept with him, and she hardly knew him.
7612	Mr. Blair	Does that happen a lot around here?
7613	Nurse Roberts	Not enough.
7614	J.D.	Mr. Blair, that infection keeps hanging around so I wanna put you on a broader spectrum antibiotic that we'll administer intravenously.
7615	Mr. Blair	But I'm feeling a lot better.
7616	J.D.	I'm gonna tell you something my mom used to tell me whenever I was scared: In the case of severe sinus infection not responding to a three-day cycle of antibiotics, the recommended protocol is Imipenem, 500 milligrams, I.V.q. six hours. Got me through a lot of hard times.
7617	J.D.'s Narration	I love it that Mr. Blair trusted me. It's one of the best feelings you can have as a doctor.
7618	Janitor	How's it goin'?
7619	J.D.	You can't wear that!
7620	Janitor	What, you mean after Labor Day? Eh.
7621	J.D.	You know what I mean!
7622	Janitor	It's a white coat. Anybody can wear a white coat.
7623	J.D.	Jerk!

7626	Dr. Cox	So, Mrs. Bumbry, here, has inflammatory bowel disease, huh?
7627	Carla	Yeah; and the new drug they're testing at the clinical trial could really help her out but, of course, she doesn't qualify.
7628	Dr. Cox	Right.
7629	Carla	You okay, Mrs. Bumbry?
7630	Mrs. Bumbry	I liked Bow Wow when he was Lil' Bow Wow.
7631	Dr. Cox	Oh, she's right rappers, they grow up so fast.Look, Carla, if you're gonna survive in medicine, you've got to accept the fact that rules are rules. Hey! Anyone from that clinical trial around? Hello? Hello?Yeah, this lady's supposed to be in this trial.
7632	Orderly	Okay.
7633	Carla	What the hell did you just do?
7634	Dr. Cox	When you speak of this and I know you will could I be shirtless? See, I think it would be more impressive if I was shirtless.
7635	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
7636	J.D.	Look, all I'm saying is, if you are a criminal, even if you aren't afraid of Starsky, if you round a corner and a tiny little Hutch puppet jumps out at your face "Freeze, sucka!" you're done for, it's over.
7637	Turk	Does it have a real gun or a puppet gun?
7638	J.D.	Puppet gun. They'd sew it to its hand.
7639	Turk	Okay, I'd watch that.What's up, fellas!
7640	J.D.'s Narration	I don't care what hospital you go to, Surgery is still a boys' club.
7641	J.D.'s Thoughts	I'm just as cool as those guys.
7642	J.D.	Bye, Turk!!!
7643	Todd	T-Dog, settle a little medical debate for us: I think Elliot's got a modest rack, at best; but my favorite attending, here, says that when he was "tuning in Tokyo" the other night, the reception was excellent!
7644	Turk	You guys, Elliot's a friend of mine, so I really don't want to talk about that, okay?
7645	Dr. DiStefano	So, Dr. Turk, how is your back?
7646	Turk	My back's as swollen as Elliot's big-ass breasts, sir.
7647	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
7648	J.D.	I was paged?
7649	Nurse Roberts	The patient's complaining of anosmia.
7650	J.D.	Anosmia? You know, I always thought it was very funny that losing your sense of smell was called "anosmia." "A-_nos_-mia", you know, like "_schnoz_mia." Don't you find that very funny?He doesn't.
7651	Nurse Roberts	I'm calling Dr. Cox.
7652	J.D.	Whoa; nobody needs to go call Dr. Cox.
7653	Mr. Blair	This is only temporary, right?
7654	J.D.	'Course it's temporary. It could also be slightly more un-temporary.
7655	Mr. Blair	You mean "permanent."
7656	J.D.'s Narration	Just when you think you have this place figured out, it finds a new way to get you.
7657	Dr. Cox	I'm waiting.
7658	Lawyer	Unfortunately, you've, uh, put us in somewhat of a legal bind.
7659	Dr. Kelso	Way to go, Ted. My God, man, you couldn't scare a child.
7660	Lawyer	Who who would want to?
7661	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Cox, do you have any idea how much money this hospital makes from that G.I. trial into which you took the liberty of enrolling your patient?
7662	Dr. Cox	I'm gonna go ahead and guess: Seven dollars.
7663	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes it comes right at you.
7664	Dr. Kelso	Keep smiling, tough guy. First I'm going to report you to the Ethics
7665	Dr. Cox	Better finish that thought there, Bobcat, 'cause I'm not breaking my gait.
7666	Dr. Kelso	What are you looking at?
7667	Lawyer	Nothing.
7668	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes it sneaks up on you.
7669	Turk	Plus, when she dated J.D., she would just wear a t-shirt in the morning; so when she reached up high to grab a box of cereal, everybody in the room got two scoops of booty-flakes; and the two scoops they were packed with flavor. You know what I'm sayin'! Right? Right? Right!
7670	Mr. Blair	I told you I didn't want these antibiotics. Tell you what: When your first grand-kid is born, you pick him up and you smell his head, why don't you give me a call and tell me how great it is?
7671	J.D.	Mr. Blair, I'm really sorry this happened.
7672	J.D.'s Narration	And sometimes, it hits you in places you didn't even know you were vulnerable.
7673	Mr. Blair	Yeah, well you should be. It's your fault.

7680	Lawyer	Oh, God, you cut off someone's nose!? Where is it? Do you have it on you? You're disgusting!
7681	J.D.	No, I-I just gave him I.V. Imipenem.
7682	Lawyer	Kelso's gonna blame me. Just...get rid of the nose!
7683	J.D.	Ted, I don't I don't have the nose. Maybe you should just calm down.
7684	Lawyer	MAYBE _YOU_ SHOULD CALM DOWN!
7685	J.D.	My bad.
7686	Lawyer	Imipenem...Imipenem...Imipenem...."Unlike Gentamicin and Tetracycline, Imipenem has never been associated with anosmia." My God, we're okay. We're okay.

7699	Dr. Amato	Stop it. All I'm saying is that it's possible to be a good surgeon without playing their game, okay?

7706	Noelle	No....
7707	Elliot	Then what is it, Noelle, what do you want?
7708	Noelle	I just wanted to know where the G-Spot is.
7709	Elliot	The what-spot?
7710	Dr. Cox	And for the hundredth time: You're right, you had absolutely nothing to do with me getting involved in this Mrs. Bumbry case. But, for God's sake, Carla, the much bigger problem facing us right now is just exactly how do we get you to stop annoying me?
7711	Carla	Oh, yeah, I'm the problem. Look: Can't you just, for once, stay out of your own way?

7735	Carla	Mrs. Bumbry's fifty-three.
7736	Dr. Kelso	Mrs. who is what?
7737	Carla	The patient Dr. Cox got in to the G.I. clinical trial. She was disqualified because her chart said she was sixty-three, and the cut-off is fifty-five. But, the genius who admitted her calculated her age wrong; she's actually a perfect candidate.
7738	Dr. Kelso	And Dr. Cox knew this?
7739	Carla	He knew the whole time.
7740	Dr. Kelso	Fan-damn-tastic. Sweetheart, you'd better do the old heel-toe out of here, because you know as well as I do I'm going to take this out on somebody.
7741	Carla	Bye-bye!
7742	Lawyer	May I, uh, join you?
7743	Dr. Kelso	By all means!

7745	J.D.'s Narration	Armed with the knowledge that I was right and he was wrong, I thought I'd enjoy this walk more. Still, I couldn't help but empathize, because I've been there, and I saw the signs: The shameful, averted gaze....The nervous shifting....And, of course, the wild, uncontrollable urination.
7746	Dr. Cox	Gosh, I'm thrilled you approve, but, for the last time: I'm up here. I'm up here. I'm up here!
7747	J.D.	You were wrong and I was right.
7748	Dr. Cox	I beg your pardon?
7749	J.D.	Anosmia isn't a side-effect of I.V. Imipenem. Plus, Mr. Blair had multiple nasal polypectomies, and septoplasty; and his loss of smell is most likely caused by repeated manipulation of the sinuses along with concurrent infection. So, I didn't make a mistake; and you were wrong when you said, "Nice goin', Newbie."
7750	Dr. Cox	Here you've put me in a tough situation: I can't honestly decide whether to say, "Duh," uh, "Doy," or a very sarcastic, "Oh, really?" My God, Fiona, I know it wasn't your fault; hell, the patient probably knows! But he seemed a little distraught, like maybe being able to blame somebody for a second or two just might make him feel a little better? And, I know, maybe it's me, but doesn't that seem like something that goes right along with wearing that fancy white coat? It...does, doesn't it.
7751	J.D.	kinda.
7752	Dr. Cox	Gosh, I'm so proud of ya. Put her there.Woof.
7753	J.D.'s Thoughts	"Woof"?
7754	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
7755	Elliot	That girl just asked me to give her my top ten sexual positions; and, after the two that I knew, I just started naming insects.
7756	Turk	Elliot, that really sucks; I'm sorry.
7757	Elliot	I'm not sure. I mean, I was mad at you at first, but it's actually kind of empowering, you know, to have this...persona this identity. I mean, I'm not just some, you know, nameless, faceless white doctor I'm Elliot Reid: Tramp.
7758	Turk	Wow. That's great! If you're happy, I'm happy.
7759	Elliot	The weird thing is, she said she'd already tried "Stink-bug."
7760	J.D.'s Narration	I still don't know why I was so desperate for everyone to know it wasn't my fault.
7761	Carla	Dr. Cox, Dr. Kelso has something he wants to say to you.
7762	Dr. Kelso	So, uh, I hear there was an age mix-up that I was not aware of. And, umm...anyway, uhh....
7763	Carla	You're okay.
7764	Dr. Kelso	I'm sorry.
7765	J.D.'s Narration	I guess it comes down to how we want to be seen by other people.
7766	Dr. Cox	Well, I'm proud of you, Robert. Put her there.Woof.Oh, and I think it's important you understand that I had no idea how old that patient was, and, for the record, she could've been a hundred-and-seventy I still woulda stuck her in that trial so fast, it'd make your teeth fall out all over again.
7767	Carla	That's perfect.
7768	Dr. Cox	I would, too!
7769	J.D.'s Narration	Some people want to be seen as the rebel.Some people just want to be seen, period.Some people have limits on how far they'll go to protect their image.
7770	Dr. Amato	Dr. Turk, I need you down here.
7771	Turk	Coming.
7772	J.D.'s Narration	For me, it was when I stopped worrying about how other people saw me that I finally started to look better.
7773	J.D.	Oh, Mr. Blair, I just wanted to say again that I made a mistake, and I'm sorry.
7774	Mr. Blair	It's all right.
7775	J.D.	Good luck.
7776	Nurse Roberts	Come on, baby. Let's see if we can find you a ride.
7777	J.D.	Laverne! Careful.
7778	Janitor	Oh, so we're done with the coats?? All right. Well, it was a fun day, though, wasn't it? See you tomorrow.
7779	J.D.	Well, you know, maybe tomorrow, I'll get a bad hair-cut and push around a mop all day!I know you don't have to do it, okay?Yeah.
7780	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
7781	J.D.'s Narration	Even close friends disagree about decisions.
7782	Turk	How 'bout this one?
7783	J.D.	You want to get a _clear_ shower curtain? Why don't I just nude up in the living room and you can spray me down with a hose.
7784	Turk	Dude, if you're gonna be that self-conscious, I could always doodle in chest hairs right about where you'd stand.
7785	J.D.	I have a chest hair.... I named him Clancy.
7786	J.D.'s Narration	And then it happened....
7787	Sales Girl	Can I help you, sir?
7788	Her voice echoes	Sir?...Sir?...Sir?...Sir?...Sir?...Sir?...
7789	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
7790	J.D.	I can't believe she called me "sir."
7791	Turk	She called me "mister."
7792	Carla	Maybe it's because you're bald?
7793	Turk	I'm not bald I shave my head.
7794	Carla	Well, then, let it grow back.
7795	Turk	Careful, honey!
7796	J.D.	We're practically kids!
7797	Elliot	Really? Well, what are you doing for Halloween tomorrow night?
7798	Turk	Well, we used to dress up as pigs and hit every bar in town?
7799	J.D.	Yeah! You have not lived until you've seen a drunken pig do The Robot.
7800	Carla	She didn't ask what you used to do, she asked what you're doing _this_ Halloween.
7801	Turk	We got plans!
7802	J.D.	Big plans!
7803	Elliot	Watch T.V. and sleep?
7804	Turk	Yeah, pretty much.
7805	J.D.	Oh, I may take a bath first.
7806	Turk	Bubbles?
7807	J.D.	Give me some!
7808	J.D.'s Narration	It was sad, 'cause I started to think I'd never feel like a kid again.
7809	Guy	Arrgghh! Hey-hey-hey, little brother! It's the head-lockin' Dan!
7810	J.D.	What the hell are you doing here!?
7811	Dr. Cox	You know, it's funny, Vivian, I was just going to ask you the exact same question, seeing as how I paged you four minutes and thirty-eight seconds ago.
7812	J.D.	Dr. Cox, this is my big brother, Dan! He just showed up unexpected!
7813	Dr. Cox	Heh. Four minutes and forty-four seconds.
7814	Dan	Whoa, whoa; easy, there, chief! Why don't we have one of those nurses, there, pour you a big, tall glass of calm down juice.
7815	J.D.	Dan, um...mm-mm, mm-mm.
7816	Dr. Cox	You know, Newbie, it's so interesting I found I couldn't sleep last night, so, in order to pass the time, I started to make a list of things that annoy me more than you. Anyway, I came up with people who call Wednesdays "hump day" and, of course, all Sandra Bullock movies.But now, I'm thrilled to announce, your brother tops the list, which is
7817	Dan	Hey, chief! Does this speech have an intermission? 'Cause I gotta go to the lobby and take a wizz.
7818	Dr. Cox	Aaaactually, I'm not so keen on nicknames from guys that barely know me!
7819	Dan	Aaaaactually, why don't you tell me what you keen on?
7820	J.D.	Oh, Dan, no.
7821	Dan	Where's the crapper?
7822	Carla	So, Dan, what brings you to town?
7823	Dan	Oh, some guy hired me to fly here, drive his Mercedes back I figure it's an easy way to pick up some extra cash.
7824	Carla	Oh. Plus, you get to hang out with Bambi!
7825	J.D.'s Thoughts	Maybe he'll let that go....
7826	Dan	Bambi?
7827	J.D.	Well, you know, it's a term of endearment that only Carla uses.
7828	Dan	I respect that, Bambi.
7829	Carla	Well, that's smart, because you do not want to get on Bambi's bad side and suffer the wrath of Bambi! Brrr!
7830	J.D.	Why are you here?
7831	Carla	Oh, uh, Room 310's test came back negative, I thought you might want to give him the good news.
7832	Dan	Let me do it.
7833	J.D.	What?
7834	Dan	I can totally be a doctor.
7835	J.D.	I can't let you tell him!
7836	Dan	I won't call you Bambi anymore.Touch-and-go there for a while. You're a fighter! You pulled through. We're gonna get you out of here today, but! I'd like you to keep an eye on those......rickles.
7837	Patient	Rickles is my last name.
7838	Dan	You bet it is. Do you have kids?
7839	Patient	Yeah, two.
7840	Dan	That's what I'm saying. Let's keep an eye on the little Rickles children are our future!
7841	J.D.	Doctor, it's an emergency, we need you right away.
7842	Dan	Dammit, Bambi, I'm busy! So hard to find a good male nurse these days. Am I right?
7843	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
7844	J.D.	You need to understand, Elliot, Dan wasn't just the captain of every team he was like the mayor of our high school. The jocks dug him, the burn-outs dug him, the nerds, like, worshipped him!
7845	Elliot	What about you?
7846	Dan	He mentioned the nerds.
7847	J.D.	See, why hurt me?
7848	Elliot	Yeah, I thought I was gonna be cool in high school for like five minutes, but then my dad made me play the tuba in the marching band and I developed massive forearms. Halfway through the prom, my silk gloves exploded off me like I was the Incredible Hulk.
7849	Dan	You know I think it's sexy to dance with a woman who can lift her partner over her head.
7850	J.D.'s Thoughts	You know, it's nice when your friends and family click. It makes you feel likeWait a second, is she still laughing?
7851	Dan	That is
7852	J.D.	Stop your stupid laughing! It makes you look like a whore!Jokin'! Heh.

7854	Lady	I appreciate everything you did for my husband. The funeral's tomorrow, and I'd love it if you could attend.
7855	Turk	Unfortunately I'm in surgery all day. But, still, I'm sorry for your loss.
7856	Dr. Cox	Dodging the funeral? Nice!
7857	Turk	'Scuse me?
7858	Dr. Cox	Just a veteran move from the baby-faced sophomore. The whole "I'm sorry for your loss" thing was a little Hallmark-y for me, but darn it all if you're not showing just a ton of promise!
7859	Turk	If I could be there, I'd be there. Wait a second, you treated him, right? So you should want to go, too. Right?
7860	Dr. Cox	Hey, Ghandi. For your information, I attended that poor vegetable's funeral every single time I set foot in his room over the last six weeks. Thank God the family finally moved him over to Surgery, where you guys were good enough to help him kick that nasty oxygen habit he had once and for all.
7861	Turk	Oh, that's great make jokes. You know, I wish I could be an insensitive, cynical robo-doc like you, but unfortunately, I don't hate the world enough. You know what I'm saying, chief?
7862	Dr. Cox	Will people please stop calling me "chief"!
7863	Dr. Kelso	Hey, numb-nuts.
7864	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
7865	J.D.	Hey, Dan! You remember when we were kids, and every Halloween you used to always try and scare the crap out of me?
7866	Dan	Yeah, I remember that.So, while I'm here, we should play some frisbee golf, we should...maybe give dad a call.... Dad. Oh, we should definitely make sure I sleep with that Elliot chick.
7867	J.D.	That's a little weird for me 'cause...I don't know if you'd know this or not, but...we used to be intimate.
7868	Dan	Int inimate? What'd you do, bathe her?
7869	J.D.	Yeah, once...but she was wearing a swimsuit.
7870	Dan	All right, I get it. I'll back off. It's gonna be tough, though, 'cause she sounds kinda wild.Can't teach it.
7871	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
7872	Dr. Cox	Come on, let's go, you've got an opposable thumb you can use it!God, I hate Halloween!
7873	Carla	Somebody needs to adjust their attitude if they want some candy.
7874	Dr. Cox	You mean the popcorn balls and the deformed lollipos? I mean, honestly, where do you get this crap anyway?
7875	Nurse Roberts	I made it! If you want name-brand candy, my fist is packed with peanuts!
7876	Dr. Cox	Of course it is.
7877	Carla	Oh, what's the matter, did Raggedy Ann scare you?
7878	Dr. Cox	What are you, a rat?
7879	Turk	Don't listen to him, Baby.
7880	Carla	I never do.
7881	Turk	So, Dr. Cox, the intern asked for a surgical consult on Mr. Carney?
7882	Dr. Cox	Yeah.
7883	Turk	I suggest we do a fem-pop bypass.
7884	Dr. Cox	Mr. Carney's a frail old man who'd...probably snap in half from a light sponge bath.
7885	Turk	All I'm saying is if we do surgery, we could improve his quality of life.
7886	Dr. Cox	The guy's a thousand. What's he gonna, take a steamer over to Europe, open up a café, and finally meet that nine hundred-year-old girl of his dreams?
7887	Turk	I made my recommendation.
7888	Dr. Cox	You stood up for what you believe in, and I respect that.
7889	Turk	Thank you.
7890	Dr. Cox	Twenty bucks says you kill him.
7891	Turk	You're on!
7892	Dr. Cox	You got it, baby.Whoa. Can I get some, uh, sugar over here?

7894	Dr. Kelso	Finally, can anyone tell me the dermatologic condition associated with rhinophyma...Dr. Murphy?
7895	Doug	Uh, could it be...psoriasis?
7896	Dr. Kelso	And yet further proof that the clown costume is redundant.Now if any of you other would-be revelers get the urge to dress up on this, the mother of all non-holidays, please consider me the razor blade in your caramel apple. We're professionals, dammit!You know...it's nothing personal, son...you just make me sick.
7897	Doug	He called me son! He called me son!
7898	J.D.	Score.
7899	Doug	Boo-yeah!
7900	Elliot	So, uh, you going to lunch with your brother?
7901	J.D.	Yeah, I...well, you know, I would've invited you, but I already made the reservation for two.
7902	Elliot	So call and change it to three.
7903	J.D.	Ohh, I'm not gonna mess with that hostess. You know, she uses sharp tones.
7904	Elliot	Heh, yeah right. Now, I'll give you three seconds to give me the real reason I can't go to lunch, otherwise I'm coming.Three...two...one.
7905	J.D.	Because I need special time with my brother! Argh!
7906	Janitor	Trick.
7907	J.D.	Excuse me?
7908	Janitor	I just figure you gotta be wondering, "Am I gonna get a trick, or am I gonna get a treat?" You'll be getting a trick.
7909	J.D.	Whatever.
7910	Janitor	It'll be fast, and you won't even know it's me.
7911	J.D.	You just told me it was gonna be you.
7912	Janitor	You'll still have your doubts.And the best part is, you're gonna be nervous all day about it, 'cause it could happen at any time!That wasn't it. Fun, though!
7913	J.D.	False alarm, boys.
7914	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
7915	Turk	All right, here we go, Mr. Carney.Dr. Wen, I want you to stay focused, okay? I want Dr. Wen to be Dr. _Zen_, man!
7916	Dr. Wen	Christopher, after fifteen years and over ten thousand surgeries, I think I can do without the pep-talk.
7917	Turk	Message received, sir. I believe in you.

7919	J.D.'s Thoughts	So, big deal, we're having lunch together. It doesn't have to be awkward.
7920	Dan	So, what's my little bro like in the sack?
7921	Elliot	What?!
7922	J.D.	You do not have to answer that.
7923	Dan	'Kay, if he tries hard but there's room for improvement, take a sip of your drink.
7924	J.D.	Hey!
7925	Elliot	What? I was thirsty.
7926	J.D.	All right, you know, fine. A-ask me if she could be better!What? Thirsty!

7929	Turk	Stable. Condition. What time is it? Time to dance!Come on! Wit' it! Come on! Bring it back! Come on! Heeeheee! Woo! Pay the man!
7930	Dr. Cox	There you go.
7931	Turk	Hello, Mr. Jackson! I want to introduce you to the Washington brothers. Y'all get nice and cozy...up in my wallet!
7932	Dr. Cox	Now, before you get too awful high up on your horse, there, Tonto, I feel it's my duty to remind you of just a little something.
7933	Turk	Mm? Hm?
7934	Dr. Cox	See, you just made a twenty dollar bet on whether a fellow human being would live or die. Now tell me, just exactly how does that make you feel, Mr. Sensitive? Pretty good?All the best.
7935	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
7936	Elliot	So, uh, why'd you drive someone else's car across country?
7937	Dan	It is a great way to make three hundred bucks.
7938	Elliot	What do you do that you could take that kind of time off?
7939	Dan	I tend bar.
7940	J.D.	But not just like any bar it's like "_The_ Bar". It's like, when all the college kids come home from Thanksgiving, it's like where everybody goes. I go there when I'm home.
7941	Elliot	So you still live in your home town?
7942	Dan	Yeah, I kinda take care of my mom's place, so she lets me stay with her.
7943	J.D.	Well, Dan, you don't _stay with her_. I mean, come on, it it it he's not like Greg Brady living in the attic with beads for a door. I mean...he totally has his own space. More like...uh, Kirk Cameron in the last season of 'Growing Pains', when he lived above the garage with Boner? Anyone? Am I the only one? Boner? ...No?
7944	J.D.'s Narration	And that's when I realized that even though I was a little jealous, that's not why I was trying to keep Elliot and Dan apart.
7945	J.D.	Dan's doing great.
7946	J.D.'s Narration	...The real reason was that I was ashamed of my brother. And I think he knew it, too.
7947	Dan	You two should probably get back to work.

7949	Elliot	These heated seats are amazing. They make my butt tingle.
7950	Dan	And every time you say that, an angel gets their wings.No, it's a sweet ride, but as J.D. has made so abundantly clear, I I could never afford this car.
7951	J.D.	Would you please just let it go!?
7952	Elliot	Um...so I'll...I'll see ya.
7953	Dan	Not if I see you first.
7954	J.D.'s Narration	Somehow I knew my brother would handle this the way he always did when there was a deep emotional conflict between us.
7955	Dan	So, can you work the windows from back there?
7956	J.D.	No...why?Oh, God! Oh, please tell me that......that was the horn!

7960	Dr. Kelso	Do you people have any idea how long I've been waiting on you? Next time, if you're not here in thirty minutes or less, I expect a free dead body! ...Or at least some garlic knots.
7961	Turk	Dr. Kelso, I think that's extremely insensitive.
7962	Dr. Kelso	I don't think so. Miss Parker, you care to weigh in?Nope, she's fine with it. And she knows a thing or two! ...Except of course that a yellow light means to slow down.
7963	Turk	You're not understanding what I'm trying to tell you.Kitty, this sucks.
7964	Carla	How can I make it better?

7969	J.D.	Yeah...why wouldn't I be?
7970	Elliot	You and your brother? I mean, come on, the tension on the ride back to work was palpable. I wanted to say something. I mean, I was this close to getting back in the car.

7975	Turk	Oh, please, it's the least I could do for...uh....
7976	Mother	You see, he doesn't even remember his name!
7977	Turk	No! No, no, no, I remember his name.... His his name was...His name was...was...was...uh.... You know, we used to call him "old chicken neck".
7978	Lady	This is the problem with doctors today they don't care!
7979	Turk	No, no! It's just that, uh, recently I've had a lot of patients, and so it I've gotten I've been really busy!
7980	Lady	Not too busy to come here in the middle of the day and stuff your face with free food!
7981	Turk	Damn you, woman!
7982	Carla	Ladies, please! This is a good, caring doctor. He did everything he could for Bob.
7983	Lady	Right!
7984	Mother	Hah!
7985	Turk	This is "Bob"? That's "Bob"?!

7988	J.D.	Oh, I get it. Well, let's see how tough you are without your costume on. Go ahead and and knock the folders out of my hand now!
7989	Janitor	What costume?
7990	J.D.	You weren't wearing a gorilla suit before?
7991	Janitor	There's someone running around in a gorilla suit? What's he look like?
7992	J.D.	A gorilla....
7993	Janitor	No, it's not me.
7994	J.D.	Well, then, why'd you knock the folder out of my hand?!
7995	Janitor	Because you asked me to. Here you go.
7996	J.D.	I didn't ask you to do that!
7997	Janitor	Yeah...that comes free with the folder knock.
7998	Dr. Kelso	Hey, sport, how you doin'?
7999	J.D.	Oh, good, sir.
8000	Dr. Kelso	I don't have time to stand here and flirt, son. There have been rumblings that you let your brother play doctor the other day.
8001	J.D.	Dr. Kelso, I
8002	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Dorian, if I had one shred of evidence that incident actually took place, you would be working with my nephew Francis so fast, it'd make your head spin!
8003	J.D.	Sir, I don't follow.
8004	Dr. Kelso	He cleans pools! I forgot you didn't know that! Well, anyway, I trust we will not be seeing your brother in the hospital again!

8007	Turk	Oh, my God...I'm totally going to hell.
8008	Carla	Turk, wait! People get thrown out of funerals every day!Why are you laughing?
8009	Dr. Cox	Well, top of my head, I'd have to say it's because he's suffering. But, of course, I love the poetry of someone putting himself way up on a pedestal and then getting knocked the hell back down into this puddle of self-hated...with the rest of us.
8010	Carla	Did you do this to him?
8011	Dr. Cox	I don't know. Did anybody ever really _do_ anything to anybody else?
8012	Carla	You're gonna tell me why you did this and it better be good.
8013	Dr. Cox	How does "for poops and giggles" grab ya?
8014	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8015	Elliot	Isn't there...something you guys wanna talk about? You know, like cars or sports...or boobs?
8016	Dan	I'll talk about boobs. Remember Fred Kiefer's mom?
8017	J.D.	She wore a tank-top to Fred's thirteenth birthday party.... She taught us how to bob for apples, and three guys passed out.
8018	Elliot	Okay, great story! Now how about something with a little more substance?
8019	Dan	Dude, remember the cans on Pat Clark's mom?
8020	J.D.	Yeah! Those were awesome!
8021	Elliot	'Kay, you know what, forget it.
8022	J.D.	Elliot! Come on! What does she expect us to talk about?
8023	Dan	I don't know.... Maybe the fact that you're so embarrassed by me that you make excuses to your friends about how I live my life.
8024	J.D.	Oh, yeah....
8025	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8026	J.D.	We're...we're working hard on a cure.
8027	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8028	Dr. Cox	Let's go, field trip.
8029	Turk	I got things to do, you know.
8030	Dr. Cox	Let me guess, you're off to another funeral. I'll make you a deal you come with me right now, and if you're still late for the graveyard, I will personally scour the obituaries with you this weekend and you can just go nuts!
8031	Turk	Carla put you up to this?
8032	Dr. Cox	No, it was my idea. I desperately want to be close with you, I just can't figure out how to connect. Turn around.Turn around.You see Dr. Wen in there? He's explaining to that family that something went wrong and that the patient died. He's gonna tell them what happened, he's gonna say he's sorry, and then he's going back to work. You think anybody else in that room is going back to work today?Oh, and by the way.... "Bob"? Who doesn't get that?
8033	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8034	Dan	Look, J.D., we're all proud you became a doctor, but just because I haven't achieved as much as you doesn't mean I don't like what I do.
8035	J.D.	Dan, there's nothing wrong with being a bartender.
8036	Dan	I like living with mom.
8037	J.D.	She makes great eggs!
8038	Dan	All in all, I'm pretty damn happy! I'm happy...you know?
8039	J.D.'s Thoughts	And now for the apology.
8040	J.D.	That's a load of crap.Look, I know you, okay. I know the reason you wanted to pretend you're a doctor yesterday is 'cause you hate working in that bar and you wanted to feel like somebody for once. Come on, man, you're not you're not driving that car across the country for the three hundred dollars you're doing it 'cause you like the way you feel when you drive it. And the funny thing is, you could be that guy, but you're afraid that if if you actually have to try at something you might fail, and that's just not a chance you're willing to take.
8041	Dan	What can I say? It's been a real pleasure seeing you.
8042	J.D.	Dan....
8043	J.D.'s Narration	Right then, I knew I'd never see my brother the same way again.You can never let go of the kid inside of you.
8044	Turk	Dude, that girl in the wolf outfit is totally checking you out!
8045	J.D.	I'd let her to blow my house down, you know what I'm sayin'!
8046	Turk	...a cashew!
8047	J.D.'s Narration	You see, it's the kid inside of us that keeps us all from going crazy.
8048	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8049	J.D.'s Narration	As a doctor, you learn to use anything you can to keep a patient from getting hurt again.
8050	J.D.	So, Mike, before we get you out of here, I think it's important we go over this one more time, okay?
8051	J.D.'s Narration	...Even their own home video.
8052	J.D.	See, right about here is where you get hurt.Aw-ha-ha!See here, you're not hurt, and then Oh! Good God! Hurt again!Not hurt.... Hurt!Baritone.... Soprano!Married with two kids.... Dying old
8053	Mike	Look, I-I get it, okay.
8054	J.D.	Okay; okay, Mike, that's all that matters.Victor.... Ohhhhh....Victoria!I mean, the kid thinks he's Evil Knievel
8055	Dr. Cox	Oh, gosh, Martha, I'd love to attend your safety camp this summer I would but here my parents are making me go to Maine with them. So whatta you say you make sure and take a lot of pictures, that way, when you get back, we can both sit down and put together a "Friends Forever" collage. Come on, now, the kid's sixteen years old he's a little busted up, it's not that big a deal. I mean, hell, when...when you were a kid, you must've cut your hand on your doll house?
8056	J.D.	Oh, please. I lived for danger.
8057	Little J.D.	Who's ready for some frisbee!Get my mom! Get my mom!
8058	J.D.	I had...four different helmets.
8059	Dr. Cox	Lookit, I don't have time right now to be the hundred-watt bulb for your annoying little moth, so if you could just fly away, that'd be great. Just fly awa hey....?
8060	J.D.'s Narration	I usually don't walk away from Dr. Cox, but today's the day the pharmaceutical reps show up to peddle their new drugs. And, at Sacred Heart, that means one thing: Julie's here.
8061	J.D.	Damn.
8062	Turk	Da-amn!
8063	Carla	Damn...What? She's hot.
8064	J.D.	No, _that's_ hot.
8065	Turk	Baby, you know that fantasy I have of you, me, and a player to be named later...?
8066	Carla	Yeah, fine. If it was someone like her, I'd go for it.
8067	Turk	You are the best thing that has _ever_ happened to me.
8068	Elliot	I can't believe that you said that!
8069	Carla	Oh, what? It's not like he's actually gonna do anything about it.
8070	Julie	Oh!
8071	Turk	Hey, Baby!
8072	J.D.	Yeah...you can't ever give a guy that window.
8073	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8074	J.D.'s Narration	Even though she was way out of my league, I decided to show some guts and lay down the smoothest rap I knew.
8075	J.D.	...Hey....
8076	Julie	Hi, handsome! I'm Julie.
8077	J.D.	Ohh? Were you named after a precious jewel...ie?
8078	Julie	You're cute! Would you like a pen?
8079	J.D.	No.... I'd _love_ one.
8080	Julie	Well, go ahead, take it.
8081	J.D.'s Thoughts	Steady.... Easy, now.... You're almost...there!
8082	J.D.	But I
8083	Dr. Cox	That's a _bad_ Newbie!My _God_, you'd be more subtle if you stood naked in the hallway, eating a 10-inch kielbasa.
8084	Julie	That hurts, Perry!
8085	Dr. Cox	Let's go.
8086	Julie	Well, I gotta say, I don't mind watching you two boys walk away! Oh, yeah, work it! Ow!
8087	J.D.	She's talking about our tushies. I say we go back, but let's walk backwards!
8088	Dr. Cox	There is no one I hate more than that Medusa she is everything that's wrong with medicine. And even knowing that she's in the hospital makes me want to tear someone's head off.
8089	Elliot	Dr. Cox! Is this a g-good time? Because I just have a teeny, teeny-weeny little question about Mrs. Kahn's
8090	Dr. Cox	Oh, for you, Barbie: anything!
8091	Elliot	Super!
8092	Dr. Cox	But first, an interesting side note: I actually had my physical last week, and while my cholesterol was low, my blood pressure was through the roof. Needless to say, my physician was stumped; but now thank God! you've helped us solve that riddle. You see, because, the very instant I heard your shrill voice whining about a teeny-weeny problem, aw, it took every ounce of self-restraint I had to keep blood from shooting out my ears.
8093	Elliot	Doesn't it seem like, in the time it took to say all that, you could've just helped me out instead?
8094	Dr. Cox	Well, yes it does. But, here, that's what makes it delicious.
8095	J.D.	What? I am not gonna say a word.
8096	Elliot	You just did.
8097	J.D.	Except that. And...that. And now that. And that and that and that. It just keeps on going!
8098	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8099	Turk	Hey, cutie! What's your name?
8100	Carla	I'm Carla, I'm your girlfriend, and as much as I usually love it, I really don't have time to play that game where we pretend we never met, okay?
8101	Turk	Carla's a pretty name.
8102	Carla	You know I'd play, Sweetie; you know I'd play. But, because I'm "just a nurse", I have to go get Dr. Wilder's permission to give his patient some food even though I know it's perfectly fine.
8103	Todd	Speaking of things that are perfectly fine....
8104	Carla	Eugh.
8105	Todd	That was a compliment! Why won't any women talk to me?
8106	Nurse	Because you're slimy. And you turn everything into a double entendre.
8107	Todd	Not true!
8108	Turk	Go ahead.
8109	Todd	I'd like to double her entendre!Please?
8110	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8111	J.D.'s Thoughts	He's leaving! This is officially the greatest day ever!
8112	J.D.	Taking off?
8113	Janitor	Yeah. If that's okay?
8114	J.D.	That's fine.
8115	Janitor	You know, I just wanted to, uh, sneak out for an hour, and see my kid's fourth grade play. But, you caught me!
8116	J.D.	No. N-n-no no catchies.
8117	Janitor	No, no, no; I think you're right. From now on, before I do anything, I'll make sure to run it by you first. Permission to go see my kid's attempt to overcome his crippling shyness by appearing in his fourth grade class's production of "Town Without A Turkey"?
8118	J.D.	I gotta get back to work.
8119	Janitor	"Back to work..." Message received.
8120	J.D.'s Thoughts	What just happened!?!
8121	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8122	Elliot	I can't figure out what to do about Mrs. Kahn. I don't know if I should send her to surgery?
8123	J.D.	Well, don't send her to surgery. I'll tell you what you do: You wait and see. And I know I'm right, 'cause I'm a "wait and see" kind of guy. You know, Elliot, in modern medicine, we're faced with tough decisions almost every day
8124	Elliot	You are amazing!
8125	J.D.	Well, amazing is sort of a strong word.... I just show up and let the Lord work through me.
8126	Elliot	You actually think you're a better doctor than me, don't you?
8127	J.D.'s Thoughts	Well, I do have better bed-side manner.... I anticipate problems way ahead of time.... Oh, and my hair never gets in my face; so yes, yes I do!
8128	J.D.	No I don't.
8129	Elliot	Yes you do. Every time you stare off in to space like this.......I know you're just thinking of something you're too afraid to say.
8130	J.D.	Please, I never do this....
8131	J.D.'s Thoughts	Maybe she's just upset because she knows I'm right?
8132	Elliot	Oh, my God!
8133	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8134	J.D.	Dr. Cox, I hate to bring it up again, but it seems important.... Julie likes our tushies.
8135	Dr. Cox	Newbie, any doctor with even a shred of self-respect wouldn't give that woman the time of day.
8136	Dr. Kelso	Oh, Julie!
8137	Dr. Cox	Well, well. If it isn't the Captain and Tennille of the underworld.
8138	Julie	Hi, boys!
8139	J.D.	Hi, Julie!
8140	Dr. Kelso	Perry, do you know the name of the new anti-arrhythmic drug that Julie is selling?
8141	Dr. Cox	That's a tough one.
8142	J.D.	It's Plomox.
8143	Dr. Cox	Nice work, Nancy Drew. Now, see if you can solve the one about the missing ID badge.
8144	Julie	Plomox is the most effective anti-arrhythmic drug on the market right now. And it has minimal side-effects: Only nausea, impotence, and anal leakage.
8145	Dr. Cox	I'm getting two out of three just from the conversation.
8146	Dr. Kelso	You kids can talk more about it tonight over the pharmaceutical dinner that you're going to help her put together.
8147	Dr. Cox	Don't do this to me, Bob!
8148	Julie	Do it to him, Bob!
8149	Dr. Kelso	And Perry, we're going to need a big staff turn-out, so don't take "no" for an answer!
8150	Dr. Cox	You going, there, Chief?
8151	Dr. Kelso	No! If I wanted to make boring small talk over low-grade beef, I'd have dinner at home.
8152	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8153	Carla	I'm just increasing your Lidocaine drip just a little bit, okay, Mr. Brooks?
8154	Turk	Hey, uh, Carla? You got a second?
8155	Carla	No, actually I'm swamped.
8156	Turk	I got a present for you...!
8157	Carla	Why would you get me a present?
8158	Turk	Why does it need to be a birthday or an anniversary for me to get my baby a little somesing-somesing.
8159	Carla	Ahhh. Plus, you figure you'd get yourself a little at work "somesing-somesing."
8160	Turk	I'll get the door!
8161	Carla	Wow! A bus pass! Help me get off my bra.
8162	Turk	That's not all! You'll use that bus pass for an all expense paid trip to...Nurse Practitioner School! Where you'll learn how to be more than "just a nurse"!
8163	Carla	"Just" a nurse?
8164	Turk	Did I say "just a nurse"? I meant "a nurse"! Honey, you were complaining about having to ask Dr. Wilder for permission just to feed a patient. And this way, you'll have more responsibility, plus you'll make more money; so, I thought that
8165	Carla	You thought that the only reason I've been doing my job for the last eight years is because someone didn't come along to hand me a brochure?
8166	Turk	And a bus pass?
8167	Carla	You're unbelievable.
8168	Turk	Damn!
8169	Todd	Dude! I am just as disappointed as you are.
8170	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8171	Elliot	J.D., look, even though I decided to send Mrs. Kahn to surgery, I know that you were just trying to help me in your own...sucky way. And...I over-reacted, and that's something I've been working on in therapy to not do as much.
8172	J.D.	But, I still think you should have gone with my "wait and see" approach.
8173	Elliot	Well, you're not the boss of me!!!
8174	J.D.	I'm not the boss of anyone around here.
8175	Janitor	Permission to use the can, Boss.
8176	J.D.	Enough, already! I'm not doing this.Fine! Permission granted!
8177	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8178	Dr. Kelso	So, Mr. Brooks is doing peachy, huh?
8179	Carla	Peachy-keen.
8180	Dr. Kelso	Great. Great! A patient's improvement is always cause for celebration here at Sacred Heart. And yet, for some reason, I'm not wearing a party hat, sitting bare-ass on the hospital's copier machine.You know why? It's not because I have the name Johnny tattooed on my butt he's an old sailor buddy, and if you went through what we did, you'd understand. It's because somebody went ahead and increased Mr. Brooks' Lidocaine drip, and by law that could only be a doctor. Are _you_ a doctor, Nurse Espinosa?Well?
8181	Carla	No, sir.
8182	Dr. Kelso	You're damn right, you're not.
8183	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8184	Julie	So, how's the guest list for tonight's steak dinner shaping up?
8185	Dr. Cox	Well, now, I don't have any definitive confirmations yet, but, admittedly, that could be because I haven't asked anyone.
8186	Julie	Why does it have to be like this every time I come here? I mean, what is your problem with me?
8187	Dr. Cox	Okay. Well, for starters, everyone here knows that you sell pills, and yet you use phrases like "take orally" and "increases blood flow" way, _way_ too much. I mean, jeepers, Julie, don't you understand you got half the doctors on this staff believing that if they go ahead and join team Plomox, that they got an outside shot of you showing them the cotton inside your bottle?Would you like to know the real dirty, dirty little secret?It's that your drug is so damn good that you guys went ahead and put a six-hundred percent mark-up on it. But, hey, the only ones who get hurt are the sick people, right? And since your company damn-sure doesn't care about them, and you're part of the system, that just means you don't care, either. And that's...pretty much what's making me sick; that's all.
8188	Julie	Well, you can say what you want, Perry. But we both know that you'd love nothing more than to smack this fine ass.Ooh!
8189	Dr. Cox	Oh!
8190	Julie	Perry?Harder, Perry! Ooh! Don't stop, Perry! Ow! Perry. That feels goo-ooh-ooh-ood!
8191	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8192	J.D.	All right, so you promise me you're gonna be more careful, right?
8193	Mike	Look, dude, the only way to feel alive is to push the limits once in a while. You know?
8194	J.D.	Well.... Keep it real!
8195	Mike	Oh, God.See ya, geek!
8196	J.D.	Buy a cup!Hey. What's wrong?
8197	Elliot	Mrs. Kahn died on the operating table.
8198	J.D.'s Narration	There are a lot of things that can take you by surprise.Sometimes, it's just realizing that you're not as happy as you thought.Sometimes, it's a hot chick smacking her tushie.And sometimes, it's when you take a chance...and lose.
8199	Elliot	This just sucks.... You know?
8200	J.D.'s Thoughts	This is a crucial moment. Pick your words carefully.
8201	J.D.	I guess I was right after all.Stupid!
8202	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8203	J.D.'s Narration	I had to talk to Elliot before she went in to the Morbidity and Mortality Conference; 'cause nothing puts you in a worse mood than having to explain why your patient died.
8204	J.D.'s Thoughts	I just need an opportunity to talk to her when there's no possible way that she can interrupt me.Peanut-butter cracker! Go, go, go!
8205	J.D.	Elliot! Hey! What I said earlier came out completely the wrong way; I just want you to know that I-I
8206	Elliot	Bite me!
8207	J.D.	She's a crafty lass.
8208	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8209	Turk	Baby, I know you had a rough day, and I know I was part of it, so I thought I'd make it up to you by taking you out to a nice dinner.
8210	Todd	Which one of these waitresses you think will do me?
8211	Dr. Cox	I'd say you got an outside shot with the bus-boy over there.
8212	Carla	You realize this doesn't count, right?
8213	Turk	Yeah, but, Baby: Free steak!
8214	Dr. Cox	You just flat-out get women, don't you.
8215	Turk	Baby, this is kind of romantic, right?
8216	Todd	Check it out: It's a meat cookie!
8217	Carla	Ugh-guh.
8218	Julie	Hello, boys and girl! So, how's the food?
8219	Todd	Mmm.
8220	Turk	Free!
8221	Julie	And how are you, Dr. Cox?
8222	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8223	Dr. Cox	Look, I'm just here to enjoy my meal, so unless those things dispense A-1 sauce, I'd keep movin'.
8224	Julie	That is so, so funny! You know what else is funny? How you claim you want nothing to do with me, yet, every time I turn around, there you are. Hm! I wonder why that is?Ooh! That feels good!
8225	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8226	Dr. Kelso	Finally we have, um, Dr. Reid's necrotizing fasciitis case. Deceased.Oh, don't be frightened, Sweetheart, no one's on trial, here at least not until the family sues your little behind.Sweetie, I'm not joking. But, should that happen, you may rest assured that the hospital will stand behind you one-hundred percent.
8227	Elliot	Thank you very much, sir.
8228	Dr. Kelso	Now, see, there I _was_ joking. Try to keep up.
8229	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, God, this is painful. It's like watching a shark circle a baby harp seal.
8230	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Reid faced a very difficult decision. And she chose an extremely risky course.
8231	J.D.'s Thoughts	He's like a royal python torturing a hopper mouse. ...Man, I love Animal Planet.
8232	Kelso	I believe we all have a lesson to learn from Dr. Reid's case....
8233	J.D.'s Thoughts	And here comes the crushing blow!
8234	Dr. Kelso	...I say, kudos to Dr. Reid.
8235	J.D.	Whattos to who?
8236	Student	Shhh.
8237	Dr. Kelso	...Without surgery, her patient didn't have a popsicle's chance in hell. By making the tough choice, she at least gave Mrs. Kahn an honest shot.And now, for all of you "wait and see" doctors out there.......If you do not get to the point where you have the courage to take risks, you will _never_ be a great doctor.
8238	J.D.	Never?
8239	Dr. Kelso	Never _ever_.
8240	Carla	Turk, don't eat off my plate!
8241	Turk	You're right, Baby, I'm sorry; that's rude.
8242	Carla	So, you're having steak with a side of steak?
8243	Turk	That's right turf and turf.
8244	Carla	You know what? I'm on my second glass of good wine, I'm watching my boyfriend try to eat his body-weight in meat, and I am extremely tickled that the only thing Dr. Cox wants isn't on the menu. Ha!
8245	Dr. Cox	What?
8246	Carla	Oh, what can I say? I'm finally having a good time.
8247	Dr. Cox	That'll pass.
8248	Todd	I still think it's pretty lame that you didn't like Turk's nurse practitioner present.
8249	Turk	Dude.
8250	Dr. Cox	Told ya.
8251	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8252	J.D.	Hey, Elliot, I'm...I'm sorry that I was such a jerk before. But, hey, I got mine...right? Anyway, thanks for being classier than I am and not rubbing it in my face.
8253	Elliot	No problem. Hey.... You never told me that you're part Native American.
8254	J.D.	What are you talking about?
8255	Elliot	Aren't you a member of the Waitansee tribe?Oh, come on! I I laughed so hard when I thought of that that I peed a little!I changed right after.
8256	Todd	Well, seriously, why wouldn't you want a better job?
8257	Turk	Hold up. My Baby's happy with being just a nurse. Did I say "Just a nurse"? I didn't mean "just a nur ". Nobody at this table said "just ". I meant: "A Nurse." Right, Baby?
8258	Carla	That's right!
8259	Todd	Why?
8260	Dr. Cox	Oh, just not smart. Even for you.
8261	Carla	Excuse _me_ for not having all your male ambition. I can't believe anyone would look down on me because I'm good at what I do, and because I love doing it!
8262	Turk	I'm sick to my stomach.
8263	Carla	Me too, Turk! Me too!
8264	Turk	No, Baby, I'm serious; I think I'm in trouble here.
8265	Carla	Baby?
8266	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8267	Janitor	Permission to speak, sir?
8268	J.D.	You know what no. No, you may not speak not now, and not ever, okay? You have overplayed your hand and you may never talk to me again. Those are the rules of the game.
8269	Janitor	Then I quit.
8270	J.D.	No, no, no, no! No quitsies! Check-mate, Gin, and Yahtzee, my friend.
8271	Janitor	You know, my son used to love to play Yahtzee with me, until you made me skip his play. Now he won't eat!
8272	J.D.	We've started a new game now, haven't we.
8273	Janitor	Yeah. It's called, You don't eat...until Timmy does.

8277	Dr. Cox	Actually, it's a family business.
8278	Julie	So, here we are. Two people...street lamp...full moon....
8279	Dr. Cox	...Guy pissin' on the dumpster. Oh! Did I break the mood?
8280	Julie	Fine. Want me to drop the flirty crap? I'm interested in you. I think we're a lot alike, I think we have chemistry...and I think you're scared, so you use what I do as an excuse not to give us a try.
8281	Dr. Cox	Sorry, I gotta go.You okay?
8282	Julie	Look at that I bounced back!
8283	Turk	Baby, my stomach's gonna explode!
8284	Carla	It's only heartburn, Sweetie, you'll be fine.
8285	Dr. Cox	Hey.
8286	Carla	Hey.
8287	Dr. Cox	How's, uh, how's MeatHead?
8288	Carla	I know I'm not a doctor, but if you could order a strong antiemetic, that would be great.
8289	Dr. Cox	For the record, you know you would ace that nurse practitioners program.
8290	Carla	Really? You think so? Well, what if the classes are too hard? What if the teachers are mean? What if the other kids don't like me?
8291	Dr. Cox	Okay.
8292	Carla	Of course I would ace that program! But I barely get to see my boyfriend as it is. And if I went to class five nights a week? Well.... I guess I'm taking my chances on Turk right now.
8293	Dr. Cox	Him?
8294	Turk	Somebody make it stop!
8295	Carla	I just don't want to look back and wonder what could have been, you know?
8296	Dr. Cox	Yeah.
8297	Carla	Thanks.
8298	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8299	Elliot	Hey. How's it going?
8300	J.D.	You have more jokes, don't you?
8301	Elliot	I jotted a couple of things down!
8302	J.D.	Mm. You see that nurse over there? I love her. Every night at 10:30 for the last year, I've watched her come in here and get a cup of coffee. And not once have I had the courage to even ask her her name.
8303	Elliot	Well, if it makes you feel any better, she has a snaggletooth.
8304	J.D.	The point is, Kelso's right; you know? It's not even just professionally in my personal life, I don't take any chances, either. I want to, I just...I can never seem to take that first step.
8305	Elliot	Come here!
8306	J.D.	What?
8307	Elliot	Come on!
8308	J.D.	Where are we going? I don't I don't want to go anywhere. I want to spend time with Snaggletooth!
8309	Elliot	Nooo.
8310	J.D.'s Narration	I guess it all comes down to what we're willing to risk.For some of us, it's our feelings....
8311	Julie	Wanna talk?
8312	Dr. Cox	No.
8313	J.D.'s Narration	For others, it's our future....
8314	Turk	Baby?
8315	Carla	Hm?
8316	Turk	If I had to do it again, I would. 'Cause I love steak.
8317	Carla	I know, Buppy. I know.
8318	J.D.'s Narration	For me, it was taking a risk, period. Even if that meant starting with my very first step.
8319	Mike	Dude, you're gonna love this!
8320	J.D.	I don't wanna do it.
8321	Elliot	Come on, what's the worst that could happen?
8322	J.D.	We could die!
8323	Elliot	Okay, the second worst?
8324	J.D.	Can't we just go back and talk to Snaggletooth?!
8325	Elliot	No! Here we go!
8326	Together	ONE! TWO! THREE!
8327	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8328	J.D.'s Narration	As a doctor, you spend about a third of your nights sleeping at the hospital. But, truth be told, not a lot of sleeping actually takes place.
8329	Nurse Roberts	Dr. Reid?
8330	Elliot	I'm not sucking my thumb!
8331	Nurse Roberts	Mr. Rodriguez is coding.
8332	Elliot	Ohh.
8333	Nurse Roberts	You look pretty!
8334	Elliot	Oh, thank you!
8335	J.D.'s Narration	You learn to appreciate the little things like waking up in your own bed.Of course, if there's someone there with you....
8336	Julie	Sorry I woke you.
8337	Dr. Cox	I'll live.
8338	J.D.'s Narration	....that's just gravy.Yep, there's nothing like mornings at home!
8339	Carla	Hey, there, Sunshine!
8340	J.D.	Morning.
8341	J.D.'s Narration	I forgot Carla is staying with us while her building is being fumigated.
8342	Turk	Hey! Don't use Rowdy to cover up your giblets! Apologize!
8343	Carla	Hey, can somebody tell me why we have no milk or orange juice, but, like, forty fruit cups in here?
8344	J.D.'s Narration	The average resident owes over one hundred thousand dollars in med school loans, and makes about as much as a waiter. So you have to do things to make ends meet.Like, you can cover someone's shift.....Or you can steal stuff from the hospital.Or you can moonlight at an urgent care center.....Or, you can steal stuff.Or your dad can pay for everything.....Or, well...you know....
8345	Turk	Go, go! Run!
8346	Janitor	Hold up.
8347	J.D.	Why?
8348	Janitor	There's been several thefts around the hospital. We're doing bag checks.
8349	J.D.	Well, what about that guy taking scrubs?
8350	Janitor	Hey, Tom!
8351	Tom	Hey!
8352	Janitor	He doesn't have a bag.
8353	J.D.	Well, go ahead, narc. I'm clean.
8354	Janitor	Yeah? Ah-ha!
8355	J.D.'s Thoughts	Of course, if he was checking my trunk....
8356	J.D.	Pudding! Score!
8357	Turk	Come on! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!Get me a butterscotch, buddy! Come on!Ha-haaaaa!
8358	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8359	J.D.	So, I did that cardio-version, I extubated Mrs. Beyes, and I finished all the transfer summaries on the nursing home patients.
8360	Dr. Cox	Well, what can I say? You did exceptional work today, Newbie, and I'm proud of you.
8361	J.D.'s Thoughts	Did he just wink at me?
8362	Dr. Cox	There a problem?
8363	J.D.	I'm just so happy!No, no problem, sir.
8364	Dr. Cox	Thatta boy.And, Laverne, what is that delightfully naught-aye scent you're wearing?
8365	Nurse Roberts	It's called Twelve Hour Shift.
8366	Dr. Cox	Ow. Yeah, it is.
8367	Nurse Roberts	Why the hell is he so cheery?
8368	J.D.	Because I did exceptional work today.
8369	Dr. Cox	Hey, babe.
8370	Julie	Hey. I ordered the fight on pay-per-view, got a six-pack of your favorite beer, and we are leaving this second.
8371	Dr. Cox	Hop on, blondie. Come'ere.Oh, Perry gonna get some lovin'. Perry gonna get some lovin'. Oh, Perry gonna get some lovin'.
8372	Nurse Roberts	Mm-hmm.
8373	Dr. Kelso	Is there one bathroom in this damn place that has toilet paper? Or do I have to start carrying around a basket of leaves?!
8374	Turk	This is the reason why your headache didn't go away: That's actually pronounced analgesic, not anal-gesic. Sir, the pills go in your mouth.
8375	Doctor	You know, we're gonna be short another doctor tomorrow night, so if you've got a friend that wants to pick up extra three hundred bucks....?
8376	Turk	And they said they'll pay you two hundred bucks cash money.
8377	J.D.	Sweet! Dude, you are like the best friend ever!
8378	Turk	Hell, yeah!
8379	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8380	Carla	Uuuggh! My mother lives with me all year my aunt Marie has to take care of her for _one week_ and she won't stop bitching!
8381	Elliot	So? My dad's coming in to town for a conference tomorrow.
8382	Carla	You don't seem that stressed out.
8383	Elliot	Well, I haven't pooed in six days.
8384	J.D.	Twice this morning, and I haven't even had my coffee yet.
8385	Elliot	You really pick odd things to brag about.
8386	J.D.	I'm just saying, if I had to get three by lunch, I probably could.
8387	Carla	Hey, guys. Gyno Girls, twelve o'clock.
8388	J.D.'s Narration	Obstetrics and Gynecology is a specialty that's usually dominated by women.
8389	Dr. Gerson	Dr. Reid? I'm Dr. Gerson. We were just wondering if you have any thoughts about your specialty? Because we really think you're OB-GYN material.
8390	J.D.'s Narration	Being a Gyno Girl is a lot like being in a sorority.
8391	Elliot	J.D.! I can't go with Dr. Gerson because I have to help you...right?
8392	J.D.	Ah, just gimme a second, I'm figuring something out for a patient.
8393	Dr. Gerson	I'm glad we all finally experimented with each other...but I'll never do it again.
8394	J.D.	Dammit!
8395	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8396	Male Doctor	Julie!
8397	Julie	Hey, Rob! Good to see you! Hey, Dan!
8398	Dr. Cox	Oh, God! I just hate that every doctor you ever gave a drug sample to sniffs around you like a pathetic little puppy-dog.
8399	Julie	I never gave those guys anything! I _slept_ with them!
8400	Dr. Cox	Oh! Great....
8401	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8402	Elliot	Those Gyno Girls are really putting the pressure on. We must have looked at a hundred women's bajingos today! Bajingo, bajingo, bajingo! I mean, I can't even look at my own bajingo, you know?
8403	Carla	Is that because it looks so much like a vagina?
8404	Elliot	Carla! There's people! You know, forget it. I'm just gonna stand up to them and tell them that I'm not interested.
8405	Carla	I think you should.
8406	Elliot	Sir? Why...are you laughing?
8407	Dr. Kelso	Oh, who knows. It could be the funny face I made with my peas....But, gun to my head, I'd say I'm laughing at the notion that you could stand up to anybody.
8408	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8409	Turk	There we go.
8410	J.D.'s Narration	Moonlighting sucks. But Turk and I make do.
8411	Turk	Now, will a lollipop put a smile on your face?
8412	J.D.	How about if Dr. Turk sings "Jimmy Crack Corn"?How about if Dr. Turk sings "Jimmy Crack Corn" as Neil Diamond?
8413	Turk	Okay.
8414	J.D.	Hit it.
8415	Turk	"Jimmy crack corn, and I don't care / Jimmy crack corn..." hold this for me...."...and I don't care / "Jimmy crack corn, and I don't ca re-uh!"
8416	Doctor	Dr. Dorian. We could use you again tomorrow if you'd like to make another three hundred dollars?
8417	J.D.	_Three_ hundred?
8418	J.D.'s Thoughts	Luckily for Turk, revenge is a dish best served cold.... Not unlike this tapioca pudding.
8419	Janitor	You know, we're zeroing in on the guy that's been stealing stuff.
8420	J.D.	Oh? Well, that's good.
8421	Janitor	Yep. In fact, right now, I'm dusting for fingerprints.
8422	J.D.	Really?
8423	Janitor	Nah, I'm just dusting.
8424	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8425	J.D.	Hey, Dr. Cox. I finished those discharge dictations you wanted me to do, and I was able to get Mrs. Chesky on the transplant list.
8426	J.D.'s Thoughts	And here comes the wink.Okay, maybe I'll start it off.
8427	Dr. Cox	Oh, my God, Sabrina. You had better tell me that you just had laser eye surgery and they accidentally severed the muscle that enables you to hold that lid up, because you did not just wink at me!
8428	J.D.	I didn't mean anything by it; I...I wink at everybody.Oh, hey, Dr. Kelso!
8429	Dr. Kelso	Save it for the bath houses, sport.
8430	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, boy.
8431	Carla	Don't take your anger out on Bambi!
8432	Dr. Cox	I'm not angry. So, my girlfriend serviced most of the staff. I'm proud of her commitment to medicine.
8433	Carla	Please! What about all the women you've slept with? Your ex-wife, that med student, your ex-wife, the cute nurse from radiology, your ex-wife....
8434	Dr. Cox	Would you please get off my ex-wife?
8435	Carla	I will if you will.
8436	Dr. Cox	Well...dammit! Gosh, now I'm too proud of ya to be mad at you.
8437	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8438	Elliot	So, Dad, how are things at home?
8439	Dr. Reid	They're good...good. Your mom redid the bedroom again. I'm gonna keep mine the way it is.
8440	Elliot	Well, you don't want to be one of those couples that does everything together.
8441	Dr. Reid	Sorry.Hello?
8442	Elliot	I just wanted you to know, sir, that I faced up to those Gyno Girls with a very strong and clear "No thank you."
8443	Dr. Kelso	Yes. I heard about your note!
8444	Elliot	Th-th-th-the point is that I'm out.
8445	Dr. Reid	That was your mom. She said to say...something.
8446	Elliot	Oh.
8447	Dr. Reid	So, did Dr. Gerson ever contact you?
8448	Elliot	You told her to talk to me?
8449	Dr. Reid	She went to med school with a colleague at my hospital. Come on, I want to go see the department.
8450	Dr. Kelso	Paging Dr. Backbone to the Bajingo Ward!
8451	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8452	Turk	Hey, man. You wanna grab a couple of beers tonight?
8453	J.D.	Can't. I'm moonlighting at Urgent Care.
8454	Turk	That's funny, the lady didn't call me?
8455	J.D.	Well, maybe that's because I found out you stole a hundred dollars from me and I Marcia Brady'd your ass.
8456	Turk	What?
8457	J.D.	You know, when Marcia was working at the ice cream shop, and then she got Jan a job, and they liked Jan better, so they fired Marcia.
8458	Turk	Yeah, "Marcia Gets Creamed" Season Five, Episode Three. Don't _ever_ question me on The Bunch. Besides, there's no way they liked you better than me.
8459	J.D.	Then maybe it's because I told her that you smoke the ganja.
8460	Turk	What!? That that's not even true! You're a jackass!
8461	J.D.	Where're you going? Munchies?
8462	Dr. Cox	I so don't think so!
8463	Julie	Hey! I was watching that.
8464	Dr. Cox	I know, but it's my place, so it's house rules. Lookit, I-I feel like...I owe you an apology, here.
8465	Julie	Really? For what?
8466	Dr. Cox	Well, just for being so jealous and pissy lately. I mean, I guess I just kind of got hung up on the fact that you were with, you know, Dr. Jasper and...Dr. Michaels...Dr. Stone. Was it his ear hair? Is that what is so compelling about him? Nevermind. The point is that this relationship, right here, is about the present...and it's about the future; and I'm never gonna let anything from our past ever get in our way again. Deal?
8467	Julie	Deal.
8468	Dr. Cox	Come here.
8469	Jordan	Keys still work!
8470	Dr. Cox	Excellent.

8472	Dr. Cox	Jordan. Please tell me you ate a raccoon and it's slowly making its way through your digestive system.
8473	Jordan	Oh, don't worry, it's not your baby. Though not for lack of trying see, we have sex a lot.
8474	Julie	Who are you?
8475	Jordan	Who do you think I am?
8476	Julie	Well, you have keys to the apartment, so I'm gonna say...the maid.
8477	Jordan	Oh.
8478	Dr. Cox	Julie, this is my ex-wife, Jordan; Jordan, this is my girlfriend, Julie. Okay! That was a treat, wasn't it? Now, would you like me to call you a cab, or should I just whistle and have the flying monkeys bring the broom around?
8479	Jordan	Oh, no.... He called you his girlfriend. If I were you, I'd start gathering your tiny panties up, because...I think you're done.
8480	Julie	I'm already bored by you. Perry, I will be in the bedroom; come join me when Tubby leaves.
8481	Jordan	Ta.
8482	Dr. Cox	Oh, who did that to you?
8483	Jordan	Well, I was at this fabulous hotel in Greece chock-full of available, wealthy men scru
8484	Dr. Cox	So, it was the bellboy.
8485	Jordan	Er, busboy or poolboy...something-boy I don't know. Anyway, when I first found out, I was panicked; and then I thought, you know, I've kind of been drifting through life all these years and I need to look into my heart and see what really matters to me. Anyway, I decided to keep the stupid kid.
8486	Dr. Cox	You should cut out the middleman and just have a therapist deliver him. I mean, honestly, Jordan, why why are you telling me...this?
8487	Jordan	Oh! Because I've also decided that I want you back.
8488	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8489	Janitor	Yeah, we got him. And he's gonna pay.
8490	J.D.	They're actually arresting someone for stealing pudding and toilet paper?
8491	Janitor	No. They found twenty bottles of Vicodin in his backpack. Did you steal pudding and toilet paper?
8492	J.D.	What? No! I hate pudding, and I don't use toilet...paper.I have one of those French things that shoots water up your butt.
8493	Janitor	"Bidet."
8494	J.D.	Bidet to you, sir.
8495	Carla	I miss you.
8496	Turk	I miss you, too.
8497	Carla	I thought I was gonna get to see you last night.
8498	Turk	Yeah, I know, but I...freakin' caught a E.M.T. shift, and I was riding around in an ambulance all night.
8499	J.D.	That is so cool! Did they let you run the siren?
8500	Turk	I'm not talking to you. ....And, yes.
8501	J.D.	Oh, quit being such a baby.
8502	Turk	"Bab " You stole my job!
8503	J.D.	You stole my money!
8504	Turk	That was a _finder's fee_!
8505	J.D.	Oh, yeah? Well find this!
8506	Carla	You know, you're supposed to grab your crotch when you say that.

8509	Elliot	So, this is where we all hang out. It's neat, huh?
8510	Dr. Reid	It's a...hell hole.
8511	Elliot	Dad? Why are you so set on me being an OB-GYN?
8512	Dr. Reid	Look, Honey, your highest income potential as a female physician is in Obstetrics.
8513	Elliot	But...don't you think that, maybe it's time that you left those sort of things up to me?
8514	Dr. Reid	Well, since I paid for your college, your medical school, your car, and now your apartment and all your living expenses, I'd have to say no.Good God, someone vomited on my hot dog.
8515	Elliot	It's chili, Dad! Okay? And you know what? Even though I really appreciate everything that you've given me, it's my life! So stop complaining and enjoy your damn meal!Oh! Oh, my God! That's disgusting!

8535	Jordan	No.... I don't know! I'm just completely hormonal! I mean, you try going from out-of-control horny to clinically depressed six times a day.
8536	Dr. Cox	Oh, gimme a break, I can knock that out on the way to work. Hey, lady, I'm proud of what you're doing here.
8537	Jordan	Really?
8538	Dr. Cox	Yeah, really.
8539	Jordan	Thanks. Last chance: Do you want me or not?
8540	Dr. Cox	Oh, Jordan; I'm so sorry, but....

8548	J.D.	Carla, why won't Turk let this go?
8549	Carla	Sh Marie! She's only with you for one week!
8550	J.D.	Carla....
8551	Carla	Hold on a second.Bambi, I've got ten messages from my mother. My Aunt Marie won't stop calling me _about_ my mother. I still gotta run home and put out canned food for my cat, because apparently the dry stuff doesn't cut it anymore. Plus, Turk and I can't find five minutes to spend together, because I'm working doubles and he's moonlighting non-stop so we can scrape together enough money to send my mother to a decent retirement community. So, what, Bambi? What?!
8552	J.D.	We'll talk later.
8553	J.D.'s Narration	Carla said something that made me realize exactly what I had to do.
8554	Turk	That's it for me, man. I'ma get my stuff and get out of here.
8555	Staffer	Okay, man.
8556	Turk	What the hell are you doing in here?
8557	J.D.	She said "we."
8558	Turk	What?
8559	J.D.	Carla. She said "we" "We need to scrape some money together." And it wasn't just like a "we're dating" we; it was just like a "we're gonna spend the rest of our lives together" we. I don't know, man, that that just seems big to me, you know?
8560	Turk	Yeah, I know.
8561	J.D.	Can I run the siren?
8562	Turk	Yeah, but be quick.
8563	Carla	So, you finally stood up to your father?
8564	Elliot	Yep.
8565	Carla	And he cut you off no money, no nothing?
8566	Elliot	Pretty much.
8567	Carla	Jerk. Wow. This is a big place.
8568	Elliot	Do you know where I could find some boxes?
8569	Julie	So, is your ex-wife like all women are crazy-crazy? Or more like that assistant who tazered David Spade-crazy?
8570	Dr. Cox	Well, you gotta try and understand, she's going through a rough time right now, and I'm the one she's used to leaning on. Which, in her current condition, is actually causing me more physical pain than it is emotional. But, still, it sure was silly of her to try to make me choose between the two of you.
8571	Julie	I guess it was a pretty easy decision, huh?
8572	Dr. Cox	Well, when I really had a chance to think about it, it turns out it was the easiest decision I ever made.I was always gonna wind up with you.
8573	Jordan	So, the whole vulnerable crying thing worked, huh?
8574	Dr. Cox	I never had a chance.
8575	Jordan	You do realize I'm pregnant, don't you?

8582	J.D.	Wow.
8583	Turk	Sorry I ripped you off.
8584	J.D.	Ah, forget about it. You can keep the hundred bucks.
8585	Turk	I was gonna, man. I was gonna.
8586	J.D.'s Narration	I usually don't like thinking about the future. I mean, let's face it, you can't predict what's gonna happen.But sometimes, the thing you didn't expect is what you really wanted after all.Maybe the best thing to do is just stop trying to figure out where you're going, and just enjoy where you're at.
8587	Turk	All right, now, who wants a refill?
8588	Elliot	Gu I can't afford this place!
8589	J.D.	Elliot, I'm a hundred and thirty thousand dollars in debt. You're gonna be all right.

8591	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8592	J.D.	Oh, thank God.We were looking all over for you! Rowdy, bad!I don't know why he always goes to your door.Do you have a stuffed cat?
8593	Turk	Nothing?
8594	J.D.	Nada. That's fourteen times we've done it to him, and not one laugh.
8595	Turk	Mark it up.
8596	Carla	Let's get going to Elliot's.
8597	J.D.'s Narration	Elliot's dad cut her off financially. Luckily, she's got friends to rally around her.
8598	J.D.	You got any food?
8599	Carla	How're you holding up, Hon?
8600	Elliot	Okay...
8601	Turk	Yoooooo! Talk about a deluxe apartment in the sky! Elliot, it would really suck to lose this place—Then again, Elliot, this place is— Is that a jacuzzi on your deck?
8602	Elliot	Lately, I just feel like I'm drowning, you know?
8603	J.D.	This pear is delicious!Need help packing?
8604	J.D.'s Narration	As bad as things were going for Elliot...
8605	J.D.	Oh, God, that's good.
8606	J.D.'s Narration	...they were going pretty well for me.
8607	Dr. Cox	I guarantee you, that's a simple case of cellulitis right there.
8608	J.D.	Uhhhh, actually, Dr. Cox, I was watching TV last night, and they had this special on flesh-eating bacteria....
8609	Dr. Cox	Necrotizing fasciitis; yeeeesss?
8610	J.D.	Yeah, I think they called it "flesh-eating bacteria" to sound more flashy — you know, hook in all the idiots.
8611	Dr. Cox	Apparently it worked.
8612	J.D.	Anyhoo, point being, uh, they said it was very easy to confuse, uh, cellulitis with chompers...."Chompers" was the — the animated flesh-eating bacteria that — that narrated the special.
8613	Dr. Cox	Look, Britney, recently I made the potentially fatal mistake of getting back together with my ex-wife, who, angel that she is, is carrying the spawn of another man's seed. So forgive me if I sound a tad irritable when I tell you, I don't care what piece of irrelevant drivel you picked off TV while you were snuggled up in your Holly Hobbie P.J.s.
8614	J.D.'s Thoughts	Come on, trust yourself.
8615	J.D.	I think you're wrong.
8616	Dr. Cox	Really.Well, I think you're—
8617	Dr. Kelso	Brilliant! Necrotizing fasciitis! That's a one in a million diagnosis, son! One in a million!
8618	J.D.	Bah, it's nothing, sir. Anyone coulda made that call.
8619	Dr. Kelso	And yet, they didn't. The student becomes the teacher, eh, Perry? Haha... warms my heart.
8620	J.D.	Thank you, sir.
8621	Dr. Kelso	I don't care about you, son; I'm trying to do something here!Rats! He broke my rhythm.
8622	Dr. Cox	So, I'm guessin' this is just about the greatest moment of your life, huh, there, Newbie?
8623	J.D.'s Thoughts	Holy crap, it's David Copperfield!
8624	J.D.	Well, definitely top two.What's that I see in your ear...? Pa-ZOW!
8625	David Copperfield	Cool, a coin.
8626	J.D.	Do you want it?
8627	David Copperfield	Here, you take it.Haw-haw! Magic!
8628	J.D.	No, top three. Top three.
8629	Dr. Cox	Oh, God.
8630	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8631	J.D.'s Narration	By showing up Dr. Cox, I told the world I was no longer a child...
8632	Staffer	Yeah!
8633	J.D.'s Narration	...I was The Man.
8634	Doc	Great diagnosis!
8635	J.D.	You!
8636	Doc 2	There's Mr. Flesh-Eating Bacteria!
8637	J.D.	Grr!
8638	Nurse	Doctor. Could you sign these, please?
8639	J.D.	Ah! Sure. "To my two biggest fans."
8640	Nurse	Yeah. They're called breasts.
8641	J.D.	I — I know... I'm a doctor.
8642	Dr. Cox	You know, Eunice, you never even woulda made that catch if you weren't such an all-purpose nerd, sitting home alone on a Saturday night, watching some medical special on TV!
8643	J.D.	First of all, in your face, because it was Friday night; and secondly, I woulda made the catch regardless — you see, if you use your head and do some homework, medicine is just... it's basically science!
8644	Dr. Cox	Oh, puh-lease explain medicine to me! Because, without you, I don't know what to do!
8645	Dr. Kelso	Admitting it is the first step, Perry! Am I right, Ace?
8646	J.D.	You are correct, sir! Haha—
8647	Dr. Cox	That's enough on that one — I think we've clearly exhausted it.
8648	Jordan	Hey, Stud.
8649	Dr. Cox	Hello.
8650	Jordan	I hear wonder boy spanked your ass harder than I usually do.
8651	Dr. Cox	Ahh, such a lucky fetus!Not another damn word.
8652	Jordan	Yeah, I'll say whatever I want.
8653	J.D.'s Thoughts	Hell, yeah.
8654	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8655	Dr. Cox	Yes, hello? Could we please get my hormonal, extremely annoying ex-wife's amnio underway?
8656	Jordan	Wow, I can't wait to write that down in the baby journal.Could you be a bigger ass right now?
8657	Dr. Cox	Could you have a bigger ass right now?Owww!
8658	Carla	Why does he keep going back to her?
8659	Turk	I don't know. Why do people keep marrying Larry King? The man looks like a frog.
8660	Carla	Look, Dr. Cox and I go way back — I just hate to see him setting himself up to get hurt like this. I'm gonna talk to him.
8661	Turk	Here we go.
8662	Carla	What? Where we go?
8663	Turk	Sometimes you have a habit of telling other people how to live their lives, and... maybe, possibly, sometimes... people don't appreciate it that's— a little.
8664	Carla	Puh-lease! When do I ever get involved in people's personal business?Elliot, listen to me — you have to sit down and make a budget.
8665	Elliot	You know, I called my mom today, to see if she could convince my dad to send some cash, right? She says I should try and think of this whole thing as some kind of opportunity, and then she hung up on me!
8666	J.D.	Just like that?
8667	Elliot	Well, I may have told her that she spends more money dying her roots than I do on groceries. Still, this whole thing is just as much her fault as it is my father's — neither one of them prepared me for this.
8668	J.D.	Look, Elliot, my dad's an office supplies salesman. A bad one. So things were a little different for me, growing up.
8669	J.D.'s Dad	See, this is a bicycle bell. Now, you hold on to this, because I'm gonna give you a different part every year. Maybe after the party, we can take it out for a spin!
8670	Little J.D.	Great.
8671	J.D.'s Dad	'Kay?
8672	J.D.	Still waiting on that kick-stand.
8673	Elliot	It's just harder for me because I've always had everything. I got used to it. You guys never had to deal with that.
8674	Carla	Yeah, we're lucky.
8675	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8676	J.D.	I think patients are like snowflakes — no two are alike.
8677	Nurse Roberts	All right, we've got two new admissions — both male, both mid-forties, both with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
8678	J.D.'s Thoughts	I bet that snowflake thing is bogus, too.
8679	Dr. Cox	I say we let Super Doc here take 'em.
8680	J.D.	Oh, are you too busy eating sour grapes?
8681	Dr. Cox	Look who peeked in his shorts and found a pair! What are you, feeling like you finally took on the old man in a game of one-on-one and kicked his ass? Well, here's the news-flash, there, Skeetch: It was a fluke!
8682	J.D.	Well, believe what you want to believe. I'll do it again.
8683	Dr. Cox	All right, fair enough, here's your chance — two identical patients. I say we divide 'em up, just like in The Parent Trap. One goes with the sexy, free-wheeling, bachelor dad — hello. The other goes with the whiny, neurotic, sexually repressed mom — oh, just you all over.Oh, and I checked tonight's TV listings — there is no special on that disease, so you're gonna want to stop at the Blockbuster.
8684	J.D.	Please. I know all there is to know about thrombotic... thrombo... cyto — cytop-top-top-top... toppee— toppee—
8685	Nurse Roberts	Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
8686	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8687	Turk	Yeah, baby, just walk right by him. Okay? Just walk right by him. I'm proud of you. I'm... I'm so proud of you!
8688	Carla	Dr. Cox, hi!
8689	Turk	Dammit, I said walk right by him!
8690	Carla	Ohhhh.
8691	Turk	Hey, hey!
8692	Carla	Listen, um... We just think that getting back with Jordan might be a mistake.You guys just don't seem to... What am I trying to say, baby?
8693	Turk	I'unno.
8694	Carla	You just don't connect the way a couple should. Do you know what I mean?
8695	Dr. Cox	That pretty much the way you feel about it, there, Gandhi?
8696	Turk	Mmm-mm-mm!
8697	Dr. Cox	Interesting.
8698	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8699	Elliot	Mr. Bragen, it is so great to see you back in the hospital!
8700	Mr. Bragen	Woo-hoo! I've got a tube in my penis.
8701	Elliot	Come on, you're just a little dehydrated from the chemo. Plus, there are no signs whatsoever of your pancreatic cancer! You should be ecstatic! I mean, nine months ago, I told you you only had eight months to live, remember?
8702	Mr. Bragen	I vaguely recall that.
8703	Elliot	Yeah, of course you do. That is totally my fault! Who knew we could cure cancer!
8704	Mr. Bragen	I prepared myself, you know? I was really ready.
8705	Elliot	Yeah.
8706	Mr. Bragen	Dr. Reid, have you ever had to face your own mortality?
8707	Elliot	Before senior prom, I tried to wax my own eyebrows, and took them both clean off. Fft! Yeah!And by that, I mean no. Never.
8708	Mr. Bragen	Must have been a tough time for you, though.
8709	Elliot	Ohhh, sure.
8710	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8711	J.D.	Thanks for starting the Solu-Medrol on my TTP patient. And, Laverne, I'm sorry I'm being such a pain about this guy, it's just that Dr. Cox and I have this little competition going... and I know that probably seems insensitive to you....
8712	Nurse Roberts	Sweetheart, you don't have to explain yourself to me. But you'd better get your story straight when you come face-to-face with Jesus.
8713	J.D.'s Thoughts	Hmmm... the chart for Dr. Cox's TTP patient. I could look and see, but I'm not that insecure about my—
8714	J.D.	Oops! I. Will. Get. It!Yes! He's doing the exact same thing!
8715	J.D.'s Narration	When you work in a hospital, and things are going well, you should enjoy it while you can.Because, around every corner, there's something waiting to take it all away.
8716	Ted	Dr. Reid, I need to talk to you about your patient, Mr. Bragen.
8717	Elliot	Isn't it great! He's cancer-free!
8718	Ted	Yay. ...He's suing you for malpractice.
8719	Carla	It's okay, relax. I told him how I felt, he listened, and nobody got hurt! It's fine!
8720	Jordan	Yeah, which one of you two's been messing with my business?
8721	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, every once in a while, you manage to get away scot-free.
8722	J.D.	Hey, Dr. Cox! You'll be happy to know that I did everything for my patient that you did for yours.
8723	Dr. Cox	Oh, my God; I care so little, I almost passed out!
8724	Dr. Kelso	Hey, Ace. Your TTP patient coded — I pronounced him.
8725	J.D.	He died?
8726	Dr. Kelso	I certainly hope so, otherwise that autopsy's gonna be a bitch!
8727	Dr. Cox	Boy, that's tough.
8728	J.D.	What?
8729	Dr. Cox	I'd stay and talk you through this, but I gotta go check on my patient; you see, he's still alive.
8730	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, no.
8731	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8732	J.D.	How the hell did my patient die? I mean, you started corticosteroids, I started corticosteroids; you did plasmapheresis, I did plasmapheresis; you yelled at Mark the orderly, I yelled at Mark the orderly.Hey, Mark.
8733	Orderly	"Hey, Mark!"
8734	J.D.	See? He's pissed!
8735	Dr. Cox	That's because his name is Frank. Now, as far as your patient's concerned, well, Newbie, I'm afraid you forgot one very important thing.
8736	J.D.'s Narration	For whatever reason, I was finally fed up.
8737	J.D.	You know what, I've been working my ass off here for the last year and a half, and the last thing I need is another one of your condescending, never-ending speeches where you spoon-feed me some giant lesson and call me a girl's name.
8738	Dr. Cox	Well, then, have it your way, there, Carol. 'Cause I'm out.Good luck, everyone.
8739	J.D.	Go ahead, walk away! Because I'm not gonna obsess about this!Can you put a rush on this autopsy? I gotta figure this out.You got some crumbs in his hair.
8740	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8741	Elliot	A lawsuit!? So you're suing me because you're not dying?
8742	Mr. Bragen	Dr. Reid, I didn't want to face my mortality; you forced me to. And now I can't earn any money because my job seems trivial. I can't be in a relationship because what's the point? Oh, and here's the topper: Remember my horrible, judgmental father I hadn't spoken to in fifteen years? Well, good news, Doc — we patched things up! And guess who's coming over Saturday to watch the game and tell me what a jerk I am!
8743	Elliot	Well, you asked me to estimate how much time you had left!
8744	Mr. Bragen	And you told me I'd be dead by now!
8745	Elliot	Well, you're not! So sue me!
8746	Mr. Bragen	I am!
8747	Elliot	It was a figure of speech! And your dad was right about you!
8748	Mr. Bragen	Why don't you tell him yourself.
8749	Elder Bragen	Hey, ass-face!
8750	Mr. Bragen	Hiya, Pops.
8751	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8752	Turk	Excuse me, ma'am? Jordan?Carla has something she'd like to tell you. Carla?
8753	Carla	I didn't mean to upset you. Even though everything I said was true and you know it.
8754	Turk	Baby, that is a God-awful apology. That is just God-awful.
8755	Jordan	It's 'cause she's not really sorry. Honey, I know your type — it is so easy to see other people's problems from way up there on your pedestal. But you better be careful up there, 'cause if you fall off, and have to walk around down here with the rest of us? I don't know! You might catch a glimpse of yourself in a mirror, or surface of a pond, your boyfriend's gigantic, shiny head... and trust me, you're not gonna like what you see.
8756	Turk	My head's not—
8757	Jordan	Ow. Ow.
8758	Turk	A little help, here!
8759	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8760	Dr. Walsh	Sorry, kid. I didn't see anything unusual.
8761	J.D.	Couldn't he have bled out, or had an MI?
8762	Dr. Walsh	I don't know. I didn't look for any of those basic things, because I'm horrible at my job.
8763	Dr. Cox	Dr. Walsh. Murder, She Wrote!
8764	J.D.	Okay, fine, you caught me — I'm checking on my patient.
8765	Dr. Cox	How is that guy doing?
8766	Dr. Walsh	Not great!
8767	Dr. Cox	What in the hell is going on in here?
8768	OB-GYN	The amnio triggered premature labor.
8769	Dr. Cox	Excuse me, she's only twenty-four weeks. Jordan, cut it out right now!
8770	Jordan	Is he yelling at me?
8771	OB-GYN	Yes, he is. I'm gonna give you a shot of terbutaline.
8772	Jordan	And you know what else? He said I had a fat ass before.
8773	Dr. Cox	The nice kind?

8775	Ted	Look, I — I don't get a lot of women in here. What's your honest opinion of these drapes?
8776	Elliot	W— They're fine, Ted. But I'm getting sued!
8777	Ted	You're right. You're right, you're right. Now, by "fine"—
8778	Elliot	Ted!
8779	Ted	Okay, um, just time to calm down, now.
8780	Elliot	I'm fine.
8781	Ted	Actually, I was talking to myself. Now, uh, you haven't discussed the lawsuit with Mr. Bragen, have you?
8782	Elliot	A lawsuit!?It, uh, it sort of came up, yeah.
8783	Ted	Oh, God! Tell me you didn't antagonize him!
8784	Elliot	So sue me!
8785	Ted	Or admit fault!?
8786	Elliot	That is totally my fault!
8787	Ted	Oh, come on! A good lawyer couldn't win this case!!!
8788	Dr. Kelso	Ah! New drapes. They're awful!
8789	Elliot	Dr. Kelso, why does everything keep happening to me?
8790	Dr. Kelso	Take a breath, Dr. Reid. In, and out; that's it. That's it.Now, you went to four years of college, and four years of medical school, so I can safely presume that you are at least eight.My God, little girl, grow up and say "how do" to the world of modern medicine! My God! I've been sued four times!Come on, Ted, let's go.
8791	Ted	Let's go!
8792	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8793	Turk	I think you should just go in there and apologize to her.
8794	Carla	No! I didn't say anything that wasn't true! I just want to see if she's okay.
8795	Turk	She's fine.
8796	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8797	Dr. Cox	Laverne? Would you please have the nurse covering Jordan page me the moment she wakes up?
8798	Nurse Roberts	Sure.
8799	Dr. Cox	Thank you.
8800	J.D.	Hey, Dr. Cox. I'm sorry, I was just so frustrated before. So, now I'm here, why don't you go ahead and tell me what I forgot?
8801	Dr. Cox	Can I? Really?
8802	J.D.	Sure! Hit me.
8803	Dr. Cox	How about, "Go to hell, Shakira."
8804	J.D.	What?!
8805	Dr. Cox	What, now that you've decided you're ready to listen, how does it work, huh? You gonna pull a string on my back? Well, step right up and give it a tug. But, I'm warning you, I bet it keeps coming up "Go to hell, Shakira."
8806	J.D.	Why do you always have to be like that? You know that I try harder than anyone in this place, and you never give me any credit!
8807	Dr. Cox	Now, you listen to me, Newbie. I'm not doing this because I get my jollies off of being your mentor, and I'm damn sure not doing it so that years from now I can say, "Boy, I knew him when." I'm doing it because if I don't, people would die.
8808	J.D.	Thanks for your help.
8809	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8810	Elliot	You know what, Mr. Bragen? I figured something out.
8811	Mr. Bragen	That damn nurse broke my bed.
8812	Elliot	That's just it — you blame everyone else for anything that goes wrong in your life. Like this. The nurse didn't break your bed. You just press this button.All right, it is...broken. The point is, if you hate your job, maybe you need to switch careers; if you can't get into a relationship, maybe you have problems with commitment, huh? And I know that I'm right, 'cause I'm the exact same way: I blame my parents for not preparing me for the real world, I blame this hospital for taking up all of my time; I'm even blaming you for jeopardizing my future! But, you know what? It's time for me to grow up and start holding myself accountable. And I'm doing it.
8813	Mr. Bragen	Good for you!
8814	Elliot	You're, um, still suing me, aren't you.
8815	Mr. Bragen	Yeah. But I feel like now you'll be able to handle it!
8816	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8817	Turk	You know what? We're just gonna have to get him fixed. Good news is, he doesn't need to go to a vet — 'cause we could just pop these things right off!YES! Baby, you have got to tell J.D., because he is not gonna believe it!
8818	Carla	Jordan was right about me. I'm insecure, and I judge people to cover up for it. I mean, even right now, all I can think about is to tell you that you're a surgeon now, and if you want to be taken seriously you have to start acting like an adult.
8819	Turk	And you had to say all of that?
8820	Carla	Well, you have a habit of not listening to things unless people spell them out for you!— Oh, my God, I can't stop!
8821	Turk	Baby, maybe it's something you need to work on, that's all?
8822	Carla	Sweetie, I promise you, I will never, ever, tell you what to do ever again.
8823	Turk	Yeah, you will. But with me, it's okay, because I love you.Besides, I barely listen, anyway.Come on, Rowdy! Let's go, boy! Let's hit up the fourth floor.Whoa, whoa, boy! Whoa! Slow down!
8824	J.D.'s Narration	As I sat there, still searching for answers about my patient, I realized that I still needed Dr. Cox. It's hard to face a harsh truth about yourself.I guess the only thing you can do is try to take positive steps.Unfortunately, it's hard to take positive steps when you've burned the bridge you need to walk across.
8825	Dr. Cox	It was luck.
8826	J.D.	What?
8827	Dr. Cox	The thing that you forgot? Turns out, whatever you know about medicine, ultimately, luck or fate or God or... who knows what is always gonna end up playing a much bigger role in the whole thing than you and I ever will. Hell, it was lucky you were watching that show the other night. And it was unlucky that your patient went the other way, even though you did absolutely everything right; and, for the record, you did. I was looking over your shoulder every step of the way.
8828	J.D.	Thanks.
8829	Dr. Cox	Wasn't a favor, Newbie. It was my job.
8830	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8831	J.D.	Hey, how ya doin'.
8832	Turk	I know we put on a hell of a show, but, dude, put some shades on or something!
8833	J.D.	Let's not make a big deal out of this.
8834	Carla	J.D., when was the last time you got laid?
8835	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, just subtly take the spotlight off yourself.
8836	J.D.	Once, on a red-eye flight, Turk groped a trans-sexual.
8837	Turk	Baby, it was dark, and he/she had a body that was rockin'!
8838	J.D.'s Thoughts	Mission accomplished.
8839	Carla	We're talking about you right now, studly.
8840	J.D.	Okay! So I'm in a bit of a dry spell.... I have no idea what to do with myself.
8841	Turk	Why don't you give Rowdy a bath he smells a little ripe.
8842	J.D.	Please! I'm a young, single player with a heart of gold. I should be able to stir something up.How _do_ you get so dirty?...Rowdy!
8843	J.D.'s Narration	I'm not the only one in a rut.
8844	Elliot	My life is a mess!
8845	J.D.	At least you're pretty.
8846	Elliot	Yeah, well, pretty don't pay the rent!
8847	Carla	It does for my sister.
8848	Elliot	Oh, my God, your sister's a prostitute!?
8849	Carla	She's a _model_. Come on, Elliot, we talked about thinking before we speak.
8850	Elliot	Yeah, I know, I was just frazzled. I stopped taking my dad's money, so I can't pay the bills; I'm getting kicked out of my apartment; and thank-you to this stupid hospital, I haven't even had time to look for a new place!
8851	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes the hospital seems like a big, hungry monster that feeds on our personal lives.It affects all of us.
8852	J.D.	Morning, Dr. Cox!
8853	Dr. Cox	Oh, ho, ho, Denise! I know it's morning. If it was last night, I'd still be with my extremely pregnant ex-wife, trying to get her to calm down with a chair and a whip because believe it or not I somehow managed to forget to bring home the _curly fries_. Do you see where I'm going here? Yes, no, maybe so? Talk to her!
8854	Nurse Roberts	The man's got troubles.
8855	Lady	You know, you're about one of the cutest doctors I've ever met! Give me a kiss!
8856	J.D.	Ha! Well.... Put it in your pocket and save it for later!
8857	J.D.'s Narration	The monster kills everything that's beautiful. Everything! ....Except Lisa, the Gift Shop girl!
8858	Choir Director	Okay, boys, remember, now: When we get upstairs, it's the trauma ward, not the "drama ward," so smiles, everyone. Smiles.
8859	J.D.'s Thoughts	Whatever. Dry spell, prepare to be moistened!
8860	J.D.	Hey, Lisa! How you doin'?
8861	Lisa	J.D., I can't give you free gum.
8862	J.D.	Free gum No! You know, I was just thinking, you're probably one of those girls that's so pretty that no one ever has the courage to ask you out.
8863	Lisa	No, I get asked out all the time.
8864	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, momentary set-back. Regroup. Regroup!
8865	J.D.	Hey, go out with me.It's the right thing to do.
8866	Lisa	Sure, why not.
8867	Choir	Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
8868	J.D.	Very funny, you dumb choir punks! Santa's a drunk! Where were we?
8869	Lisa	So...what did you have in mind?
8870	J.D.	Ohh, I could think of a couple things....
8871	Lisa	How _does_ he get so dirty?

8878	J.D.	Hold me down! Know what I'm sayin'?
8879	Turk	Hey, look at me. I want you to turn Gift Shop Girl into Gift Shop Woman.

8884	J.D.	Okay...whatever. Look, if you're hungry, man, I can loan you a buck.
8885	Janitor	A buck! What a kind offer from the charitable Dr. Moneybags!
8886	J.D.	Look, you can either be a jerk as usual or you can accept this gracious offer and get some caramel draped in nougat. Your choice, Jumpsuit.

8888	Dr. Cox	You know, Jordan, I have to tell you despite how crazy-hormonal you are, there is something about a pregnant woman that's almost spiritual.
8889	Jordan	Really?
8890	Dr. Cox	Honestly you
8891	Jordan	Mm-hmm.
8892	Dr. Cox	you have never looked so beautiful.
8893	Jordan	It's the giant boobs, isn't it.
8894	Dr. Cox	Well, have you seen them lately?
8895	Jordan	Yes. Relax.
8896	J.D.	I've seen bigger.No, not you. Although, kudos!
8897	Nurse Roberts	Mmm-hmm.
8898	Jordan	You know what I hate?
8899	Dr. Cox	So many things....
8900	Jordan	That's true. I stay at your house almost every night, and even though I feel like crap in the morning, I've gotta drive all the way back to my apartment to get ready and then drive all the way back here to go to board meetings.
8901	Dr. Cox	Well, then, why don't you just leave your boobs and some other stuff at my place?
8902	Jordan	Really?
8903	Dr. Cox	Well, yeah.... If it saves you the hassle, bring it on.
8904	Jordan	Well, great. See you tonight.
8905	J.D.	So, it appears Mrs. Watson has developed a post-op infection at her thyroidectomy site.
8906	Mrs. Watson	Ow!
8907	Dr. Cox	Newbie, when a patient has an infection, I make it a general policy not to actually push on it. Just start Ancef 1 gram Q 8 hours, and oh, my God, did I just ask my ex-wife to move in with me?
8908	J.D.	Mmm-hmm.What? You don't own that!

8910	Carla	Turk! Come help me wrap presents!
8911	Turk	Baby. Do you realize how long it's been since we've had an afternoon off, just the two of us?
8912	Carla	Yeah....
8913	Turk	I mean, I'm thinking I should give you a sensual massage...rub your feet a little...and maybe, if you're interested, sex you up and what-not!
8914	Carla	Come here.
8915	Turk	I'll get the TV.
8916	Carla	No, you know what? Leave it on. I know how much you like 'The Jeffersons'.
8917	Turk	Baby, you're a gift from God!Here come daddy! Roooaaarrr!I'm gonna rock your world!

8920	Elliot	Huh! I put all those fliers up, and nobody wants me to live with them!
8921	J.D.	Oh, come on, Elliot. I'm sure you'll eventually find a roommate who's a clean, non-smoking vegetarian that rinses the shower thoroughly after each usage.
8922	Elliot	Oh, well, if you don't, it gets mildewy.
8923	J.D.	You know, you should move in with my friend: Anal McLooney.
8924	Elliot	I am so screwed! I had to move out of my apartment this morning all of my stuff is outside in a truck.
8925	J.D.	Why don't you just crash with me and Turk till you find a place?
8926	Elliot	I am so tired of everyone always thinking that I need to be rescued! Okay, J.D.?
8927	J.D.	Fine.
8928	Dr. Kelso	Can anyone tell me the bacterial etiology of toxic shock syndrome?Oh, I beg your pardon. So many doctors standing around, I assumed it was rounds!
8929	Elliot	Oh
8930	Dr. Kelso	But you were looking at the wall, so that means it's an...art exhibit! When does the gay gentleman come 'round with the tray of champagne?
8931	Elliot	Sir, my father cut me off
8932	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Reid, this is not Bring Your Problems to Work Day. This is just Work Day.
8933	Elliot	But, sir! Only one person took a phone number...so far!
8934	Todd	Someone's getting a late-night drunk call from The Todd.
8935	J.D.	Lucky girl.
8936	Todd	Yeah!
8937	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8938	J.D.	All right, Mrs. Carlson, the surgeon that's gonna come by and do your lymph node dissection is a very handsome young man, so I don't want you to forget about me, okay? I'm serious, you naughty girl!
8939	Dr. Cox	Sure, Jordan...I guess you could take over the master bathroom. But, would you do me a favor and leave my sleeping pills out in case, when I get home, I want to take 300 of them? Okay, bye.
8940	J.D.	I can't stop obsessing about this date I have tonight. What do you think I should do?
8941	Dr. Cox	Well, for starters, you should probably go ahead and thank your lucky stars that you finally found a gal who's into same-sex relationships.
8942	J.D.	You know, Perry
8943	Dr. Cox	"Perry"?
8944	J.D.	Yeah, I'm trying it out. I find, with the ladies, if you're clear with your intentions right off the bat, they just fall in to place. A.Q.?
8945	Dr. Cox	What!?
8946	J.D.	"A.Q." is sort of a new, hip expression means "Any questions?"
8947	Dr. Cox	Look, please don't think I'm impressed because you managed to score a sympathy date with whatever homely-looking chick is managing the gift shop nowadays.
8948	Lisa	J.D.! You ready to go?
8949	J.D.	Oh, yeah, the word you're looking for is "Wow." And the words I'm looking for are "In your face." Yeah! I'm ready, let's get going.P.O. peace out.
8950	Dr. Cox	Jordan, if you're feeling like crap, then I'll come straight home Of...course, with the food. No, I don't necessarily know if there is anything bigger than a super-size, but I'll I'll ask the guy.
8951	Jordan	Get _two_ super-sizes!

8954	Turk	Oh, hell yeah! ...Did I fall asleep?
8955	Carla	Yes.
8956	Turk	Was that before or after I rocked your world?
8957	Carla	He's a good man, he's a good man, he's a good man....
8958	Turk	Baby, you know I get nervous when you start chanting.
8959	Carla	Turk, what happened to all my stuff? The massage? The back, the feet? I let you watch 'The Jeffersons'!
8960	Turk	Baby, I was...just exhausted from work.
8961	Carla	Well, when you were an intern you were always exhausted from work, but you always made time for romance.
8962	Turk	Oh, that's 'cause I was still trying to get into your delicates.
8963	Carla	Oh, my God.

8965	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Reid? What are you doing in here?
8966	Elliot	Um...Sorry, hi Dr. Kelso, I just, uh...I um..... I was on call. Yeah.
8967	Dr. Kelso	Well, I have the call sheet right here, and, uh......your name doesn't seem to be on it? But what do I know.... I'm just a kindly old man who doesn't know the difference between a doctor on call and one who maybe just needs a warm bed for the night.
8968	Elliot	Oh, I've just been so swamped with work, I couldn't even make time to find a new place.
8969	Dr. Kelso	I understand. Life is hard, and all that. But, if you want a bed in my hospital, you better have a damn rent check...or a massive coronary in the next five seconds. And, believe me, missy, either one's fine with me.
8970	Elliot	Thank you, sir?
8971	Dr. Kelso	No problem.

8973	J.D.	I had a really good time tonight.
8974	Lisa	I gotta tell you, I was a little nervous when you spent the first five minutes talking through a napkin.
8975	J.D.	Oh, that wasn't me that was Nappy, The Ice-Breaking Puppet.
8976	Lisa	Oh!
8977	J.D.	That little guy earned his money tonight.
8978	Lisa	So you think you're in, huh?
8979	J.D.	Oh, come on, I am so in.
8980	Lisa	Come on, you can't be sure.
8981	J.D.	No, I feel pretty good about it. You want me.
8982	Lisa	I don't!
8983	J.D.	Uh, yeah, I'm a doctor; all the symptoms are there you do.
8984	Lisa	Just kiss me.
8985	J.D.	Whoa. Heh. Uh.... You know, I thought I had to sneeze, but it was a false alarm. Let's do this.
8986	Lisa	Okay.
8987	J.D.	You know what it is? It's like a tickling. I got this, like this, like weird, like...it's a flutter. Erp!
8988	Lisa	Nappy?
8989	J.D.	Yeah?
8990	Lisa	I want you to stop fooling around, and Give me a kiss.
8991	J.D.'s Narration	I guess you never know how the monster's gonna attack.
8992	Carla	All right, we need to talk about this.
8993	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes it pulls you away at the absolute worst time.
8994	Turk	Babe, I'm sorry.
8995	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes it even takes the roof over your head.And sometimes, the monster takes something you never thought you could lose.......Like your mojo.
8996	Lisa	Is that a roll of quarters in your pocket or are you just having a really good time?
8997	J.D.	Actually, it's a roll of quarters. It's uh...laundry day! Heh.

9001	J.D.'s Thoughts	So, Little J.D. isn't rising to the occasion. It's not a big deal! Nobody knows about this but me!
9002	Dr. Cox	Hey, Newbie, what's up?
9003	J.D.	Everything! Everything's up!
9004	Dr. Kelso	Rise and shine, sport!
9005	J.D.'s Thoughts	What, did someone send out a flier?!
9006	Todd	Hey, J.D.! How's your penis?
9007	J.D.'s Thoughts	All right, calm down, he says that to everyone.
9008	Todd	Hey, Goldman! How's your penis?
9009	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, you're freaking out! Just keep your head down, and move.
9010	Janitor	Hm? Oh, I get it! I haven't paid you back, so you won't even look at me?
9011	J.D.	No.
9012	Janitor	It's been one day, you greedy little bastard!
9013	J.D.'s Thoughts	See what you did!
9014	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Reid, your truck is double-parked.
9015	J.D.'s Narration	Luckily for me, I had a friend I could talk to about anything.
9016	J.D.	Hey, Turk. Do you ever have any trouble getting your manhood going?
9017	Turk	Hell, no!
9018	J.D.	Heh, heh. Me neither, dawg!
9019	J.D.'s Thoughts	Apparently I'm the only one here with women problems.
9020	Jordan	Listen, Perry, shockingly, I'm not really looking to make the permanent move to your little bachelor cave over there at Swingers Towers. What happened is, is you made a kind gesture, and I made the mistake of thinking you could follow actually through with it. Do you get it?
9021	Carla	You don't get it, do you, Turk? We've only been together for a year-and-a-half the romance can't be gone yet! Does this make any sense to you?
9022	Lisa	Because it doesn't to me. One minute, we're clicking; and the next, you're running for your life. What's going on?
9023	J.D.'s Narration	I know we seem insensitive, but in a crunch-time, most guys are smart enough to say the right thing.
9024	Turk	Baby...you have got to chill!
9025	Dr. Cox	I'm sorry, um...crazy person says what?
9026	Jordan	What!?
9027	Dr. Cox	Thatta girl.
9028	J.D.'s Narration	But sometimes the worst thing a guy can say is nothing at all.

9031	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Reid! I have no reading material for my daily post-lunch...well, let's just call it "reading session." I need your research proposal. Or a Vanity Fair if you have one.
9032	Elliot	Dr. Kelso, if I could just get...a little more time on that
9033	Dr. Kelso	Oh, I'm sorry, sweetheart. I'm fresh out of special treatment today. I used it all trying not to stare at that albino doctor down in Radiology.
9034	Carla	Don't let him get to you! Just keep saying positive things to yourself.
9035	Elliot	It's too much! I'm just one person!
9036	Carla	Atta girl!
9037	Elliot	Sometimes I just get so jealous of Turk, you know? I mean, we're residents now, and we're just so swamped, and he just never seems to show it. I guess...that's because he's got you to pick up the slack when he doesn't have the energy.
9038	Carla	Yeah.... You would think so.Aren't you gonna get that?
9039	Elliot	Nah, it's just Todd. He's already called, like, four times to ask if I want to move into his pants.
9040	J.D.'s Narration	You never expect a cliché to be an actual conversation starter.
9041	Turk	Women! Huh?
9042	Dr. Cox	Tell me about it.
9043	J.D.	It's like they're from another planet!
9044	Dr. Cox	Okay. I'm going to engage you two in a conversation. And you speak of it to no one, agreed?
9045	J.D.	Okay...?
9046	Dr. Cox	It has gotten to the point where I'm starting to go back in my head over all my old relationships. I mean, don't get me wrong, it's not like I'm going to sit here and count up all the women I've ever slept with....
9047	Turk	Twelve.
9048	J.D.	Nine.
9049	Dr. Cox	Eighteen. But not one of them ever really understood me.
9050	Turk	I'm feelin' you, man. I mean, I consider myself a really romantic guy who's just a little stressed out. And I thought the one person who'd understand that would be Carla.
9051	Dr. Cox	You know what the weird thing is, is that I'm actually _trying_ this time.
9052	Turk	I just wonder if I'm what she really wants.
9053	Dr. Cox	I just wonder if I'll ever be able to make it work out with anyone.
9054	J.D.	My peep's on the fritz.
9055	Turk	Dude!
9056	Dr. Cox	Oh, poor Newbie.
9057	J.D.	No, no! No, no, no, no! No, I'm talking about you guys! 'Cause y-y-y-you guys are like you guys are like my peeps, you're my dawgs, and you on the fritz. So, there that's where I get "peeps"/"fritz" came from.
9058	Dr. Cox	God love you, Newbie.Thank you for...giving me some perspective.
9059	Janitor	There's your stupid dollar. And, by the way, your new nickname is Pee-Pee LeFritz. Enjoy.

9061	Elliot	Hey.

9063	Elliot	Yeah, so? It's, uh, it's cozy.... Hospital-adjacent.
9064	J.D.	Elliot! Come on! This is crazy you're living out of a van like a hobo...or...Jewel.
9065	Elliot	Her poetry changed my life.
9066	J.D.	Look, I know you want to show everyone you can stand on your own two feet, but you don't have to prove anything to me. Come on, come stay with me and Turk.
9067	Turk	What'd you page me to the roof for?
9068	Carla	Well, I was thinking that you work so hard.... And that if I want surprise and romance that maybe it's my turn to be the one who brings it. So, I brought us a couple of salads...
9069	Turk	That's great.
9070	Carla	...a box of thirty-six hot-wings...
9071	Turk	Now that's what I'm talkin' 'bout!
9072	Carla	...and some blue cheese dressing!
9073	Turk	I LOVE THIS WOMAN!
9074	J.D.'s Narration	I guess, in the end, the monster's always gonna be there.
9075	Jordan	Curly fries?
9076	Dr. Cox	Aww!
9077	J.D.'s Narration	And sometimes that means letting a friend help you out.
9078	Elliot	Um...thanks again, J.D.
9079	J.D.	Don't sweat it. Well, have a good night.
9080	Elliot	You too.
9081	J.D.'s Narration	As for me, I just have to hope that my problem will eventually work itself out.

9085	J.D.'s Narration	Since she lost her apartment, I decided to let Elliot crash on my floor.
9086	J.D.	How did this happen?
9087	Elliot	J.D., I'm homeless; I have no money, and everything I own is outside in a truck my life's a mess. Plus, you were...going through...a lot, too....
9088	J.D.	My peep was on the fritz. Much better now, thank you for asking.
9089	Elliot	The point is, we were stressed out and vulnerable, and we made a mistake.
9090	J.D.	Four times.... And a half, if you count that last thing.
9091	Elliot	By the way, that third time? Wow! Where did you learn that?
9092	Turk	What'cha watching, buddy?
9093	J.D.	Animal Planet.
9094	Turk	Why does that one monkey keep biting the other one on the ass?
9095	J.D.	I don't know...but she seems to _love_ it!The Congo. But look, Elliot, I think I think you're right last night was great, but w-we can't keep doing this.Dr. Reid.
9096	Elliot	Dr. Dorian.
9097	J.D.'s Narration	Mistake or not, one cool thing about sex is, it always seems to put you in a good mood.Hell, I think it even cheers up the people around you.
9098	Dr. Cox	Oh, joy I get to work on Mrs. Credin with The Wonder Twins. Dear Lord, what in thy most holy name have I done to have offended thee so?
9099	Elliot	My bother Bradley and I used to always pretend that we were The Wonder Twins he would always become "Form of a Dragon!" and then I would want to be a dragon, too, but he said I had to be something made of water. So I'd be like, "Shape of an Ice Dragon!" And then...he would say that I was copying him and he'd breathe on me and I'd have to melt, but it was still _so_ awesome.
9100	Dr. Cox	That's funny, I don't recall asking for a really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really re-hhhheally boring story. My God, Barbie! Don't you understand no one cares?
9101	Turk	I care.
9102	Dr. Cox	Correction: No one important cares. Now, Mrs. Credin is in post-op, so let's start her out by CAT-scanning her abdomen. Oh, and, gosh, all kidding aside I'd really like to see us work together on this one. Come on, now! "Duh-duh-duh-du-du-du-duhn!" Hands in! "Duh-duh-duh-du-du-du-duhn!" Woo! Please!

9110	Carla	Me?
9111	J.D.'s Narration	Don't get me wrong, Carla loves her patients but she also loves how much they love her.
9112	Carla	To be honest, I'm not a big fan. I mean, I've always wondered what the kid would say if it were up to him.
9113	Baby	You want to do what, now!? I just got this thing!
9114	Carla	There're really no medical advantages to circumcision.
9115	Woman	I told you.
9116	Man	I'm not talking about medical, I'm talking about personal.
9117	Woman	And you wanted to slice into his manhood to pluck his fruit.

9136	J.D.	Look, Elliot, we're adults. I don't think we have to apologize for enjoying what we're doing.
9137	J.D.'s Narration	And that's when she said the words every man is dying to hear.

9150	Janitor	Can't...or won't?
9151	J.D.	Can't!
9152	Janitor	WON'T!
9153	Carla	Are they still going at it?
9154	J.D.	Nah. Kelso calmed 'em down. I think we're okay.
9155	Carla	We're not okay.
9156	J.D.	What are you talking about?
9157	J.D.'s Thoughts	Ohhhh.
9158	Turk	Elliot! You said you were gonna get that CAT-scan of Mrs. Credin's abdomen.
9159	Elliot	I have been crazy-busy. I was stuck on the phone all morning with bill collectors who, by the way, are obsessed with money! I spent an hour in my truck looking for clean bras because all I've got left is this date-night push-up one and, to be honest, I don't like working with these things under my chin all day. Plus, I am walking _someplace_ right now, and, for the life of me, I can't remember where.
9160	Turk	Don't worry about it, I'll take care of it for you.
9161	Elliot	Thanks.
9162	Turk	Mm-hmm.
9163	Elliot	Bathroom!
9164	Dr. Kelso	Does this name tag say "Chief of Medicine"?
9165	J.D.	Uh, yes, sir.
9166	Dr. Kelso	Funny. Because that couple back there thought it said, "Hi, I'm Bob, ask me about your baby's johnson!" Dammit, in my hospital, we do not go out on a limb with our opinions!
9167	Carla	So, what? If a patient has questions in 'your hospital,' you just ignore them?
9168	Dr. Kelso	Look: Stay away from definite answers. Leave yourself some wiggle room. Say things like, We'll do what we can, or We'll get back to you on that, or...Hell, I don't know.
9169	J.D.	Couldn't think of a third one, sir?
9170	Dr. Kelso	That _was_ the third one. Ass-face.
9171	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9172	Dr. Cox	Hey, Chum! Whatta ya say? Listen, I just wanted to tell ya not to worry about getting that silly CAT-scan on Mrs. Credin; because it turns out I'm just gonna rip her stitches open, jam my head in there, and have a look around for myself.
9173	Turk	Okay, Dr.
9174	Dr. Cox	Dammit! When I tell you to do something, you sure as hell better get it done!
9175	J.D.'s Narration	It sucks being yelled at. Especially when it's someone else's fault.
9176	Todd	T-Dog, that was big of you to cover for Elliot. You know, I had a good mind to spank her yesterday.
9177	Turk	What, she screw up with one of your patients, too?
9178	Todd	No.
9179	Turk	Still, Elliot seems so frazzled, she keeps making one mistake after another. I mean, I wish I could help her out. I have no idea how that woman handles the stress.
9180	Elliot	Woo! I feel _so_ much better! See ya, bud!
9181	J.D.	Later, dude.
9182	Carla	You know, Mr. Woodbury's son is getting married this weekend; he keeps asking me if he's gonna be able to go.
9183	J.D.	He's had a nasty case of pneumonia. Let's see. Well, his leukocytosis is resolved, and his blood cultures are negative.... Tell him we'll do the best we can.
9184	Carla	Oh, come on! Can't we just tell him that he can go?
9185	J.D.	Where's the wiggle room in that? There's no wiggle!Fine. Let me just tell him with you so I can enjoy it, too.
9186	Mr. Woodbury	Thank you so much!
9187	Carla	Oh! Oh, you're so very welcome! It's my pleasure.
9188	Mr. Woodbury	This is great.
9189	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9190	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, just give her a casual nod you don't want Turk to know what's going on.
9191	Turk	Dude, you're totally hitting that.
9192	J.D.	How do you do that?
9193	Turk	It's a gift. Now, you remember what happened the last time you two got together, right?
9194	J.D.	Oh, relax, man. We're just having fun.
9195	Turk	What are you guys, just sex buddies or something?
9196	J.D.	Fo' shizzle.
9197	Turk	Okay.I don't wanna get all Dr. Phil on you, but the last time I checked, women have a hard time separating sex from emotions. So, you may think you're just tappin' that right now, but pretty soon she's gonna be like, "J.D., I need you."
9198	J.D.	Look, if it ever got that emotional, I'd break it off.
9199	Turk	Okay. Oh, by the way, dude right there is totally hitting that dude! He's totally hitting him!
9200	J.D.	You are good!
9201	Turk	I know.
9202	J.D.	I'm so glad Esteban found someone!
9203	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9204	Dr. Cox	What's up, Laverne?
9205	Nurse Roberts	This Friday, my church group's doing a production of 'Rent', if you want to go?
9206	Dr. Cox	Yeah.... What's up that doesn't make me want to shoot myself?
9207	Elliot	How's Mr., uh....Lawrence doing?
9208	Dr. Cox	I'm afraid that's no longer any of your business he's not your patient as of 2 o'clock this afternoon. He asked for a new doctor.
9209	Elliot	That's the second patient to switch off of my service today, what is the deal?
9210	Dr. Cox	Maybe they were both so overwhelmed by the high quality of your care that they just couldn't stand it another second.
9211	Elliot	You know what? I'm not gonna let you make me feel like crap today. Every doctor here including you has had patients switch off of them for no reason at all, and it is just some dumb little coinkydink that it happened to me twice on the same day. Now, if, uh, the two of you will excuse me, I have to go check on Mrs. Finnegan's chest x-rays.
9212	Nurse Roberts	Uh, no you don't. She switched off, too.
9213	J.D.'s Narration	Around here, things can turn bad in a heartbeat.
9214	Dr. Kelso	Sweetheart, Mr. Woodbury is still requiring a lot of O2, I'm afraid we're gonna have to keep him here over the weekend. Do me a favor: Give him the skinny, will you.
9215	J.D.'s Narration	I guess when you work in a world of uncertainty, it's great to have something at home you can count on.
9216	J.D.	Elliot? What are you doing?
9217	Elliot	Sitting in the dark...crying. So, you know, the usual.
9218	J.D.	Oh. Okay.
9219	Elliot	J.D., I had such a crappy day. I really need you right now. Come here.
9220	J.D.'s Thoughts	She needs you? Oh, my God, Turk was right. You have to stop kissing her, and put an end to this before she gets hurt!
9221	Elliot	Is there something wrong?
9222	J.D.'s Thoughts	Eh, she's a tough kid you can tell her later.
9223	J.D.	Nope!
9224	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9225	J.D.'s Thoughts	What did you do? All right, don't panic! Maybe she didn't enjoy it.... Oh, come on, who're you kidding?
9226	Elliot	I just don't get it. I mean, why are so many of my patients switching off on me? Are my hands _that_ cold?
9227	J.D.	Ohhh.
9228	Elliot	You didn't tell anyone that I'm Republican, did you?
9229	J.D.	No!
9230	Elliot	God, this can't be happening! I'm a doctor! What the hell use is being a doctor if nobody lets you treat them? What is going on with my life?
9231	J.D.	Mmmmm.
9232	J.D.'s Thoughts	This is not the time to talk it out. So you just need to get out of the situation without making her suspicious.
9233	J.D.	Hello? ... Oh, hi, Mom! ... Yeah! I miss you, too! I haven't spoken to you in so long.Hi, Mr. Turk. ... No, Chris isn't here. ... No! No, sir, I didn't say "Mom," I said..."mon," like, "Hey, mon, we be jammin'!" ... N-no, sir, I don't think all black people are Jamaican.I I love you too, Mommy!Sir, could you call back later? Chris will be home.
9234	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9235	Janitor	Yeah, there's been some break-ins, I had to change all the locks on these lockers. You should have gotten your new combination in the mail.
9236	J.D.	Well, I didn't. Do you know what it is?
9237	Janitor	Yeah.
9238	J.D.	But you're not gonna tell me, are you.
9239	Janitor	Can't. Janitor-locker confidentiality.
9240	J.D.'s Thoughts	He made that up.
9241	Turk	Are you watching 'Sesame Street'?
9242	Elliot	You know, when I was a kid, I had my first sex dream about Mr. Hooper. Least I think it was a sex dream he was trying to choke me.
9243	Turk	Yeah, that that's sweet. Um, what, are you on a break or something?
9244	Elliot	Well, I have nothing else to do, because none of my patients want to see me.
9245	Turk	But that's a good thing, right? Because, now, you have time to take care of your life!
9246	Elliot	Why are you being so weird?
9247	Dr. Cox	Well, of course, that could be because he's shaving his dome so much lately that the hair is actually starting to grow inward it's an affliction commonly known as the "infro." But, if I were to guess just exactly why he's been acting weird lately, I would say it's because...he's the one who's been steering your patients away from you.Discuss.
9248	J.D.'s Thoughts	Carla has to give Mr. Woodbury the bad news.
9249	Mr. Woodbury	I love this nurse ... She's wonderful!
9250	Carla	How bad could it be?
9251	Mr. Woodbury	Oh, look, here she is! Come on in! I want you to meet my family!
9252	J.D.'s Thoughts	I wonder how he'll take it?
9253	Mr. Woodbury	Take her! Out the window! Throw her out the window!
9254	Carla	Here goes.
9255	J.D.	Wait, wait, you know what? Come on...Mr. Woodbury's doing well enough to be discharged. I don't mind standing up to Kelso on this one. Time to take the "G-R" off my gratitude and give that old bastard some attitude, J.D. style!
9256	Carla	His office is that way.
9257	J.D.	I know, I have to go throw up first.
9258	Carla	Oh....'kay.

9260	Elliot	What the hell, Turk!
9261	Dr. Cox	Ohhh, good, Barbie! Now really access the anger!
9262	Elliot	How could you do that to me?
9263	Dr. Cox	Yeah, honestly. How could you?
9264	Turk	Okay, I just wanted to protect you give you a little break.
9265	Dr. Cox	The old "I'm trying to help you" gambit? Barbie, see through that. Yo' kick him! Yo' kick him right now!
9266	Turk	Elliot....
9267	Dr. Cox	"I'm sorry!"
9268	Turk	Elliot!
9269	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9270	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, now's your chance. You're at work, so she won't get emotional. Walk in there, and tell her things are getting too serious. Just...butter her up first.
9271	J.D.	Well, look at you, Miss No One's Ever Gonna Want Me To Be Their Doctor Again! I don't see Mr. Ellis, here, complaining.
9272	Elliot	He's in a coma.
9273	J.D.	Elliot, we should talk.
9274	Elliot	I found out that Turk was telling my patients to switch off of my service.
9275	J.D.	What?
9276	Elliot	Yeah, he said he was trying to protect me.
9277	J.D.	I'll go talk to him.That I.V. looks like it's infiltrating. Nurse must've screwed up.
9278	Elliot	Um. I did that.
9279	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9280	Dr. Kelso	Well, what's with the mouthful of Chicklets, sweetheart?
9281	Carla	Oh, no special reason, sir.
9282	Dr. Kelso	Really? I thought it might be because young Dr. Dorian came to see me with his feathers all up and his voice a-crackin', and told me he was letting Mr. Woodbury go.
9283	Carla	Oh, did he?
9284	Dr. Kelso	Yup. And his knees were knocking so loud, I almost didn't see you standing above him, pulling the strings.
9285	Carla	Look, Dr. Kelso, all
9286	Dr. Kelso	Ah, maybe Mr. Woodbury will be fine. Maybe he'll be back here in a few days even worse for wear because you rushed him out. Who knows? But, darn it all, though, if what I don't think is the bigger question, is why you even give a hoot?
9287	Carla	Well, actually, sir, I have this little problem with caring for my patients.
9288	Dr. Kelso	Still, if you decide later that what you really care about is how much your patients like you, you can always change your mind about letting Mr. Woodbury leave. Hell, I'll even back you up.
9289	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9290	Turk	Apologize.
9291	J.D.	Apologize to you?
9292	Turk	No. To Richard that was his basketball.
9293	J.D.	Hello, Richard. I'll tell you what: Tomorrow, at lunch, I'll I'll I'll bring you a new basketball.... And a hoagie.
9294	Turk	What's up? This is about Elliot? Don't you want to hear my side of the story with your little sex buddy?
9295	J.D.	No.
9296	Turk	Come on, man, where's the love? Where's the where's the loyalty? Where's the automatically siding with the person you care about the most?Oh, my God, that's what you're doing, isn't it. Isn't it?
9297	J.D.'s Narration	Some realizations stop you in your tracks. Others can lead you in new directions.
9298	Elliot	Dr. Cox. I just wanted to let you know that Turk did the right thing by taking my patients off of my service.
9299	Dr. Cox	Noooo. What that yellow-bellied scalpel jock should have done was to go down to Surgery and schedule himself for an early morning add-a-pair-tomy. That way, if it took, he'd have the stones to at least come and talk to you next time he had a problem.
9300	Elliot	I just can't seem to stop letting my life out there affect my life in here, you know?
9301	Dr. Cox	Well, hell, Barbie...look at me. It's not like I've always been the centered, well-adjusted guy-smiley you see walking up and down the halls of this dump; I mean, stuff like that takes time. But, eventually, you learn to keep your personal problems separate from this place.
9302	Elliot	So, what do I do until then?
9303	Dr. Cox	You get your damn life in order.Oh, and, Barbie? Let's say word were to get out that Uncle Cox was doling out the feel goods? I'll make ya pay ya have no idea. Huge!
9304	J.D.'s Narration	It's a funny thing when we're forced to see ourselves in a new light.
9305	Carla	Mr. Woodbury! Hold on a sec!
9306	J.D.'s Narration	Hopefully, you see yourself in time to make a change.
9307	Carla	Unfortunately, we're not comfortable discharging you just yet. I'm really, really sorry.
9308	J.D.'s Narration	And hopefully you'll be respected for it.
9309	Mr. Woodbury	You evil little witch!
9310	Dr. Kelso	Let me see that chart, Nurse!Well! I see no reason we should keep Mr. Woodbury any longer! Enjoy your son's wedding, sir! Cherish the moment!
9311	Mr. Woodbury	Thank you so much, Dr.....?
9312	Dr. Kelso	Kelso! Bob Kelso!
9313	Mr. Woodbury	Bye, Bob!
9314	Dr. Kelso	Glad I could help.
9315	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, sometimes, the new light opens your eyes to something you've known in your heart all along.
9316	Elliot	It just feels like every day keeps getting worse.
9317	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9318	Elliot	What's all this?
9319	J.D.	Nothing.... I just felt like taking care of you.
9320	Elliot	That is so nice!
9321	J.D.'s Thoughts	It's nice because it's the beginning of something.
9322	Elliot	I.... I can't do this.
9323	J.D.	Okay, less tongue, less tongue.
9324	Elliot	No, this. You know sex buddies.J.D., Dr. Cox and I were talking, and my life is just so scattered right now. And I just...I just can't seem to grab a toe-hold, you know? And...I know myself, and if we keep doing this, I'm not gonna be able to separate the sex from my feelings. And we'll just end up being a couple again. And...neither one of us wants that, right?I mean, I know I don't.
9325	J.D.	Me neither.
9326	Elliot	So, what do we do?
9327	J.D.	Uh.... It's it's no big deal. You you get your stuff out of my room, and you crash on the couch.
9328	Elliot	'Kay.

9330	Turk	Where the hell is Carla, man? We're gonna miss the previews!
9331	J.D.	Hey, you're black, right?
9332	Turk	Here we go.
9333	J.D.	I hate that stereotype that all black people yell at movie screens. You know? Like, you go see some horror flick, and you be yelling, like, "Don't go in there, girl, he behind the doh'!" You know? It's like...it's offensive.
9334	Turk	You wish you were allowed to yell at the screen, don't you!
9335	J.D.	Why does she go in there!? I mean, he's behind the doh'!
9336	J.D.'s Narration	It's weird to run into someone from the hospital out in the real world.
9337	J.D.	Oh, hey, Dr. Kelso.
9338	Turk	How...how ya doin', sir?
9339	Dr. Kelso	I'm just Jim Dandy. Now, unless your pants are made out of Turtle Wax, I suggest you boys get your asses off of Bessy.
9340	J.D.	Oh, I'm sorr You named your car, huh?
9341	J.D.'s Narration	Ultimately, life is a lot simpler at home.Unless you live with a co-worker you're crazy about, and she recently decided she can't handle sleeping with you, and she just wants to be friends.
9342	Elliot	Oh...right. Morning, buddy!
9343	J.D.	Morning, pal.
9344	Elliot	I'll just go get dressed...and then, uh, we can go to work.
9345	J.D.'s Thoughts	All right, just relax. You can totally handle this.
9346	J.D.	Chop Chop-chop, buddy!
9347	Elliot	Told you I could fit in this spot!
9348	J.D.	You were right. I'll just...put this guy's side-view mirror on his roof.Argh.
9349	Elliot	Hey, J.D.
9350	J.D.	Ooh!Yes?
9351	Elliot	I wanted to say something, you know, before we go back in there.
9352	J.D.	G'head.
9353	Elliot	That I understand that it's gonna be a little bit harder for you to transition into being just friends again.
9354	J.D.	Why?
9355	Elliot	Because...you're a guy?
9356	J.D.	What does that have to do with anything?
9357	Elliot	You're right. You know what we should do? Everything I own is in the back of this truck including my bed. We should just get in there, get naked, and have sex one last time just get it out of our system.J.D., I was kidding to prove a point.

9363	J.D.	I don't feel weird.
9364	Nurse Roberts	_I_ feel weird.
9365	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, just tell her the truth you're crazy about her.
9366	J.D.	Look, Elliot
9367	Dr. Cox	Ahhh, damn. I missed the annual sleep-over, didn't I? That _wonderful_ time of year when you two crazy kids throw caution to the wind and make sweet, elbowy love to each other. Don't you be shy! You can tell Uncle Coxie about the naught-aye!
9368	Elliot	Dr. Cox, I lost my apartment, and so I was just...needing a place to stay.
9369	Dr. Cox	So, you went over to your "friend's" house, and cried on his shoulder boo-hoo, wah and you, of course, comforted her because she was weak and vulnerable, and blah...blah...blah...nerdy sex. The end. Dear Lord, Laverne, how in God's name do you listen to this crap all day long?
9370	Nurse Roberts	Are you kidding? If he turns out to be her brother, this is better than my stories!
9371	Dr. Cox	Oh, you are _so_ right!
9372	Todd	Dude. What are her boobs like?
9373	Elliot	Todd, I'm standing right here.
9374	Todd	I'm sorry. What are your boobs like?
9375	Dr. Cox	Oh, joy of joys Mr. Corman, you've joined us yet again. And what imaginary disease is ailing you this time, my good man?
9376	Carla	This time he thinks he has the Yaba virus.
9377	Mr. Corman	Your hair got longer.... And I don't appreciate your tone.
9378	Dr. Cox	Last month, you thought you had familial Mediterranean fever.
9379	Mr. Corman	I was at my friend Kelly Papadopoulos' wedding, okay? I share a glass of ouzo with this guy named Yanos. Twenty minutes later, I'm in a cab, I gotta ask the guy to pull over because I'm gonna explode in some guy's rose garden! Now, what would _you_ think!?
9380	Dr. Cox	Same thing I think right now: That you got yourself a bad case of the wish-you-were-sicks.
9381	Mr. Corman	Yeah, well I read the symptoms on the internet, okay? I have Yaba!
9382	Dr. Cox	Would you say you've been in contact with many exotic primates this year?
9383	Mr. Corman	I have been to the zoo, yes.
9384	Dr. Cox	And, while you were there, did you go ahead and jump right into the cage and play toss the poop with the other monkeys? Because, if you did, then yeah, you just might have Yaba. But, if that's the case, it would be way, way down on the list of your problems.Give him a full work-up.
9385	Carla	Okay, Mr. Corman, you know the drill.
9386	Mr. Corman	Here are my vitals.
9387	Carla	Mm-hmm.
9388	Mr. Corman	Here is the Mountain Dew I'm just kidding, that's my urine sample. And you can start timing......now. So, how you been doing? Still seeing that surgeon?
9389	Carla	No talking.

9393	Turk	Brain!
9394	Dr. Kelso	...brain.
9395	Turk	Mrs. Kay is doing great, sir. But, after this type of procedure, most people experience a diminished reaction time.
9396	Mrs. Kay	Christopher, come here.
9397	Turk	Hm?
9398	Mrs. Kay	Maybe you should worry about your _own_ reaction time.
9399	Dr. Kelso	Now, do you have a ride home today, dear?
9400	Mrs. Kay	I drove myself.
9401	Dr. Kelso	Well, it always warms my heart to see your face.I don't care what the old bat says I doubt she can back out of her own driveway. Tell her you're calling the DMV and having her license revoked immediately.
9402	Turk	Why don't you tell her yourself, sir?
9403	Dr. Kelso	'Cause she's my friend! Don't be insensitive, son, it's ugly on you.
9404	Turk	You guys, I can't take this sweet old lady's driver's license from her she reminds me of my Gram-Gram.
9405	J.D.	Why don't you just get someone else from Surgery to do it?
9406	Turk	Like who?
9407	Todd	Gimme it!You want this? You want this?Psych!
9408	J.D.	Nevermind.
9409	Lisa	Hey, J.D.
9410	J.D.	Oh, hey, Lisa.
9411	Turk	Dude. With gift shop chick...did you ever 'ehn-ehn!'?
9412	Carla	Turk! Elliot's right here!
9413	Elliot	Why would I care?
9414	Carla	I'm sorry. I guess, when I was passing by J.D.'s room the other night, he was telling a _different_ Dr. Reid not to stop.
9415	Turk	"Ohh! Dr. Reid!" Sweet!
9416	J.D.	You guys, this conversation is starting to make me feel a little uncomfortable, okay? And I'm sure "Dr. Reid" feels the same way.
9417	Elliot	No I don't. You can "ehn-ehn" with anyone that you want.
9418	J.D.'s Thoughts	So, she wants to play Chicken, huh? Well, buckle up, missy!
9419	J.D.	Well, maybe I'll just ask Lisa out again.
9420	Elliot	You should.
9421	J.D.	Maybe I will!
9422	Elliot	Cool.
9423	J.D.	Good.
9424	Elliot	Take it home.
9425	J.D.	That's what I'll do.
9426	Elliot	Let me know how it goes.
9427	Lisa	Fine. But I am taking my own car so I can escape in case you turn into a freak again.
9428	J.D.	It's a date!
9429	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9430	Dr. Cox	It's just that the guy's here like a thousand times a year, taking up a bed. And every second I'm in there with him, it's time away from somebody I could actually help.
9431	Carla	Well, what do you want me to do about it?
9432	Dr. Cox	Follow my lead.Alas, Mr. Corman, shockingly, all your labs have come back and they're negative for...everything.
9433	Mr. Corman	Aw, come on!
9434	Dr. Cox	Okay, I'll tell you what: You have suggested that you're feeling rather tired lately, haven't you.
9435	Mr. Corman	I'm listening.
9436	Dr. Cox	And that you bruise easily?
9437	Mr. Corman	Like an old banana.
9438	Dr. Cox	For the record, I think you're fine. But, if you'd like, we can go ahead and check out your bone marrow. Of course, that would mean sticking an enormous needle all the way through your hip and it's very, very, very, very excruciatingly painful. Right, Carla?
9439	Carla	Yes.
9440	Dr. Cox	Thank you, Carla. Now, what's it gonna be, there, champ? Head home and get some rest, or an afternoon of senseless, mind-numbing..._agony_?
9441	Mr. Corman	Eh, what the hell. I'll take the giant hip needle.
9442	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9443	J.D.'s Thoughts	All right, there's no one around. Time to tell her how you really feel.
9444	J.D.	You know, Elliot....
9445	Todd	What's up, Medical Dogs!
9446	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, you're smarter than him. Think of something clever to get him out of here.
9447	J.D.	Hey, Todd.
9448	Todd	What the hell? Did you just throw something out into the hall?
9449	J.D.	So, anyway, Elliot....
9450	Elliot	Hey, I found an apartment!
9451	J.D.	Great! ...You know, but there's no rush for you to move out.
9452	Elliot	Well, what are we gonna do, just live with each other forever, and anytime we feel, like, lonely or vulnerable, we just hop into bed and have hot sex?
9453	J.D.	That would be stupid.
9454	Elliot	We're both human, so, staying in that situation would be a big mistake.
9455	J.D.	I know.

9457	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes when you're down, you end up taking it out on the wrong person.
9458	J.D.	Going on vacation?
9459	Janitor	I get it 'cause I'm a janitor, so, when I pack for a vacation, I just pack cleaning supplies. That's funny!
9460	J.D.	I thought so.
9461	Janitor	Actually, I'm going to speak at my son's career day.
9462	J.D.	About...being a janitor?
9463	Janitor	What do you think, there aren't kids out there that want to grow up to make the world sparkle?
9464	J.D.	I I didn't mean it that way, I just....

9469	Turk	Dr. Kelso, will you just hear me out? All I'm saying is that Mrs. Kay looks like she's in great shape!
9470	Dr. Kelso	My God, son, the woman is recovering from major surgery on her....
9471	Turk	Brain!
9472	Dr. Kelso	Dammit. Why do I keep blanking on that? Now, son, give me the real skinny did you pull her license or not?
9473	Turk	Yes, sir, I did.AGH!Okay...I didn't tell her yet, sir. But I swear I was gonna!

9475	Dr. Cox	Well, Mr. Corman, how'd that go for ya?
9476	Mr. Corman	Horrible pain. I made sounds like a dolphin giving birth.
9477	Carla	Dr. Cox, I think you should take a look at, um, Mr. Corman's chart.
9478	Dr. Cox	Why, what's he got, scurvy? Mr. Corman? There's no chance you were on a ship in the 1700s, is there?
9479	Carla	Just look at the damn chart.
9480	Mr. Corman	What is it?
9481	Dr. Cox	You're sick.
9482	Mr. Corman	Really?
9483	Dr. Cox	Yeah.
9484	Mr. Corman	Oh.

9486	J.D.'s Narration	I feel like, if I could get out of this place, and get away from Elliot for a while, I could regroup...you know. But, sometimes, that's not so easy.
9487	Elliot	My truck was right there.
9488	J.D.	Where is it now?
9489	Elliot	You have to ask the guy who stole it. Everything I own was in that truck.J.D., I don't know what I'm gonna do!
9490	J.D.	Wow.Gotta go. Good luck.Tally-ho!

9492	Turk	Dude, she was going like thirty-five miles an hour. All you saw was, like, knuckles and a bun.Poor Bessy, man.
9493	J.D.	What kind of grown man still names his car?
9494	Turk	You do.
9495	J.D.	Yeah, well, I've had Malik since I was seventeen; that's totally different. Don't worry about Kelso, his wife can drive him.

9498	Dr. Cox	Mr. Corman, I'm afraid you have Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia. It is a very rare form of...of cancer.
9499	Mr. Corman	Yeah.... I think I had that in college once.
9500	Dr. Cox	This is Dr. Zeltzer. He is the finest oncologist we have on staff.
9501	Dr. Zeltzer	Really? You think so?
9502	Dr. Cox	Yeah, I do.
9503	Dr. Zeltzer	Thank you!
9504	Mr. Corman	So, where do we start?
9505	Dr. Zeltzer	Well, uh, first off, we need to Better than Leventhal?
9506	Mr. Corman	Leventhal's a quack. You're the guy. You're the man. You can do it!
9507	Dr. Zeltzer	Bless you.That was some catch. The patient shows almost no symptoms, you call for a bone marrow biopsy? What made you even think to do that?
9508	Dr. Cox	How about, he was unbelievably annoying, and I wanted to scare him so bad that he'd never come back in my hospital again?
9509	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9510	Carla	Oh! Don't worry, Dr. Zeltzer, he's only kidding!
9511	Dr. Zeltzer	Stupid! See, that's where Leventhal has the edge he woulda got that; the man is hilarious. Well, of course, he wouldn't be laughing so hard if he knew I was sleeping with his wife.

9516	J.D.	Then what's with the look?
9517	Elliot	Oh, I have a crick in my neck. See, uh, since I no longer have any furniture for my new place, I had to sleep in my tub last night. Oh, how was your date?

9519	J.D.	Italian people are really good at making sauce.

9521	J.D.	Fantastic!
9522	Elliot	You're such an ass.
9523	Nurse Roberts	Could you speak up? Mr. Roberts doesn't hear so well.
9524	Elliot	Laverne, if you're looking for your beeswax, none of that is over here, okay?!
9525	Nurse Roberts	Now she all mad.
9526	Elliot	Look, I really just needed your help last night, and you completely bailed on me.
9527	J.D.	You're the one that drew all these lines up, said that we're not in a relationship right now.
9528	Elliot	J.D., I wasn't looking for a boyfriend last night I was looking for a friend.
9529	Nurse Roberts	Guess she told him.Gotta go.
9530	J.D.	Ow.
9531	Janitor	I was just thinkin' about what you said, and, uh, you're right buncha kids don't want to hear about being a janitor.
9532	J.D.	I never said that.
9533	Janitor	It's okay. 'Cause, instead, I'm gonna be a doctor. I borrowed some stuff from your locker _our_ locker and, um...listen, if I don't get it back to you within, like, two days...consider it gone.

9535	Turk	Dr. Kelso, I am so sorry. It's just, Mrs. Kay told me about picking up her grand-kids, and she said she was feeling fine, and I believed her.
9536	Dr. Kelso	Doctor, follow me.Son, have you used drugs in the last forty-eight hours?
9537	Patient	Oh, no, sir. Never use drugs.
9538	Dr. Kelso	Because this shot you're about to get could kill you if it's mixed with narcotics.
9539	Patient	Oh, drugs! Yes, sir, all the time!
9540	Dr. Kelso	See? Waiting for the tox-screen six hours. Frightening the bejeebies out of the local riff-raff ten seconds. Everybody lies, Dr. Turk. Whether it's that doobie brother in there, or, say, me when I tell my son he can still live at the house after he graduates from art school. And, by the way, sport: Mrs. Kay doesn't _have_ any grandchildren.
9541	Girl	I'm still a virgin.
9542	Turk	You're pregnant.
9543	Girl	Again!?
9544	Man	Since the bypass, doc, nothin' but salads.

9549	Mr. Corman	That's great.
9550	Dr. Cox	Yeah, it is!
9551	Mr. Corman	But you know what? You guys can pat yourself on the back all you want, but I'm not an idiot. I know that you were screwing with me; that I come in here sometimes, thinking I'm sick when I'm not. But if you remember anything, you remember this: If it turns out I didn't have cancer, I coulda been just some guy coming in here, looking for help...that you treated like crap.
9552	Dr. Cox	Yeah.
9553	Mr. Corman	The whole thing has given me an ulcer.

9566	Dr. Cox	Why did you let me harass that guy?
9567	Carla	So, you think the fact that you got annoyed and became incredibly insensitive with another human being is _my_ fault?
9568	Dr. Cox	Sh'yeah! Lookit, whenever I'm about to do some stupid-ass stuff, you're the one who calls me on it, and you're then damn-sure the one who makes me stop. That's the way it works. That's the way it's worked for years, and.... Just exactly what happened to that?
9569	Carla	I guess I just don't get as good a read on you as I used to. ...Maybe all that therapy _has_ changed you?
9570	Dr. Cox	Oh, please, I'm crazier than ever. Lookit, during this entire conversation, I've actually been imagining myself sitting on a throne between us, watching all of this.
9571	Carla	Maybe we're just not as close as we used to be.
9572	Dr. Cox	Maybe.
9573	Carla	So, you're just, like, right here, watching us?
9574	Dr. Cox	No.... Other side.M'yeah.I'm...invisible to the naked eye.

9581	J.D.	It is not.
9582	Janitor	Well, if the cut was that deep, I'd probably just, uh, pull your arm off.Once again: _Doctor_..._Jan_ _Itor_. Dr. Jan Itor.
9583	J.D.	Okay, maybe you're right. But, we're doctors, man. I mean, that comes with the territory; some patients just don't like telling the whole truth.
9584	Turk	Well, I don't get why people have to do that.
9585	J.D.	I don't know.... Maybe it's 'cause they're proud...maybe it's 'cause they're scared....
9586	Elliot	You know what, it was just stuff! I'm fine.
9587	J.D.	Maybe it's because telling the truth would make them feel too vulnerable.
9588	Turk	I guess. Dude, you're gonna be late for Gift Shop Girl.
9589	J.D.	Oh, my God!
9590	J.D.'s Narration	There are a few things I've always believed in....Flowers are good for any occasion.And nothing is more important than making time for an old friend.Especially if the old girl's seen better days.'Cause even if it breaks your heart to be 'just friends', if you really care about someone, you'll take the hit.

9598	Turk	Positive.
9599	J.D.	Congratulations! So, when are you gonna ask her?
9600	Turk	Tonight I'm gonna make her a nice dinner, then I'm gonna put the ring in her champagne glass.
9601	J.D.	You might as well put it in her cham-lame glass.
9602	Turk	Okay, Mr. Know-It-All, what would you do?
9603	J.D.	Okay, first you gotta get, like, fifty candles, right?
9604	Turk	Mm-hmm?
9605	J.D.	You spread 'em all over the room with some rose petals....
9606	Turk	That's right, because the roses are beautiful, and they make the room smell amazing.

9644	J.D.	You are naughty!
9645	Elaine	Ugh. You know, it always feels so weird to be sitting around hoping someone's family pulls them off life support.
9646	J.D.	I honestly believe, in hospitals...there's like this...balance. You know? It's like, when one person dies, another person gets a chance to live. I like to call it The Circle of Life.

9692	Mr. Larkin	Ah, here it comes.
9693	Dr. Cox	The thing is that pregnancy puts such an extra strain on your heart that, had we known about this condition beforehand, we would have strongly suggested you think twice about even getting pregnant before getting the valve repaired.
9694	Mrs. Larkin	I would've done it anyways!
9695	Dr. Cox	Yeah, you would've. You got a healthy supply of pluck about you, don't ya.

9727	Lawyer	Sir, I'm so happy for you I could crap.
9728	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes, words come easy.
9729	Elliot	Dr. Kelso, I _demand_ a female locker room.
9730	Carla	I loved it, but, why spend all this money on this fancy dinner?
9731	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes, the words don't come out at all.
9732	Turk	No reason.
9733	J.D.'s Narration	But, ultimately, you have to grit your teeth and just say it.
9734	Dr. Cox	We don't deliver this baby, your wife could die.
9735	J.D.'s Narration	You see, as a doctor, you get used to the whole balance in the hospital thing. You know, when one person lives, another dies, and how it always seems to even out...
9736	Mr. Larkin	But it's so soon! You said so, yourself. What's gonna happen to the baby?
9737	Dr. Cox	We're gonna do our best.
9738	J.D.'s Narration	...but it never seems fair when it happens in the same family.
9739	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9740	Mr. Larkin	So, you're telling me if we don't deliver the baby now, my wife could die. And if we do, our child probably won't live.
9741	J.D.'s Thoughts	Sometimes, as a doctor, I wish my life was more like my favorite TV show.
9742	J.D.	Oh, come on, death isn't that bad. Especially if you're dying from laughter you're on 'Candid Camera'!
9743	Mr. Larkin	No, I'm not!Honey no!
9744	Dr. Cox	Oh, I'll give you "honey, no"s! Come on out here!
9745	Mr. Larkin	Where are the cameras?!
9746	J.D.	We got ya! A camera there, there, and there!
9747	Dr. Cox	Mr. Larkin, we need a decision from you, here.
9748	Mr. Larkin	I'm not ready to do this.
9749	Dr. Cox	You go, I'll cover her.
9750	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9751	Elliot	Dr. Kelso, I am not leaving here until I get an answer.
9752	Dr. Kelso	Sweetheart, there are lots of people who think the hospital would be a better place if we made some changes. Take Ted, for instance!
9753	Lawyer	Uhh.... I feel I'd be more productive if my phone dialed out.
9754	Dr. Kelso	This hospital has always had a co-ed locker room. Ahhh, back when I was a resident, I remember blah-blah-blah, nostalgic story. Now get the hell out of my office!Not you, Ted.Ted, get the hell out of my office!
9755	Lawyer	Oh, thank God.
9756	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9757	Turk	I'm gonna miss you so much.
9758	Carla	I'm only going to Chicago for five days. I'll call you when I land.See ya.
9759	Turk	Baby, don't go.
9760	J.D.	Have you seen Mr. Larkin?
9761	Carla	Uh, no.
9762	Janitor	Thanks for the pen.
9763	J.D.	Oh, no.
9764	Janitor	Yeah.That's my favorite t-shirt.And this...my favorite skin!
9765	J.D.	Well, you know that I would never mean for that to happen. You know that, right?
9766	Janitor	Yeah! I know that.
9767	J.D.	Okay, this is a little cozy for me.
9768	Janitor	Is it?
9769	Mr. Larkin	I don't think you people are getting how difficult this is.
9770	J.D.	Trust me, I wouldn't want to have to make this decision.
9771	Mr. Larkin	I wish I could ask my wife. She'd be better at handling this than me.
9772	J.D.	You know, you and I are a lot alike. We may seem like the kind of guy you can just, you know, throw in a head-lock and draw a mustache on...but, in crunch time, we always come through.It's time. Come on.
9773	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9774	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Reid, are you off for the day?
9775	Elliot	Oh! I just didn't have a place to change....
9776	Nurse Roberts	Mm-hmm.
9777	Dr. Kelso	Laverne, I'm going to pretend you're not wearing that.
9778	Nurse Roberts	Don't you usually wait 'till you get home before you do that?
9779	Elliot	Plus, according to county statue, all medical facilities in this region are required to provide single-sex bathrooms and change-rooms for their employees. Put that in your suggestion box and smoke it!
9780	Dr. Kelso	Dammit. Where'd she learn all that legal mumbo-jumbo?What are you doing, Ted!?
9781	Lawyer	I'm trying to whistle...? You know, so you wouldn't think it was me.
9782	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9783	Turk	Stop the cab! Whoa! Hey! Open the door! Baby, open the door! Open the damn door!
9784	Carla	Turk! What are you doing?
9785	Old Lady	Take it.
9786	Turk	Sorry, ma'am. My bad.
9787	Carla	What is going on?
9788	Turk	I gotta ask you something before you go.
9789	Carla	What?
9790	Mr. Larkin	You're doing great. You're gonna be fine.
9791	Dr. Cox	Nice job, Newbie. That's a real nice job. What we gotta do now is cross our fingers.
9792	J.D.'s Narration	Death is always hanging around this hospital.
9793	Death	Morning.
9794	J.D.'s Narration	Ultimately, it all boils down to what your attitude is about it.
9795	Elaine	I'm not afraid of death. I mean, if I got a heart, that would be great. Still, if they told me it was never gonna happen, I think that'd be okay, too. It's the _waiting_ I can't take. I just wanna know one way or the other, you know?
9796	Dr. Cox	I got an idea: Why don't we switch to a cheerier subject!
9797	J.D.	What do you think death is like?
9798	Elaine	I really hope it's like a big Broadway musical. Everyone's all dressed up and singing to the rafters, and you go out with a real flourish.
9799	J.D.	I think it's like a game of dodge-ball.There's a lot of chaos and screaming, and...you know...eventually you get your glasses snapped in half by the big kid who already has underarm hair. But then you wake up in the hot nurse's office, and when she leans in to put that bandage on your nose, you get a sense that something could actually happen if you just took a chance and buried your face in her knockers.
9800	Dr. Cox	Holy cow. I'm so sorry. I guess, for my part, I think death is a lot like that story, quite frankly. But, if there is a God, it'll be a lot quicker and half as painful.
9801	Elaine	It's fun to annoy him!
9802	J.D.	It's what I do.
9803	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9804	Lawyer	So, I hear they're making that office into the ladies' locker room, huh?
9805	Dr. Kelso	Yes, Ted.
9806	Lawyer	Bummer!We hey, maybe whoever's over here might not stay there forever!
9807	Doctor	Well, I'm here doing a research fellowship, so I'll be anywhere from fifteen to twenty-five years!
9808	Lawyer	That's a long time.
9809	Doctor	Yeah!
9810	Lawyer	You'll probably be dead!
9811	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9812	Turk	So, um, we've known each other for, like, a year and a half, right?
9813	Carla	Turk. That's my ride.
9814	Turk	Yeah, I know, just give me a second. Just give me a second, okay? I've been thinking a lot lately.I'm talkin' here!
9815	Carla	Turk, I'm I'm gonna miss my flight. I gotta go, Honey, I'm sorry.
9816	Turk	Will you marry me?
9817	Carla	What did you say?
9818	Turk	I think I said, Will you marry me?
9819	Carla	Turk, wow!
9820	Turk	I got a ring. Um.... I don't have it on me, but, uh...it's in a safe place.
9821	Carla	I can't believe this! I I've imagined you saying this to me like a thousand times.... I just never imagined that when you actually asked, all I would say is...I need to think.
9822	Turk	Cool! Uh.... Yeah, whew! That's that's that's that's what I was hoping to hear!
9823	Carla	I love you. I really do.
9824	Turk	Love you, too.

9828	J.D.	Congratulations, you guys. He's doing great.
9829	J.D.'s Thoughts	I guess sometimes my whole theory about life and death balancing each other out in the hospital doesn't hold true. I guess sometimes you get lucky.

9848	J.D.'s Narration	It's not every day your best bud asks his girlfriend to marry him.
9849	J.D.	Hey, Chocolate Bear! Did you ask her?
9850	Turk	She said she needed to think about it, then she hopped on a plane to Chicago for five days.
9851	J.D.'s Thoughts	He needs you. Stay positive.
9852	J.D.	Woo-hooooo! She's thinkin', she's thinkin', and we should go out drinkin'! chicka uh-huh chicka-chicka.... Wanna get a beer?
9853	Turk	I'm not leaving this spot until she calls.
9854	J.D.	All right, man. I understand.Still nothing?!
9855	Turk	We just keep missing each other. I'm not sweating it.She asked me to pick her up from the airport! That's a good sign, right!
9856	J.D.	Good sign? Dude, I am so sure Carla's gonna say yes, if she doesn't I'll power-walk naked through these halls singing "Me and Bobby McGee"!
9857	Dr. Kelso	Ahhh, Janis Joplin! My God, she was an uggo! No offense, sport uh, don't think I have anything against ugly people.
9858	J.D.	Why would I take offense to that?
9859	Dr. Kelso	No reason. Anyway, I see you're on the nephrology service for Dr. Townshend this month!
9860	J.D.'s Narration	Dr. Townshend is like the Anti-Kelso.
9861	Staffer	Hey, Doc!
9862	J.D.'s Narration	The nurses love him...
9863	Dr. Townshend	Betty! That color is great on you!
9864	J.D.'s Narration	The attendings love him....
9865	Dr. Townshend	Hey! How's the best doctor in this hospital?
9866	Dr. Cox	You tell me, hot-shot!
9867	J.D.'s Narration	Everyone loves him.
9868	Ted's Band	"...Hello, my honey / Hello, my rag-time, summer-time gal!"
9869	Dr. Townshend	"Send me a kiss by wire!"

9873	J.D.'s Narration	Everyone.
9874	Janitor	Thank you. For being you.
9875	J.D.'s Narration	And the weirdest thing of all is that he and Dr. Kelso are best friends.
9876	Dr. Kelso	There he is!
9877	Dr. Townshend	Missed you on our morning jog, Bobby. What is that now, about two hundred days in a row?
9878	Dr. Kelso	You're a pistol!
9879	J.D.	The only place this guy's running to is to a bakery! Who's got me up high?
9880	Dr. Kelso	Ehhh.

9886	Carla	I want to thank you for not pressuring me. I mean, don't get me wrong, you left me like forty messages in five days; but...I know you if you weren't holding back, it woulda been like a hundred and forty.
9887	Turk	I do love the speed dial!So, you got an answer yet?
9888	Dr. Cox	What's the deal, there, Gandhi? Are you gonna be a bride?Ohhhh, come on. This is one of those very small windows when I'm borderline interested in your life. So, what's the deal? Did she give you an answer?
9889	Turk	Not yet.
9890	J.D.	Thanks, Todd. Here's that fifty bucks I promised you.
9891	Todd	Keep it, man. That was for me!

9898	Turk	I'm not really proud of this, but I can pick your puff-'n'-stuff out of a line-up.
9899	J.D.	Oh, it changed since you saw it it got a haircut.
9900	Turk	Yeah.
9901	J.D.'s Narration	Turk's brother is staying with us for the weekend.

9909	Turk	This, right here, is fit for a king.
9910	Kevin	Well, that's good. That makes me feel better about sleeping in your room while you're comfy out here.
9911	Turk	No, Kevin, that's not gonna work.
9912	Kevin	Well, I'm a business man we can work something out. Let me see, I sent you to college, and med school, and you have done nothing for me; so, I tell you what: I'll sleep on the couch, and you cut me a check for eighty grand.
9913	Turk	I'll go get my pillow.
9914	Kevin	Yeah.
9915	J.D.	That was good, Kevin! We should we should make him, like, make dinner for us tonight. He could be our own personal slave!
9916	Kevin	Our own personal _what_, now?
9917	J.D.	Oh, no, I don I don't mean like _that_ kind of slave.
9918	Kevin	Well, how 'bout this: How 'bout he be the house slave, and I be the field slave. That sound like fun to you?
9919	J.D.	That that wouldn't be fun....

9925	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes Elliot just can't help herself.

9927	Dr. Cox	Hark, it is the high-pitched warble of the nosy nelly! Don't see many of those flitting about these halls anymore because, well, quite frankly, when one does one shoots to kill.Now, Bar-bie, Jordan is here for her ultrasound today, and I'm going to be holding her claw the entire time. So, what you've just done is essentially volunteered to do all of your work and all of mine. And if you'll step right this way, I'll be more than glad to tell you more about what you've won!
9928	Dr. Townshend	See you at lunch, Bobby?
9929	Dr. Kelso	Split-pea soup today!
9930	Dr. Townshend	Oh!
9931	J.D.	You know, sir, Dr. Townshend, here, was telling me you have some great old stories about the hospital. I...I'd love to hear one sometime.
9932	Dr. Kelso	Well, what the hell. Back in '68...I don't like you. The end.

9938	J.D.	Please!
9939	J.D.'s Thoughts	She's psychic!
9940	Carla	I just wanna have a nice lunch with my boyfriend and his brother, okay?
9941	J.D.'s Narration	What Carla didn't know was that Turk was using his brother as a selling point. Because no one said "family" more than Kevin Turk.

9960	Jordan	No, we're not.
9961	Dr. Cox	Jordan, be reasonable. If you're incubating some kind of man-bat in there, we should find out about it as soon as possible there are vaccinations to consider.
9962	Jordan	Tell you what, we'll compromise. I'll decide this, and you get to decide...um.... Sorry, I got nothing.
9963	Dr. Gerson	Look, it's common for each parent to feel differently.
9964	Dr. Cox	Actually, I am not the father; he's a bell-boy in Greece.
9965	Jordan	We think.
9966	Dr. Gerson	Neat.

9974	J.D.	I don't know, either!
9975	Dr. Townshend	Well, if it isn't my favorite custodial engineer! Listen, do me a favor, will you?
9976	Janitor	Yeah?
9977	Dr. Townshend	Help me look after this kid one of the good guys.
9978	Kevin	So, look, Chris, I got a meeting this afternoon...but what do you say tonight, me and you tear it up like we used to!
9979	Turk	I gotta work.
9980	Kevin	Well, get somebody to cover for your ass, man! I'm only here for the weekend!
9981	Turk	Look, I _just_ asked Carla to marry me, and you were in there acting like a jerk.
9982	Kevin	Oh, man! You you you're engaged!? Congratulations!
9983	Turk	She hasn't exactly said yes yet.
9984	Kevin	Well, that that that that's all right. Sometimes a lady just needs to sleep on it.
9985	Turk	I asked her a week ago.
9986	Kevin	Damn!
9987	Turk	Yeah.
9988	Kevin	Well, on the bright side, you are definitely flying solo tonight, huh!

10004	Dr. Townshend	Now, Mr. Singer, here, needs a swan. So, why don't you go ahead and do an IJ cut down?
10005	J.D.'s Thoughts	A _cut down_? No one does those anymore.
10006	J.D.	Uh, sir, shouldn't I just do a modified Seldinger? I mean, it's so much safer.
10007	Dr. Townshend	Nah, come on, let's do "old school."
10008	J.D.	But, sir, I don't
10009	Dr. Townshend	Grab a scalpel; I'll get the kit.Somebody?

10021	Dr. Townshend	No one expects you to, son.
10022	Todd	Okay, thanks.
10023	J.D.'s Thoughts	All right, this sucks. But, as bad as I feel, I'm sure Dr. Townshend feels even worse for making me do the procedure.
10024	Dr. Townshend	Don't worry about it I'll take the blame, okay?

10027	Carla	Do you really think he wants to get married?
10028	Dr. Cox	Listen, any guy who'd be willing to scour the face of the earth to find the world's smallest diamond ring clearly knows just exactly what he wants.
10029	Carla	I just don't know if he's mature enough. I mean, he couldn't stop giggling when he found out he had to operate on Mr. Wiener.
10030	Dr. Cox	It's a funny name!
10031	Carla	Stop it.
10032	Dr. Cox	Look: The guy's twenty-seven years old, he's a surgeon currently involved in a long-term monogamous relationship; and as much as I'd love to trash him, I'm afraid I'm not down with the whole maturity thing.Barbie!Barbie, lookit, I need you to go down to the lab and get Mrs. Miller's blood-work; I also need you to disimpact Mr. Burnett in 317; and what did you say the sex of the child was?
10033	Elliot	I've got a better idea: You do those things, and when you're done, I'll think about telling you the sex.
10034	Dr. Cox	Huh, that's weird. It seems like you just went to a swap meet and got yourself a big-boy spine. Now, listen, you tell or else!
10035	Elliot	Or else what? You'll treat me worse than you usually do? Here's the inside scoop, Perry: For the first time, I have leverage. You're familiar with leverage, right? It's what you're going to need when you disimpact Mr. Burnett who, by the way, is so locked up, I'm guessing he's been eating either gum, rubber cement, or cork.
10036	Dr. Cox	Look. Barbie.
10037	Elliot	Yeah...that's not my name.
10038	Dr. Cox	Fine.... Dr......Reid? Really?
10039	Elliot	What?
10040	Dr. Cox	Nothing.
10041	Elliot	Elliot Reid in the house!

10043	Janitor	Sit.
10044	J.D.	Oh, no thanks... I'll just go
10045	Janitor	I'm not asking.All right, guys, this is the kid I was telling you about we're gonna look out for.This is Brent from Parking. He's gonna set you up with a sweet spot right at the main entrance so you'll never be late again. This is Crazy-Eyes Margot, from Housekeeping. She's gonna make sure that you got freshly-pressed scrubs in your locker every morning. 'Course, this is Troy, you know him from the cafeteria line. He's gonna stop spitting in your food.
10046	J.D.	Thank you...for that.
10047	Troy	I still don't understand...why we got to be nice to this pal.
10048	Janitor	'Cause I said so.
10049	Troy	Yeah, but!
10050	Janitor	Troy! No more warnings.Whoa! Bring the hands in.Bless us, O Lord, in these thy gifts which we are about to receive from thy bounty. Through Christ our Lord, Amen. Look out for each and every one of us, including our new member. Also...help Margot to find her way home tonight.
10051	J.D.'s Narration	Still...something was bothering me.
10052	Dr. Townshend	Bob, come on, how many more times are you gonna make me apologize for introducing you to your wife?
10053	Dr. Kelso	Once a month, until she's dead!
10054	J.D.	Excuse me, sir, do you have a second?
10055	Dr. Kelso	Sport, what did I tell you about my open-door policy? I don't have one.
10056	J.D.	Dr. Kelso, I was the one who nicked the artery on Mr. Singer.
10057	Dr. Townshend	Oh, cheese on rice, son! I just said it was me!
10058	Dr. Kelso	You need to shape up, son. Lord knows you're never gonna get by on your looks.
10059	J.D.	All right, first of all, at the very least I'm interesting looking; all right? And secondly, I...feel I made that mistake because Dr. Townshend forced me to perform a procedure that is unsafe and...outdated.
10060	J.D.'s Thoughts	Sorry, Townsie.
10061	Dr. Kelso	Now, let me get this straight: You screwed up doing something you should've been able to handle, and now you're in here to tattle on the very guy who's taken the bullet for you. Is that right?
10062	Dr. Townshend	Do me a favor, will ya, son? Grab that for me?Thanks!
10063	J.D.	I'm sorry, sir.

10065	Dr. Wen	Kelly clamp.
10066	Turk	One Kelly clamp coming right up.Hey, Rowdy!
10067	Dr. Wen	You seem distracted. Is something wrong?
10068	Turk	No, sir. I call everyone..."Rowdy."
10069	Kevin	What did you want me to do? Leave him in the car?
10070	Turk	It's bad enough you freaked out my girlfriend, but now you wanna get me fired! Why don't you just smack me in my face?
10071	Kevin	Fine. Hey, check this out!I can't believe that you're giving me attitude. I've taken care of you your entire life, and I come here and I tell you that I'm getting divorced, and you make it all about you!
10072	Turk	Well, you didn't seem too broken up about it, Kevin! Why should I care?
10073	Kevin	She left me, okay?
10074	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
10075	Dr. Cox	All righty, there, Dr. Leverage. Listen up, because here's the real 'inside scoop': I could literally sculpt a gigantic Mr. Burnett out of what I just removed _from_ Mr. Burnett. So, I really think it's in your best interest for you to start talking. Should I get the child a baseball glove or a tutu?
10076	Elliot	Well, girls can play baseball, too!
10077	Dr. Cox	Oh, yak-yak-yak-yak I know what girls can do! You've come a long way, baby. Spill, doll.
10078	Elliot	Look, I really think that you should think about this. So, I wrote it down, and I put it in an envelope, and then I gave it to...her.
10079	Jordan	Hi, Honey.
10080	Dr. Cox	Oh, you are just so gonna pay for this.
10081	Elliot	Yeah...well, uh, so are you.
10082	Jordan	Bend over, baby.
10083	Dr. Cox	Oh!
10084	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
10085	Dr. Kelso	I think Mr. Singer's going to be just fine.
10086	Dr. Townshend	Oh, geez, Bob! Don't creep up on me like that! I almost dropped some fruit in my loops!
10087	Dr. Kelso	I'm sorry, buddy. Say, listen, uh...nowadays it has become kind of hospital protocol to do modified Seldinger in a case like this. You _do_ know how to do one of those, don't you?
10088	Dr. Townshend	'Course!
10089	Dr. Kelso	Good. Because the patient in bed number 2 needs one. You mind doing it for me?
10090	Dr. Townshend	What the hell's this all about?
10091	Dr. Kelso	Nothing! I was, uh, just looking over your files and, um...well...your osteoporotic patients aren't on Bisphosphonate; your diabetics aren't on ACE inhibitors. Doug, a lot of your treatments are pretty out of date.
10092	Dr. Townshend	Come on, Bob, I'm guys like us, we're set in our ways.
10093	Dr. Kelso	Well, this is not an age thing, Doug. Hell, these days if you've been out of med school five years, half of what you learned is obsolete. Why do you think I spend every other weekend at a seminar in some two-star hotel ballroom that still stinks of last night's prom vomit? I do it because I have to keep up.
10094	Dr. Townshend	Also, it gives you two days away from the missus, right? Once again, I am sorry I was the one who introduced you in the first place!Look, Bob, I just...I don't have the energy for all that stuff.
10095	Dr. Kelso	Well...then we got a problem.
10096	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
10097	Turk	So, you wanna talk about what happened?
10098	Kevin	Nah, man, look, it's it's just too depressing.
10099	Turk	Kevin, you're in a bad place right now, but you're gonna get through it. You just gotta give it time.
10100	Kevin	Yeah, well what am I supposed to do until then?
10101	Turk	Barkeep, I'm gonna need these two glasses, and that bottle of whisky.'Scuse me, yes, my brother definitely needs to borrow your hat. And for the love of all that is holy! Will somebody please put on some country!
10102	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
10103	Jordan	We are a horrible couple.
10104	Dr. Cox	You couldn't be more wrong. Because, even though that isn't my kid in there, I still want to feel connected. And I just thought I'd be more hooked in if I knew.
10105	Jordan	It's funny. Every time I think you're the same old sharp-edged jack-ass, you turn around and do something to remind me that you're such a pansy.
10106	Dr. Cox	Ahh.
10107	Jordan	Listen, I was really hoping that the two of us could find out when the baby comes. But, if you really need to know now, just keep it to yourself.
10108	Dr. Cox	Yeah, run away, there, missy. 'Cause guilt trips don't work on ol' Perr-a-reeno. Ah?
10109	Dr. Kelso	Sport, if you're still standing there when I turn around, I'm gonna have them erase your name, too.
10110	J.D.	Goodnight, sir.
10111	J.D.'s Narration	It's not always easy to do the right thing.
10112	Turk	This is to my brother, y'all! My brother!
10113	J.D.'s Narration	Like putting someone else's feelings first for a change.Even if it goes against what you really want.
10114	Dr. Cox	I'm out.
10115	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, there's always ramifications....
10116	J.D.	My car....
10117	Troy	Yeeeeeeee-ha!
10118	J.D.	You think it's my fault he got fired, don't you.
10119	Janitor	Why would you say that?
10120	J.D.	No reason.
10121	Troy	Let's see ya drive home now, Mr. Doctor-Man!
10122	Janitor	Troy. I said just stand there, didn't I.
10123	Troy	Yeah....
10124	Janitor	I may have to get rid of the guy.
10125	J.D.'s Narration	Even if you do the right thing, there's no guarantee it'll turn out the right way.
10126	Kevin	He ain't heavy...he's my brother....
10127	Turk	the brother!
10128	Kevin	Oh, oh. She, uh, she's not with him. And she ain't with me. She's, uh, she’s with Rowdy not like not like that.
10129	J.D.'s Narration	Because, even something as harmless as twenty or thirty drinks with your brother can end up biting you on the ass.
10130	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
10131	J.D.'s Narration	Turk's relationship is so messed up right now that I decided to lighten his mood. And nothing cracks him up more than the old block-the-door-with-my-foot gag.
10132	Carla	Ooh! Ow! Oh, oh, okay.
10133	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oops. Wrong person.
10134	Carla	What happened?
10135	J.D.	A card musta got stuck. Gotta go!
10136	Turk	Baby, you know how much I care about you, right?
10137	Carla	I'm dizzy.
10138	Turk	Yeah, you're fine. Honey, I know it looked really bad last night, with me and Kevin coming home all liquored up with a really hot chick, but Kevin was freaking out about his divorce and I was just trying to be supportive.
10139	Dr. Cox	Yeah, by dragging home some random bar skank.
10140	Turk	Yeah, dude, you're not helping.
10141	Dr. Cox	Not trying to help.
10142	Turk	The point is, I have figured out why you're not ready to marry me yet. You think I'm too immature.
10143	Carla	It's not about that.
10144	Turk	Is it my sleep toots? 'Cause, Baby, I will stop having dairy after six.
10145	Carla	I don't know what it is, Turk. Since the moment you asked me, all I wanted to do was say yes. It's just that, every time I try to, something stops me. You just...have to be patient.
10146	Turk	Yeah, about that....
10147	Carla	So, he just said he was gonna keep asking until I said yes.
10148	Elliot	That was exactly how I lost my virginity. Except, I'm guessing Turk didn't propose in Jim Vilicetti's crawl-space.
10149	Carla	Yes?
10150	Turk	Woo-hoo! You said yes! We're getting married! We're getting married!
10151	Carla	Turk. Stop celebrating that's just how I answer the phone. ... Honey, it's only been ten minutes since we last talked....
10152	Paul	Don't you hate it when people yap away on their cell phones.
10153	Elliot	She is my friend....But she is _so_ rude.
10154	Paul	Hey, don't you work at the hospital, too?
10155	Elliot	Yeah. Um...I actually just got off a double shift, that's...why I look so gross.
10156	Paul	You don't look gross. And you know what? You don't even _think_ you look gross. I'm guessing you're one of those girls who uses the self-deprecating thing as a defense mechanism; even though, without looking, you can tell right now how many guys are checking you out.
10157	Elliot	Okay, five.
10158	Paul	No, no. Actually, it's four the guy in the mullet, he's checking me out.I let him buy my last two drinks.Thanks again, cowboy!

10163	Together	Thank you, Jenny.
10164	J.D.	Yoooooooo! Check out these fries! That girl is so in to me.
10165	Turk	Please, she's totally crushing on the brother.
10166	J.D.	Why, because you're black?
10167	Turk	'Kay, let's get one thing straight: This has nothing to do with me being black this has something to do with me being smooth, dawg
10168	Jenny	Oh. Here's a towel.And here are your shakes.
10169	J.D.	Thank you, Jenny. Hey, wait, Jenny. Uh, what flavor do you usually go for: Do you like chocolate or _vanilla_?
10170	Jenny	I'm a vanilla girl.
10171	J.D.	Mmm?
10172	Jenny	I'll go get you some more towels.

10178	Elliot	See you tomorrow.Oh my God!What?
10179	Carla	I'm just not big on public displays of affection, that's all.
10180	Turk	Hit it!

10187	J.D.'s Narration	I've gotta say, life is pretty good. I've hit my stride as a doctor, all my patients are doing well, and I've finally figured out that, even though they're horribly uncomfortable, my medium scrubs have a large effect on the ladies.Yep, everything is just great. I feel like, for the first time since I started here, I have no stories to tell.
10188	Dr. Cox's Narration	Sometimes you know it's gonna be a crappy day from the moment you wake up. Today was one of those days.See, I have an appointment to see my shrink, and it feels like there's a little friction between us.
10189	Cox's Shrink	You will _not_ beat me.
10190	Dr. Cox	Listen, Doctor, while we're on me, just for a second, uh, my very pregnant ex-wife would like me to take a couple of days off and travel to her mother's house so that we can reconnect as a family.
10191	Cox's Shrink	And I assume that you told her to blow it out her ass.
10192	Dr. Cox	You get me! Darn it, you do!
10193	Cox's Shrink	Yes.... We're like two peas in a horrible, horrible pod.
10194	Dr. Cox	Anyway, I have invited a couple of my friends over to the apartment while she's gonna to be gone we're gonna have some beers, watch the game, it's gonna be great and I was wondering if you
10195	Cox's Shrink	I'm not your friend!
10196	Dr. Cox	They're not, either.
10197	Cox's Shrink	So, how's your rage going lately?
10198	Dr. Cox	Aggggghhhhhhh! Agggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhh! Aggggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!Better!
10199	Cox's Shrink	Okay, the next time you feel the anger welling up in your meaty chest
10200	Dr. Cox	Oh, give it to me.
10201	Cox's Shrink	...I want you to take a deep breath and count to ten before you react. Do you think you could do that, Perry?
10202	Dr. Cox	For the record, I'm not a child. Okay?
10203	Doug	Uh, Dr. Cox?Um...I just wanted to tell you, uh.... W-w-what the thing is is, uh....
10204	Dr. Cox's Thoughts	One....Two....Ten.
10205	Doug	Um
10206	Dr. Cox	Finish the sentence in the next two seconds or start running.Oh, dear God, you're actually frozen with fear. All right, don't worry about a thing, I'm going to talk you through this. I want you to relax, take a big breath, and now... get out of here!! You go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go!

10211	Dr. Cox	I don't care!

10213	Dr. Kelso	Perry! Hi, how are you, etcetera. The wife and I just took out a new insurance policy, and I need a physical.
10214	Dr. Cox	Bob, the day I willingly cradle your dusty old twig and berries and get a whiff of your chronic halitosis while you turn your head and cough is the day you can look for me up on the roof singing, "I Believe I Can Fly."
10215	Dr. Kelso	Great stuff! See you about two-ish.
10216	Dr. Cox	Uh.
10217	J.D.	You should just do it.
10218	Dr. Cox	Really?
10219	J.D.	Well, it'd only take fifteen minutes of your life, and it wouldn't hurt to be in good with him for once.
10220	Dr. Cox	You're giving me advice?
10221	J.D.	Yeah. Feel free to return the favor.
10222	Dr. Cox	Fair enough. Try this on for size: No matter where you go in life, always keep an eye out for Johnny, the tackling Alzheimer's patient.

10253	Dr. Kelso	Save the 'racket' for the tennis court, big guy. I have taken the liberty of filling out the form, all you have to do is sign right below where it says "Fit as a 26-year-old."
10254	Dr. Cox	You're not suggesting that I rubber-stamp your insurance physical, are you, there, Bobbo?
10255	Dr. Kelso	Just...sign the damn form!

10292	Turk	It's gotta be The Todd.
10293	Carla	Turk, will you stop?Yes, I've never been a big fan of surgeons. And, yes, I worry about your maturity sometimes I'm a worrier, it's what I do. But you have _got_ to stop trying to pinpoint what the reason is.
10294	Turk	'Cause there's so many of them, right? I mean, you don't like who I am...you don't like what I do....
10295	Carla	Come on. I like the way I have to stand up on my tippy-toes to kiss you.
10296	Turk	It's not enough.

10298	Todd	Hey, Elliot, I heard you got your nursing degree in the 'male'...nurse! Wazzaaaaap.
10299	Dr. Zeltzer	That's her. Don't look!
10300	Dr. Kelso	Murse!
10301	Paul	Whoa, Doctor! Hey, I'm not that type of gal.
10302	Elliot	Shut up, Paul! You are a man! And I am a woman!
10303	Paul	Elliot, are you okay?

10305	Cox's Shrink	I got very drunk last night.... And I decided that I'm not giving up on you. So...how'd you do with my counting exercise?
10306	Dr. Cox	Honestly, I tried it once and I thought it was stupid.
10307	Cox's Shrink	That's it we're done.
10308	Dr. Cox	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You're dumping _me_?
10309	Cox's Shrink	I hope we can remain friends!
10310	Dr. Cox	Oh, now, please don't take away the privilege of letting me pay you two hundred dollars an hour so that I can drag my ass in here and watch you nod. God knows the only other place I can get that on the planet is from my Brett Favre bobble-head doll.
10311	Cox's Shrink	Fine. You want to know what I really think? Your problem isn't that you make bad choices, it's that you identify the good choice and then intentionally do the opposite. You see, behind this boorish bravado of yours is a paralyzing fear of letting anyone into your life. And it isn't because you weren't _loved when you were a kid_, it's because you're so ego-centered that the love wasn't enough. So, you pulled pig-tails and you pushed the fat kids into the dirt so no one could ignore little Perry. Well "little Perry" is now forty years old. And you're so invested in this neurotic, narcissistic notion of yourself as "_loner_" that you can't quit. And you'll just keep dumping on everyone around you, until eventually and please, trust me on this there won't be anyone left.
10312	Dr. Cox's Narration	There's a million reasons a relationship can crash and burn....
10313	Dr. Cox	Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hooooo.... Gimme a break.
10314	Dr. Cox's Narration	Whether it's because you don't have the stones to make it work...
10315	Elliot	Sorry, I have to...um...cancel tonight.
10316	Dr. Cox's Narration	...or, you just get sick and tired of jumping through hoops.
10317	Turk	Okay, you win; all right, you don't have to worry about me asking you over and over anymore.
10318	Dr. Cox's Narration	Eventually, everyone bails.
10319	J.D. comes to the front door and knocks	knock, knock-knock, knock, knock...
10320	J.D.	"Two bits."
10321	Dr. Cox	If it isn't my favorite career counselor. You wouldn't happen to have any more tips on how to climb _down_ the ladder, would ya?
10322	J.D.	I've been doing some thinking, about how you're always blaming me for everything, and how you just send a constant stream of crap my way...and...I decided I need a break.
10323	Dr. Cox	So, what'd you come by to tell me you're a complete wuss?
10324	J.D.	No. I...came over here to tell you that I traded with another resident and switched off your service for a while.
10325	Dr. Cox	Well, tears-&-hugs, there, Katie. But, unless you want to come inside, here, and give one of the fellas a lap-dance, I'm afraid I gotta say Sayonara, 'cause I got twenty guys in here and it's about to get nutty! All the best, baby.

10327	Dr. Cox's Narration	Turns out, last night got in my head. So, this morning, I swallowed my pride and asked Dr. Gross to take me back.
10328	Cox's Shrink	I have a hammer in my desk.
10329	Dr. Cox's Narration	...It...did not go well.
10330	Doug	Uh, Dr. Cox. I was the one who switched with J.D.
10331	Dr. Cox	Nervous Guy.... How you feeling?
10332	Doug	A little nervous.
10333	Dr. Cox	Oh, that's okay. Don't worry about a thing, 'cause I'm gonna ease you in. Here's the deal: You have exactly eight seconds to find this patient's chart or you're through here.
10334	Doug	God! Chart? Chart? Anyone?
10335	Nurse Roberts	You want me to look for it?
10336	Doug	Did anyone see a chart?!
10337	Dr. Cox	Nah, I got the chart right here.
10338	Doug	Agh! Chart!?!

10340	Elliot	Cheer-up hug?
10341	Carla	What?
10342	Elliot	Well, when I was little, and something made me sad, my mom would always have the maid give me a cheer-up hug.
10343	Carla	Ahhh, further explaining your love of the Latino people.
10344	Elliot	Carla, whenever you need to talk....
10345	Carla	You know, it's just that I don't think that Turk is being fair. He didn't get the answer that he wanted when he wanted it, so now he's pushing
10346	Paul	What do you want?Okay, wait, wait, wait. Now, are you kissing me because you actually want this to go somewhere, or because you feel bad about blowing me off yesterday?

10348	Paul	Actually, I don't care either way.

10350	J.D.	I just had to bail on Cox for a while, you know? I mean, the guy sees a shrink every day, and he's still the biggest pain in my ass.
10351	Turk	Is he in group?
10352	Guy	Maybe it's not everybody else maybe it's you.
10353	Guy 2	Yeah.
10354	Woman	Uh-huh.
10355	Guy 2	Good sharing.
10356	Dr. Cox	I see your point.
10357	Woman	That's right.
10358	Guy 2	Mm-hmm.
10359	Dr. Cox	Anybody got anything else?
10360	Woman 2	Yeah, I've got one.
10361	Dr. Cox	Come here!
10362	J.D.	I don't think he'd do well in group. So, uh, what's up with Carla?
10363	Turk	I'm starting to think that if she really loved me I'd know by now. Maybe it's time to retreat, protect myself, so I don't get hurt any worse. I really don't want to talk about it, though.
10364	J.D.	Sure.
10365	Jenny	Here you go, fellas.
10366	Together	Thank you, Jenny.
10367	Jenny	You're welcome!
10368	J.D.	Ahhh, eight strips of bacon! That girl is all _about_ the J.Dizzle.
10369	Turk	Oh, yeah?

10375	Dr. Cox	What is it, there, Bobbo.
10376	Dr. Kelso	I'm sorry.
10377	Dr. Cox	What did you say?
10378	Dr. Kelso	I spoke to my cardiologist, and he said if you hadn't caught my high blood-pressure, and it had continued unchecked, it, uh, might have resulted in a mild case of....death.
10379	Dr. Cox's Thoughts	Must...fight urge...to rub it...in his face!
10380	Dr. Kelso	Anyway, I owe you one.
10381	Dr. Cox's Thoughts	Must...rub something...in...someone's...face!!

10388	Paul	Uh, she's covering because she's embarrassed that she likes a nurse. And I really can't figure out why.
10389	Dr. Kelso	Well, that's because you're doing a woman's job, son. Have a good one.
10390	Elliot	Great. Why did you do that?
10391	Paul	You know, Elliot, what I do for a living, it doesn't make me feel like I'm any less of a man. Neither does my love of baking...or gardening...or the fact that I occasionally menstruate.
10392	Elliot	_What_?!
10393	Paul	Elliot, lighten up. Stop worrying so much about what everybody else thinks.

10398	Cox's Shrink	Hello, Perry. You're obviously trying to bully me, but you can't bully me because I don't fear you. Now, I'm leaving.
10399	Dr. Cox	Kelso asked me to give him a physical, I did it, he said "thank you" and told me he owed me one.
10400	Cox's Shrink	You _actually_ made a decision that benefited your life personally and professionally?
10401	Dr. Cox	Well, a resident kinda talked me into it.
10402	Cox's Shrink	Yeah, come on, you're telling me that _you_ took the advice of another human being.It's a great moment for me.
10403	Dr. Cox	Congratulations.
10404	Cox's Shrink	Thank you. And Perry, if there's someone in your life at that hell-hole of a hospital who you actually listen to, you should do everything in your power to keep them around. Because that person is nothing short of a genius.

10409	J.D.	Because you did this!

10413	Carla	Hey, Laverne, have you seen Turk around?
10414	Nurse Roberts	He's off today, Honey. How come you don't know that?
10415	Carla	I don't know....
10416	Elliot	Listen up everybody! I appreciate solidarity, but I did not blow off Paul because he's a nurse; so, please stop leaving bedpans in my locker it makes me cry. Paul and I are just...different, okay.
10417	Carla	Please, Elliot, this is not about Paul.... This is about you! This is about you not being able to commit, because committing means saying goodbye to whatever unfulfilled fantasy of love you've concocted after seeing too many Meg Ryan movies. But men don't come and make everything all better they're only human. And you shouldn't punish him because you were forced to grow up so fast you never learned how to let someone else take care of you. He's not your father, okay, he's not necessarily gonna disappear at the first sign of trouble. And, as scary as it is to consider letting yourself be truly vulnerable with another human being, what's even scarier is that deep down inside you know you picked this man...and if you run away from him now, you'll be running away from being the kind of person you always wanted to be.
10418	Elliot	Carla, I...just met the guy!
10419	Turk	All right, here we go, baby; here we go.
10420	Jenny	Are you talking to your chili dog!?
10421	Turk	What? Hey!Uh, yeah well, I find that they don't repeat on me as much if I'm real friendly to 'em.
10422	Jenny	Oh.What?
10423	Turk	Nothing, it's just it's just weird seeing you out in the real world, you know, I feel kind of guilty. 'Cause you're so nice to me and my buddy, and we've never even had a real conversation. Instead, we act like school kids and argue over who we think you got a crush on.

10431	Janitor	Well, sometimes in life you gotta do what you gotta do.
10432	J.D.	Look, I promise you the "door open" button was not working.
10433	Janitor	Mm-hmm. No, it's okay. We're gonna be able to work this thing out, seriously.Put your hands together like you're praying.
10434	J.D.	Oh, hey, Dr. Cox! Good to see you!
10435	Dr. Cox's Thoughts	Oh, what the hell, he's a decent kid. Be a man and apologize to him, from the heart for once.
10436	Dr. Cox	Oh, for God's sake, Lilly, stop being such a complete wuss and come back to work with me!
10437	J.D.	Fine.
10438	Dr. Cox	Good.
10439	Dr. Cox's Thoughts	Oh, just give him a pat on the back he's been wanting it since day one.Just do it!
10440	J.D.'s Narration	The second that Dr. Cox patted me on the shoulder, I thought about how he always shows up in the nick of time.
10441	Janitor	Hey, I'll hang on to this!
10442	J.D.'s Narration	I guess, in the end, everything comes down to timing.Sometimes, you just have one moment to seize it.
10443	Elliot	Paul. I know that I've been acting like an insecure idiot, but...if you'll forgive me, I'd love to take you for dinner tonight.
10444	Paul	Screw that. I'll cook for you.I've only got one apron, though; so, bring your own if you want to wear one.
10445	Dr. Kelso	Hmmm!
10446	Elliot	Oh, please. You all wish you could bag a nurse.
10447	Dr. Zeltzer	She's right.
10448	Dr. Kelso	Shut up, Zeltzer!
10449	Dr. Zeltzer	You shut up.
10450	J.D.'s Narration	And if your timing is good, and it works out for you, make sure you cherish it. Because bad timing can mess up everything.

10466	J.D.	Oh, come on, this is the only way to celebrate, right? With close friends...and...Nurse Roberts....
10467	Nurse Roberts	Oh, hey, now, don't get all pissy now. You said "My treat, order whatever you want." You didn't say "order whatever you want except the lobster."
10468	J.D.	I said "no shellfish."
10469	J.D.'s Narration	I wasn't really mad. This was great except for one thing.
10470	Paul	Hey, you can't celebrate without beer.
10471	Turk	You're absolutely right!
10472	J.D.'s Narration	Sure, Paul was dating Elliot. But, luckily, I'm not the jealous type.
10473	J.D.	Okay, I'll, uh, I'll go ahead and and make a little toast, here. Uh, a toast that only people that've known...Turk and Carla more than a week will understand. You guys rock. You do.
10474	J.D.'s Thoughts	How's that taste, Blondie!
10475	Paul	You guys, you know, I've just gotten to know you as a couple, but you remind me of my grandparents. They were married for sixty-five years, and every night before Grandpa and Grandma would walk around the block, he would look deep into her eyes as if to say, "I'd follow you anywhere." Anyway, the way you two just looked at each other, I could have sworn I was looking at them.

10480	J.D.	We missed another tumor?
10481	Dr. Kelso	Who cares! The point is, I have to go across the street to get coffee! Piping-hot coffee that puts a hop in your step and your ass in the john.
10482	Mr. Simms	I just wish I really knew why it hurt so much right here.
10483	Turk	Well, Mr. Simms, it could be because it's damp out. It could also be because, four days ago, I sliced your chest open with a giant knife. You had surgery, buddy, you'll be fine.Hey, Dr. Dorian, I have a couple of minutes off. Would you like me to show you that technique I was telling you about?
10484	J.D.	Yes, Doctor.
10485	Turk	See, now, what you want to do is choke up on the club like this? And then hit this bad boy like a baseball!
10486	J.D.	You can't teach that.
10487	Turk	No you cannot, my friend. No you cannot!
10488	J.D.	So, what was up with Mr. Simms back there?
10489	Turk	Ahhh, during his open-lung biopsy, I accidentally nicked his intercostal artery, and now he's got a hematoma.
10490	J.D.	Are you gonna tell him?
10491	Turk	What, and risk a lawsuit? Are you crazy? Besides, it'll heal just fine, anyway. Hey, throw me another ball.
10492	J.D.	Yeah, but...don't you believe in bad karma?
10493	Turk	No!
10494	Dr. Kelso	Hot cuppa lava, coming through.Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaggggggggggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!
10495	J.D.	I dunno. Me, I think karma keeps the universe in order.

10506	J.D.	There she is! Are you ready to be born today! Jeebeedeebeejeebee....
10507	Jordan	Get the hell away from my stomach, or I'll put you in a leg-lock and snap your little bird-neck with my enormous thighs.
10508	J.D.	Enjoy your special day.
10509	Jordan	Thanks.
10510	Dr. Cox	Now, in honor of this little goblin's arrival, I have gone ahead and taken care of everything: Dr. Gerson will be _waiting_ to induce you; she will also administer the world's largest epidural. I have wealthily under-qualified residents covering all of my patients, so that I can be with you every step of the way. And, here's the kicker: I have traded every single one of my weekends, I have called in every favor, and I have kissed every pompous, wrinkled ass in this fluorescent hell-hole, so that I could secure for you the one and only mack-daddy, out-of-your-mind birthing suite in this entire hospital!

10529	J.D.	I said, "Not pregnant." Is this thing on? And hey! What is the deal with Q-Tips? They're not Qs, and they're not tips!Uhhh, but unfortunately, the CAT-scan suggests a laceration in your spleen, which is why I asked for a surgical consult. So, how'd this happen, anyway?

10534	Jordan	Did you explain to her that it is _my_ room?
10535	Dr. Cox	I started to, but then she screamed, grunted, and pooped on the table. God , it always cracks me up that they never tell pregnant women to expect that one!
10536	Jordan	I'm going to _poo_ in front of people!?
10537	Dr. Cox	No.... Yeah!

10550	Elliot	Mm-hmm?
10551	Carla	and it wasn't until last week that I admitted the reason I don't touch the seat when I go to the bathroom isn't because of germs but because I'm afraid of toilet snakes.
10552	Elliot	Aaaaand now so am I.
10553	Carla	Look, I think, with men, you just have to hold out until they're invested enough they won't run away at the first thing that spooks them.
10554	Elliot	I know.... And, with Paul, I really feel like we're getting pretty close right now!
10555	Carla	So...you guys have...?
10556	Elliot	Not yet, but tonight's our fourth date, so....

10564	J.D.	This guy's gonna sue the hospital, we're gonna get fired, we'll have to become male whores.Very successful male whores we'll probably have a nicer apartment and some bling-bling, but male whores nonetheless!
10565	Turk	Relax, all right? Nobody knows about this but us. We'll be fine.
10566	Janitor	Hey, guys! Check out the personalized golf club cozy I found on the roof!"Hi, Davey!"
10567	J.D.	You and your stupid Christmas present!
10568	Janitor	Yeah.... Seems like one of the golf balls you hit went through the windshield of my van. No big deal, I just expect you to replace it, that's all.
10569	J.D.	Wait, wait, wait. Your your windshield's been broken for like a year!
10570	Janitor	Yeah! Yeah, I know. Still. "Oh, no! Looks like we're in a...pickle! Pick pick pickle!" boogida-boogida-boogida-boogida-boogida-boogida-boogida-boogida-boo Pop! Here's the keys, have it back by tomorrow. Who're you?

10574	Dr. Cox	I'm not gonna lie to you, there, Bob; I have not been having the greatest day.
10575	Dr. Kelso	Perry, I just drew in this eyebrow five minutes ago, so cry me a river.
10576	Dr. Cox	Anyway, Jordan and I got stuck in this crappy room, and I was wondering if....if....whoo, well....
10577	Dr. Kelso	Perry, if you want a favor, don't beat around the bush. Just...curtsy.
10578	Dr. Cox	I beg your pardon, there, Backdraft?
10579	Dr. Kelso	You heard what I said. Well?Always remember how I made you do that.Ha ha ha! Oh!

10581	Lawyer	Hey, fellas! Always nice to have visitors! So, uh, what's the dealio?
10582	J.D.	Ted.... How bad would it really be if, uh, two doctors were hitting golf balls off the roof and they caused a car accident and the driver needed surgery?Ted?
10583	Lawyer	Hey, fellas! Always nice to have visitors! So, what's the dealio?
10584	J.D.	No dealio, Ted, we just stopped by to say "Hi." ...Hi.
10585	Turk	See you later, buddy.
10586	Lawyer	Later!
10587	J.D.'s Narration	We both knew what we had to do.
10588	J.D.	Let's come clean.
10589	Turk	Let's not tell anyone! Ever! Ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever! EVER!
10590	J.D.	Ever?
10591	Turk	Ever!
10592	J.D.'s Narration	I guess it's hard to predict how a person will react.
10593	Elliot	So...you wanna come in?
10594	Paul	No, it's okay. I'll see you tomorrow.
10595	Dr. Cox	Well, then, Jordan, why don't we just think of today as as a test run.
10596	J.D.'s Narration	Other times, people react exactly how you think they will.
10597	Jordan	Honestly, Perry, the only way I could have felt more taken care of is if I were at a four-star resort, or a spa...or a third-world country where you have to boil your own sewage if you want something to drink! Oh, and by the way? A giant, giant feather in your cap for how much power you wield in this hospital after 15 years.
10598	Dr. Cox	Come on, come on, come on, Jordan. I am so sorry everything fell apart today, honest-to-God, I am. But I guarantee that when you get here tomorrow, Dr. Gerson will, in fact, be in the super-deluxe birthing suite so that you can go ahead and have that story-book, drug-addled, Pitocin-induced pregnancy that you've always dreamed of ever since you were a little girl. But, in the meantime, you've gotta cut me a little slack. I mean, come on, it's not like I see the real father running around here, busting his hump.
10599	Jordan	Ohh, that's nice. I'm going home.
10600	Dr. Cox	No, no you're not.
10601	Jordan	Bye-bye!
10602	Dr. Cox	Jordan, your water just broke.
10603	Jordan	This kid's annoying me already.

10605	Dr. Donna	I think having babies is so much fun! Don't you!
10606	Jordan	I will choke her.
10607	Dr. Cox	Please, Dr. Brulatti, no more talking.
10608	Dr. Donna	Oh, you know, I really prefer "Dr. Donna"!
10609	Dr. Cox	No means no, pep-squad. Now beat it.And, Jordan, I am not gonna leave your side until that baby is delivered.
10610	Jordan	Get the hell out of here.
10611	Dr. Cox	What?
10612	Jordan	I'm serious. Why don't you do us both a favor and get out.
10613	Dr. Cox	...Fine.
10614	Dr. Donna	It's important to stay positive!
10615	Jordan	GET ME AN EPIDURAL BEFORE I RIP YOUR TEETH OUT!
10616	Dr. Donna	Okie-dokie!
10617	Dr. Cox	Hey, Girl's Name!
10618	J.D.	What?
10619	Dr. Cox	Gimme a break I got a lot on my mind, Ellen! Ooh! Look at that! I bounced back! A-hey-anyway, the cave bat just kicked me out of its lair, and seeing as I no longer have my all-access pass to crazy town, I'm going to need you to occasionally go in there and poke her with a broomstick, just to see how she's doing.
10620	J.D.	Dr. Cox
10621	Dr. Cox	Uh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh! Please! Just...check on her, 'kay? All right.
10622	J.D.	But what if she has the baby while I'm in there?
10623	Jordan	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
10624	Dr. Donna	Here it comes!
10625	J.D.	What the hell is that?
10626	Dr. Donna	Goo-goo, ga-ga! Ga-ga, goo-goo! Goo-goo! Gee-gee! Agh!
10627	J.D.	AAAGGGHHH!! GAH! Oh, somebody get it off!!!!!!

10630	Paul	Elliot, wait up. Elliot.
10631	Elliot	Hey.
10632	Paul	I wanted to explain about last night. We had a great time, and I know that you wanted me to come in to...you know....
10633	Elliot	Oh, no, no, no! I invited you in to see my...fish tank.
10634	Todd	Is that what you ladies are calling it nowadays?
10635	Paul	Careful, Todd.
10636	Todd	Sorry, Nurse Flowers, sir.
10637	Paul	Elliot, listen, I think you're an amazing girl, I really do. But...something just didn't feel right about last night. It's just that I've rushed things with people in the past, and I don't want to do that with you.
10638	Elliot's Thoughts	What does he mean "in the past"? Does he have an ex-girlfriend? Is that her? Slut!
10639	Elliot	I feel the same way. Heh.
10640	Nurse	Hey!
10641	Elliot	Oh, I am on to you.Go on. Heh.

10643	Dr. Cox	So, now...why'd you finally agree to marry Gandhi?
10644	Carla	Well, he's amazing in bed...and he has an awesome CD collection.
10645	Dr. Cox	Seriously, what got you to the point where you weren't scared anymore?
10646	Carla	Please! I'm still terrified! I mean, good luck finding a pen cap at the nurses' station. Know why?
10647	Dr. Cox	Why?
10648	Carla	Ate 'em all.
10649	Dr. Cox	Sounds like good roughage to me.
10650	Carla	What do you do when you get scared?
10651	Dr. Cox	Run away, get a divorce, drink alone.... You know, the classics. The thing is that, this time, I am killing myself for this woman, and I'm still getting my ass handed to me.
10652	Carla	There is no Shangri-La, you know? Every relationship is messed up. What makes it perfect is if you still want to be there when things really suck.
10653	Dr. Cox	Yeah, well, I'm not so sure.
10654	Carla	It'll come to you.

10656	Janitor	All right, gentlemen, either of you in the market for a van? Five hundred bucks.
10657	Turk	The windshield cost that much.
10658	Janitor	Oh. Eight hundred.
10659	J.D.	No thanks.
10660	Janitor	Come on.... There's still half a deer in the back! I think that's a deer.
10661	J.D.'s Narration	After being blackmailed, I decided to check in on Jordan.
10662	Jordan	You tell me, Donna! Do I look like I need more drugs!?!
10663	Dr. Donna	Ow! My face!
10664	J.D.'s Thoughts	Then again, I have other problems. Because I know that some windshield hush-money won't keep the karma gods from coming after Turk and me.
10665	Nurse Roberts	Q-Tip, Dr. Murphy called, they need you to cover his call tonight.
10666	Todd	Dude! Dr. Wen's doing a stomach stapling, and he wants you to be there to hold back the guy's fat flap.
10667	Dr. Kelso	Apparently my face is scaring my patients, so you're going to take them off my hands for about a week.
10668	J.D.	Turk! The Dairy Queen burned down!
10669	Turk	No!
10670	J.D.	Now do you see?

10672	Elliot	I can't take it, Carla! I cannot hide the crazy a minute longer! And the worst part is, Paul is this sweet, perfect guy who actually wants to take things slow with me, and I'm just this big mountain of cuckoo who's about to erupt and spew molten crazy all over him, and he's gonna die like this:
10673	Carla	Calm down, Elliot. Do what I used to do find people who don't even know Paul, and then just let it out in little bursts.
10674	Dr. Kelso	Good afternoon, ladies!
10675	Elliot	You know, when I was a kid, I got a sunburn like that and just peeled all the skin off, put it in a pile, and ate it.
10676	Dr. Kelso	Good Lord!

10678	J.D.'s Narration	For us, it was time to face the karmic music.
10679	Turk	We were the ones that hit your car with that golf ball.
10680	J.D.	Well, technically it was Dr. Turk.
10681	Turk	You...liar! Okay, it was _you_!
10682	J.D.	You know what, it really doesn't matter.
10683	Mr. Foster	What were you guys doing hitting golf balls way down town?
10684	Turk	Down town?
10685	J.D.	I...told you it wasn't us.
10686	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
10687	Paul	You know, this is almost exactly like the kind of picnics I had with my mother.
10688	Elliot	You're so cute!
10689	Paul	And now it's exactly like them.You got something in your tooth.
10690	Elliot's Thoughts	I can't believe I have something on my teeth. Get it off, get it off, get it off, get it off, get it off! Get it off!
10691	Elliot	Did I get it?
10692	Paul	Uh, no, but, don't worry about it. So, anyway, I was thinking....Elliot? Elliot! Is everything all right?
10693	Elliot	Everything's great! Yeah! Come here.What?
10694	Paul	It's just, well, this is what bothered me the other night. 'Cause I I know that there's something wrong, but y-you won't talk about it. I guess sometimes it it feels like you're holding back.
10695	Elliot	Of course I'm holding back! I'm insane, you idiot! Remember the other day, when you told me that I had pit stains? Well, I have cried every fifteen minutes on the half-hour since you told me that. I am wracked with self-doubt. I have panic attacks. I'm claustrophobic, germaphobic, phobiaphobic. I talk to myself. I talk to my cat. I talk to three separate shrinks about the fact that often my cats respond to me in my mother's voice. And yesterday, when that stupid pretty surgical nurse handed you a pair of latex gloves, I almost killed the guy whose leg I was stitching up because I couldn't stop thinking about the two of you having sex on a box of steaks! Why a box of steaks? 'Cause my dad had an affair with a female butcher! And, as I mentioned before, I am insane. There! I opened up! Are you happy?
10696	Paul	No. I'm incredibly turned on.
10697	Elliot	I gotta, uh, get this right off my teeth.Excuse me.Ow! I'm okay!

10699	J.D.'s Narration	I still believe in karma, and if I wasn't being punished for Mr. Golf Ball, I think I knew where my bad karma was coming from.
10700	Jordan	I don't know that many straight guys that wear cologne.
10701	J.D.	I'm down to one spritz.
10702	Jordan	Hm.
10703	J.D.	Look, Dr. Cox asked me to check in on you; I'm sorry I haven't been here until now.
10704	Jordan	He asked you to...check in on me?
10705	J.D.	Yep. So...? How ya doin'?
10706	Jordan	Well, I have ruined everything! All he tried to do was take care of me and show me that he loved me. But, no, I had to drive him away because I don't like being vulnerable even when I'm normal, let alone with my ankles in stirrups and my coochie on display. So, now he's gone away for good; and I would really like to get this stupid thing out of me so I can go home and kill myself!
10707	J.D.	Well, you sound good.
10708	Jordan	I was going to tell him the truth eventually, I just wanted to see if he was going to be with me because he _wanted_ to, not because he _had_ to. Do you know what I mean?
10709	J.D.	What are you talking about?
10710	Jordan	It's his baby, stupid! Don't tell anyone.
10711	Dr. Cox	All right, lookit, Kappa Gamma, here, says it's time to get this thing underway, so I don't care if you want me here or not I'm...staying.
10712	Jordan	Whatever, all right.
10713	Dr. Cox	Good. ...What're you two talking about?
10714	J.D.	Apartheid?
10715	Jordan	I-it's wrong.
10716	Dr. Cox	Oh!
10717	J.D.'s Narration	Call me new agey, but I think karma's a powerful force.
10718	Lawyer	I honestly don't know what put the idea of golfing on the roof in my head!
10719	Todd	Dude! It is so nice out here! You mind if I take it down to the banana hammock?
10720	J.D.'s Narration	Because I honestly believe, if you've got some bad karma coming your way, well...
10721	Lawyer	Hi, Dr. Kelso!
10722	J.D.'s Narration	...you can't hide from it.Karma's really just about doing the right thing.
10723	Turk	So, uh...anyway, Mr. Simms, I wanted to explain to you why your chest was hurting? During surgery, I....
10724	J.D.'s Narration	....Or about being who you really are.Either way, it's a lot to think about.
10725	Dr. Cox	Oh, my God. Would you look at the mug on Jordan's baby? Must have one butt-ugly father!
10726	J.D.	...Yeah....

10728	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
10729	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, you've been avoiding Dr. Cox ever since Jordan told you her baby was actually his. But this chance meeting is a sign. It's time to let go of the secret. You just need to find a smooth way in.
10730	J.D.	Hey, Dr. Cox! Takin' a wizz?
10731	Dr. Cox	We've been over this before, Newbie eyes front, no talking.
10732	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, fine. I'll just read the wall.
10733	J.D.	"J.D. has a tiny pickle"?
10734	Dr. Cox	Kudos for honesty, there, Newbie but, again, no talking.
10735	J.D.	Dr. Cox, I have to tell you something....
10736	Jordan	Oh! Perry, you pee standing up at work! That is so cute! Would you come on? We're on a very tight schedule.
10737	Dr. Cox	You know, Jordan, with all the baby weight you haven't lost yet, I just went ahead and assumed you'd be used to tight things by now.
10738	Jordan	Oh, that's lovely.Huh! Well, hello, sailor.
10739	J.D.	Ahoy.
10740	Dr. Cox	Oh, my goodness, Newbie. Are you so uncomfortable with Jordan here that you've, in fact, stopped peeing mid-stream?
10741	J.D.	I may have.
10742	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
10743	Dr. Kelso	Yes!
10744	J.D.	I wonder why Dr. Cox and Jordan got divorced? I mean, they act like they hate each other, but I think that's just for show.
10745	Turk	Yeah, whatever. Are you gonna stretch before we play basketball, or what?
10746	J.D.'s Narration	Turk likes to blow off steam by playing basketball before surgery. I always get my ass kicked.... But not today.
10747	J.D.	Grrrrrr.
10748	Turk	And that's game!
10749	J.D.	How the hell did we lose?! We have Chet!
10750	Chet	Sorry, man.
10751	J.D.	Chet, you suck!!!AAARRRGGGHHH!!!You know what, some stereotypes are true, Turk. Okay? And, just maybe, black people are a little better at basketball. Whatta you say?
10752	Nurse Roberts	HAH!
10753	Turk	Maybe a little.
10754	Nurse Roberts	Y'all got hockey.
10755	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
10756	J.D.	Why do you think they got divorced?
10757	Elliot	Oh, I have no idea. I just can't believe you had to pee in front of Jordan! I could _not_ do that. I mean, Paul's my boyfriend, and I make him turn the volume way up on the T.V. when I go. Plus, he's not allowed in the apartment an hour before _or_ after I do twosies.
10758	J.D.	Elliot, you're a doctor stop calling it "twosies."
10759	Elliot	Oh, with patients I say "dookie." Oh, dookie!
10760	J.D.	What?
10761	Dr. Cox	Well, now, Maggie! I can only assume that you are whiling away the morning cat-chatting with your favorite gal-pal because you've already finished your pre-rounding?
10762	J.D.	I haven't even started yet.
10763	Dr. Cox	What?
10764	J.D.	Gotcha! Finished!
10765	Dr. Cox	That's a good one, Newbie. My heart is racing. You are quite the prankster.
10766	J.D.	I could tell you some stories.
10767	Dr. Cox	And if there's a God in heaven, you never will. This is Mrs. Gracin's chart her private practice doctor just showed up, so I am off this one.
10768	J.D.	Well, is there anything I need to do for her lung nodule?
10769	Dr. Cox	Oh, I don't know. What do you say you start her on 20 CCs of It's not my problem anymore!

10780	J.D.	Yeah, we yeah.
10781	Pete	You're probably thinking, Why didn't you do that before I got here? But you weren't sure if you'd be over-stepping your boundaries. What if I was some sort of territorial ass with a giant ego or a territorial ego with a giant ass. Stop me, Sally, please!
10782	J.D.	Ha!
10783	Pete	And you're gonna help me. Need you to help me get Sally, here, out of bed; that way I can go back to trying to get her _into_ bed.
10784	Sally	Stop!
10785	Pete	You stop, foxy lady! Look, you're doing great. From now on, just follow your instincts, okay? And you, don't flirt so much.

10836	Pete	We have a little history.... Yeah....
10837	J.D.	What's up his pooper?
10838	Pete	Actually, I think he's mad 'cause I went into private practice and he's stuck in this hell-hole.
10839	J.D.	Yeah.
10840	Pete	You wouldn't believe this, but that guy was my mentor, man. I mean, I lived and breathed for that guy's approval.
10841	J.D.	That's lame.
10842	Pete	I know! Once you learn the tricks, though, he's easier to deal with; you'll see.
10843	J.D.	Tell me about it.
10844	Pete	Yeah!
10845	J.D.	No, no, I'm serious tell me about it.
10846	Pete	Oh! Ohh. Uh, well, you know when he gets on his rants, he gets all hyped up, his vein starts sticking out of his neck, and he starts yelling at ya when he's done, just look at him, stare him right in the eye, and say, "I'm sorry, what were you saying?"I don't know why, but it works; trust me.
10847	J.D.	No, I do. Now, how do you get him to stop calling you girl's names.
10848	Pete	Girl's names?
10849	J.D.	Oh. Nevermind.

10851	Elliot	Pukers!I gotta get this thing fixed.
10852	Janitor	Allow me! May I?Ah, yep. See, what you got here is a Medi-Com XJ. Got this hip-guard on it I'm guessing it's always, uh, coming loose?
10853	Elliot	It _is_ always coming loose!
10854	Janitor	I've been there; I've seen it; I fixed it. Without a try, missy.
10855	Elliot	Thank you!
10856	Janitor	Oh, for what? For doing my job? Come on! This kind of thing gets me up in the morning. That, and the smell of urinal cakes.Anyway, I'll see you around! Have a good one!
10857	Elliot	Back at'cha!
10858	J.D.	What are you smiling about?
10859	Elliot	Oh, I just made a new friend!

10861	Turk	This is so unfair of Kelso. Everyone has gotta have a way of taking the edge off! You and I, we've got basketball. Nurse Roberts, she's got her stories.
10862	Todd	Some guy named D.R.K. must love Miss PacMan, 'cause he's got the high score of 41 million.
10863	Turk	D.R.K.? Dr. Kelso!
10864	Todd	Ohh, Miss PacMan, I would sex that bow right off your head! Eat those dots, you naughty, naughty girl!
10865	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
10866	J.D.	Hey, Dr. Cox.
10867	Dr. Cox	Oh, hey, buddy! I was just thinking about you! Yeah, I was thinking how it might be real nice to have somebody around here who could help me out. You know, somebody I could call oh, gosh "My Resident"...and we'd do stuff together. You know, medical stuff. And it would just be peaches! But then it occurred to me that a guy who looked a hell of a lot like you used to be that guy.
10868	J.D.'s Thoughts	Just do it!
10869	J.D.	I'm sorry...did you say something?
10870	Pete	Welcome to today's lecture: The Biomechanical Reaction of Dr. Perry Cox When He's Not Being Listened To.
10871	Stage One	The jaw-clench. Arrrrrrrrggggggggghhhhhhhh!
10872	Pete	Quickly followed by Stage Two: Syllable elongation.
10873	Dr. Cox	Newbie, I re-he-heally don't have time to repeat myself!
10874	Pete	Finally, Stage Three: Dr. Cox begrudgingly offers a little respect, but then distances himself by overusing the word "there."
10875	Dr. Cox	But, I gotta give it to you, there, for yanking my chain, there. There!
10876	Pete	The young soldier is offered a prize for his courage.
10877	Dr. Cox	I'll tell you what, there, Newbie: If you want to stick around and help me out with Mrs. Riley's pericardiocentesis after work, that'd be great.
10878	J.D.'s Narration	I knew this was his way of reaching out, but still....
10879	J.D.	I have plans tonight.
10880	Dr. Cox	Oh, what plans!?
10881	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, think of something believable. Grandma died! No, no, no, no, don't do that...because if she does die, you'll feel awful; and, let's face it, she's no spring chicken. I should call her. But then, whenever we talk, I have nothing to say how 'bout asking me how I am for once!
10882	Dr. Cox	Newbie!
10883	J.D.	My grandma died!

10885	Carla	Hello, Mr. Hilliard.
10886	Mr. Hilliard	Hey.
10887	Carla	Just wanna make sure you're comfortable!
10888	Mr. Hilliard	Who are you?
10889	Carla	They call me Carla.
10890	Mr. Hilliard	Okay, Carla it is.
10891	Carla	Mr. Hilliard...
10892	Mr. Hilliard	Mm-hmm?
10893	Carla	Do I have something on my......lips?
10894	Mr. Hilliard	Nope! Totally clean.
10895	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
10896	J.D.'s Narration	I felt guilty about blowing off Dr. Cox to grab a beer with Pete. Of course, that was before we got Nancy as our waitress!
10897	Pete	Nancy, the kid's a doctor, for crying out loud! He saves lives! That's worthy of your respect, or at least one drunken weekend in Vegas.
10898	J.D.	Three-day weekend!
10899	Pete	Three-day weekend! Columbus day! That's coming up, right? Come on!
10900	J.D.'s Narration	Everyone deals with problems in their own way.Some lash out at others......some just end up lashing out at themselves......and some people just try to hide.
10901	Dr. Cox	Nancy! Nancy.
10902	J.D.'s Narration	Unfortunately, that never works.
10903	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
10904	J.D.	Hey, Dr. Cox? Look, I'm so sorry I lied to you last night. I should've just told you I was getting a beer with Pete.
10905	Dr. Cox	Did we just slip into some alternate dimension where I actually give a flying ducky about what you say and do?
10906	J.D.	Look, I know that he's in private practice and everything, but Pete's actually a really cool guy.
10907	Dr. Cox	He is a bad guy; and Newbie, if you're smart, you'll stay away from him.
10908	J.D.	Ohhh, my God! You're actually jealous that I'm hanging out with another doctor!
10909	Dr. Cox	No, I'm _not_.
10910	J.D.	Laverne?
10911	Nurse Roberts	Jealous!
10912	J.D.	Ta-DOW!
10913	Dr. Cox	Look, Marcia, if I were you, I'd drop this jealousy thing right now.
10914	J.D.	Don't worry about it, champ. It's all right to need me.
10915	Nurse Roberts	Touchdown!

10917	Elliot	Hi, Happy!
10918	Carla	I'm hideous. I can't even get Todd to make a sex joke. Watch this.Hey, Todd? I'm all out of the extra-long tongue depressors do you happen to have one for me?
10919	Todd	Sorry, Carla, I'm all out.
10920	Elliot	How did he not say, "Yeah, in my pants"?!?
10921	Carla	God! I don't know what is so different about me since I got engaged!
10922	Todd	Wait, I found one. It's not made of wood...but give me a minute!Hey, have you checked Mr. Oberman for hypertension?Because I've got hypertension right here!

10928	Dr. Kelso	Forty million, son! Do you have any idea how many patients I had to ignore to get that high score? People died!
10929	Turk	Well, what about me, sir? I need to play basketball. Now, come on, since you lost that stupid game, aren't you more stressed out than usual?
10930	Dr. Kelso	OPEN! OPEN, OPEN, OPEN!Maybe a little.
10931	Turk	So, what do we do now?
10932	Dr. Kelso	Now, this is how you relieve stress.DAMMIT TO HELL!

10934	J.D.	So you're saying the Janitor's a nice person?
10935	Elliot	He is such a sweetie!
10936	J.D.	I'm gonna ask him an innocuous little question, and his answer will be filled with hate. Just filled with it!How's it goin'?
10937	Janitor	Very well, sir! Thank you for asking! How are you?
10938	J.D.	Do you not see the hate?
10939	Elliot	What is wrong with you?
10940	J.D.	That was a good one.

10946	Pete	Okay, good answer. Look, uh, I understand you're seeing Jordan again I just wanted to tell you, seriously, good for you.
10947	Dr. Cox	Would you like to know what would be seriously good for you?
10948	Pete	More bran in my diet?
10949	Dr. Cox	No, how 'bout you never mention Jordan again.
10950	J.D.	Hey! Do you guys mind if I turn on CNN? My grandma bought me a stock I wanna see how it's doing.
10951	Pete	Look at Rockefeller! Pass me the remote, buddy!
10952	J.D.'s Thoughts	Cool! These guys are finally starting to get along!...Or not.
10953	Pete	No big deal! I'll, uh, you know, do one of these change the channel.
10954	J.D.	Or...we could just...leave it on this station....

10956	Carla	Mr. Hilliard, I like my body.
10957	Mr. Hilliard	Okay.
10958	Carla	I didn't always. I remember when I was ten years old, my swim coach telling me that my butt stuck out of the water too much. But now? I like it when my boyfriend looks at my wagon and goes "BAM!" you know? I'm okay with my curves! I realize women inject God-knows-what into their face to have lips like mine! Mr. Hilliard! I can hop out of the shower and look at my naked body for a whole ten seconds without totally losing it that's more than most women! But, still, when I can't make you fall asleep, it's like hearing my swim coach's voice all over again; and my body doesn't deserve that.
10959	Mr. Hilliard	So, what do you want me to do?
10960	Carla	Fall asleep.
10961	Mr. Hilliard	I'm not attracted to you!
10962	Carla	WHY!?!
10963	Mr. Hilliard	Because you remind me of my sister!
10964	Carla	But I'm _not_ your sister!That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
10965	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
10966	Dr. Cox	Had to be done.
10967	Pete	Okay! Terrific! Grown-ups tackle each other all the time.
10968	J.D.'s Narration	Watching Dr. Cox and Pete fight over me was aw, hell, I'll say it: It was awesome!
10969	Dr. Cox	You went ahead and took something that did not belong to you.
10970	J.D.'s Thoughts	That seemed a little possessive...but I'm flattered!
10971	Dr. Cox	And worse than that, you did it knowing full-well just exactly how I felt about her.
10972	J.D.'s Thoughts	Ahh, he just wouldn't be Dr. Cox if he didn't refer to me as a 'her.'
10973	Pete	Hey, for what it's worth, I didn't make the first move.
10974	J.D.	That's a lie! You bought me a latte!Hey, guys.
10975	Dr. Cox	We were having problems. Problems that you knew all about because I confided in you. And what did you do with the information? You used it to get Jordan into bed, didn't you. Didn't you!
10976	Pete	Perry, come on.
10977	Dr. Cox	Go.
10978	J.D.'s Narration	And, finally, the reason Dr. Cox and his wife got divorced became abundantly clear.

10980	Turk	Yes! Get in there!Say it!
10981	Dr. Kelso	I'm your bitch.

10983	Dave	Dr. Kelso, is this young man a guest of yours?
10984	Dr. Kelso	Dave, I've never seen him before in my life!
10985	Dave	Really?
10986	Turk	Dave.... Hey, man, you you you you don't gotta
10987	Dave	Oh, yeah, I do.Don't you run from me! Don't! Hey!

10993	Pete	Ohh, I get it, all right you're still in Perr-a-reeno's corner. But that's okay, buddy! Look, just a word to the wise, all right? Just be careful who you hitch your wagon to. I mean that. Yikes! I gotta go, okay?Hi! Could I buy you a house?
10994	J.D.'s Narration	I guess sometimes it comes down to loyalty.
10995	J.D.	Hey, Dr. Cox!
10996	Dr. Cox	Still no talking in the bathroom, Newbie.You know what's weird?
10997	J.D.	That you're allowed to talk?
10998	Dr. Cox	I never blamed Jordan. I was a chief resident, I was here all the time, and I always made damn-sure she knew she came second. But, God almighty, I'm trying harder this time. I just hope I'm doing the right thing, you know?
10999	J.D.'s Thoughts	Who cares if Jordan wants to keep it a secret? Tell him it's his baby! Scream it from the mountains!
11000	J.D.	DR. COX!
11001	Jordan	Oh, there you are!
11002	Dr. Cox	Hey, babe.
11003	Jordan	Hi, handsome. How are you?Oh! Hello, D.J.
11004	J.D.	Hey, Jordan. How' ya doin'?
11005	Dr. Cox	Oh!
11006	J.D.'s Narration	Around here, you have to grab hold of the littlest victories.Whether it's victories over your insecurities....
11007	Turk	Doc-Doc-Dr. Kelso?
11008	J.D.'s Narration	...or security's victories over you.
11009	Turk	Dr. Kelso!
11010	J.D.'s Narration	Either way, you gotta choose your battles.
11011	J.D.	I want you to tell her the truth, dammit. All right? Tell her that you're a surly, devious, horrible excuse for a human being!Who's that?
11012	Janitor	It's my son.
11013	Elliot	Oh, my God, J.D.!
11014	J.D.	I-I'm sorry. I di no, I didn't even see him there, I
11015	Janitor	No, no, no, I'm...I'm glad he heard it. I think it's important he sees how the world treats people like us.
11016	J.D.	I'm so sorry.
11017	Janitor	Who the hell are you? Go on, beat it.Scram!...All right, stick around.
11018	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11019	J.D.'s Narration	Maybe it's because spring is around the corner, but lately it feels like romance is in the air.
11020	J.D.	How's that?
11021	Turk	You close your eyes way too early. And you always go in right; you should try going in left the girls'll dig that.
11022	J.D.	Okay. Fo'shizzle. What's up, girl.
11023	Carla	Aw, there's nothing in life that dog could have done to deserve that.
11024	Turk	What you talking about? My man's single, he's just running drills to keep his stuff sharp. That's all.
11025	Carla	Ohhh.
11026	J.D.	Also, it would be super fantastic if you never mention this to anyone, ever.
11027	Turk	Are you crazy? You know she's gonna say something. We're talking about Carla, here!
11028	Carla	So now I'm a gossip?
11029	Turk	Yeah, you're a gossip! You gossip all the time!
11030	Carla	Since when?
11031	Turk	Since ever forever!
11032	Carla	To who?
11033	Turk	To everybody!
11034	J.D.'s Narration	It's weird, ever since they got engaged, Turk and Carla have been arguing constantly.
11035	J.D.	You want some kibble?
11036	J.D.'s Narration	I guess I always hoped that, the longer you're a couple, the easier it got....
11037	Jordan	No. Noise. And, by the way, the whole world gets it you love your body. Now put your damn shirt on; no one's making a calendar, here. Oh, and be a sweetie and get me a juice, will ya? Thanks so much.
11038	Dr. Cox	As much as it may seem like it to me, personally, I feel desperately compelled to remind you that we are in fact _not_ in prison. And I am just so not your bitch!
11039	Jordan	Watch your language in front of the baby!
11040	Dr. Cox	You're gonna have to trust me on this one: Seeing as you're his mother, he's gonna hear that word early, and he's gonna hear it often. Like...non-stop!
11041	J.D.'s Narration	Maybe the truth is that it's easier to be a new couple, because you can't really see what's ahead of you.
11042	Elliot	Tonight, I am going to make all of your fantasies come true.
11043	Paul	You know, Elliot, I would be happy just to have sex _above_ the covers once.
11044	Elliot	Yeah...never gonna happen. Now, follow my voice to the bedroom....over here!
11045	Paul	You're in trouble tonight!Oh! Oh! Oh, my God! Oh!
11046	Elliot	Don't take the blindfold off! I'll, uh, I'll get a towel to stop the bleeding!
11047	J.D.'s Narration	In the end, the safest thing for a couple is to find a routine and stick with it.
11048	Dr. Kelso	Ted, have you noticed how happy all the minions are lately?
11049	Lawyer	I wish I was dead.
11050	Dr. Kelso	Yep. People love working here! Good morning, sweetheart!
11051	Nurse	Ugh.
11052	J.D.'s Thoughts	Honestly, it all makes me glad I'm on my own. I really don't think I'd have it any other
11053	J.D.	Hello, ladies. Just window shopping, or would you like to try something on?
11054	Nurse	Uh, aren't you the guy that makes out with dogs?
11055	J.D.	Carla...a quick word?Is anybody else a doctor?
11056	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11057	Dr. Cox	I need you to extubate the young fellow in 304 and start an insulin drip on Mrs. Adler for the third time this month God bless diabetics who continue to drink oh, and Lassie! In response to the bestiality rumors circulating about you, I've decided to forgo calling you by the usual girl's name and instead I'm gonna be referring to you by whatever famous dog I can think of. I've gone with "Lassie" because, of course, that satisfies the criteria of being both a girl _and_ a dog's name, thus helping you ease into the transition.
11058	J.D.	I was just running kissing drills.
11059	Dr. Cox	Ohhh! That's completely normal, then!
11060	Nurse Roberts	Don't bring that filth over here.
11061	Turk	Dude! T.C.W.'s back.
11062	J.D.'s Narration	T.C.W. is a horrible story.She was married for three weeks before her husband got in a car accident and became a total vegetable. He's been on life support for the last two years; and since he was transferred to our hospital a month ago, she's visited every Wednesday. Very, very sad.Oh, yeah, and she's a babe! We call her "Tasty Coma Wife" or "T.C.W." for short.
11063	T.C.W.	How's he doing?
11064	J.D.	You know...he's he's the same. How are you doing?
11065	T.C.W.	Actually, I was just calculating how much time I need to spend here so I don't feel guilty all week.... And now I need to double it, because I can't believe I just said that.
11066	J.D.	I think you're allowed to do whatever you want, Mrs. Moyer.
11067	T.C.W.	Please, call me Jamie.
11068	J.D.	"Jamie"?
11069	Jamie	Mm-hmm.
11070	J.D.	Okay.
11071	Jamie	You have something on your cheek.
11072	J.D.	What is it?
11073	Jamie	Here.
11074	J.D.	Workin' in a hospital...it's always...something.
11075	Jamie	Yeah, I get it.
11076	J.D.	Oh. Did you get it?
11077	Jamie	No, not yet.
11078	Dr. Kelso	How we doin' today?
11079	J.D.	Oh! We're excellent, sir. No one going to hell in here!
11080	Dr. Kelso	Super!
11081	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11082	Turk	Baby. You've always known about my sleep toots. Hell, you used to imitate the sound they made, remember?
11083	Nurse Roberts	I make Mr. Roberts wear special air-tight boxer shorts.
11084	Turk	Laverne, I wrote the guest list for this conversation, and just in case, if you're wondering, you're not on it. Okay? So just umn-jun-humn.
11085	Dr. Cox	Hey, Carla, would you be good enough to take this young gentleman back to his room in Pediatrics? Apparently as a form of social protest, he chewed on and subsequently swallowed part of a Rolling Stones CD. I'll tell you what, there, Ralphie: They sold out for good once they started doing Ford commercials, you know what I'm saying?
11086	Ralphie	Hm?
11087	Carla	Mm-mm.
11088	Dr. Cox	We we'll talk later.
11089	Carla	Come on, Ralphie.
11090	Ralphie	I had that inside of me.
11091	Nurse Roberts	What, now?
11092	Carla	He's just making stuff up. Come on.
11093	Ralphie	I swallowed that ring, and my dad had to wait for me to go Number Two. And the black doctor gave me ten bucks to keep my mouth shut.
11094	Nurse Roberts	Mm. Good show today.

11096	Elliot	Ohhhh....
11097	Turk	Elliot! A blindfold! Way to step it up, Miss Nasty!
11098	Elliot	Hm. You told him what happened.
11099	Paul	We were bonding.
11100	Elliot	Mm...
11101	Paul	What are you eating?
11102	Elliot	Turkey jerky. Protein, baby! Go for it.
11103	Paul	Uh, no thanks.
11104	Elliot	You don't like jerky?
11105	Paul	I've never tried jerky.
11106	Turk	You've never tried jerky?
11107	Elliot	Well, jerky rocks.
11108	Paul	I won't like it.
11109	Elliot	You'll love it have one bite.
11110	Paul	Elliot, I've put a lot of thought into this, and I'm gonna have to pass.
11111	Elliot	Uh! Oh, so, eight stitches, and now you don't trust me.
11112	Paul	Elliot!
11113	Elliot	And you wanted above-the-covers sex.
11114	Turk	I feel your pain.
11115	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11116	J.D.'s Thoughts	Luckily, I'm a competent enough doctor that I'm not gonna let myself get distracted thinking about Jamie.
11117	Patient	Can you really hear my heart if it if it isn't in your ears?
11118	J.D.	Did _you_ go to med school?
11119	Patient	No, I...I...I No, I mean
11120	J.D.	No, you didn't. Thank you.
11121	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, the problem is that I'm in a rut. I just need someone to go out and get a beer with me.
11122	Elliot	I can't tonight!
11123	Lawyer	If I have more than one beer, I'll most likely kill myself.
11124	Carla	Can't. You seen Turk?
11125	Dr. Kelso	Married!
11126	Turk	Sorry, buddy, can't swing it tonight.
11127	J.D.	Oh, come on, player, just a few beers! And if we accidentally run into some skanky hos, then so be it!
11128	Jamie	I'll go.I totally need to blow off some steam. Plus, the best way to meet skanky hos is to already have a girl with you.
11129	J.D.	Not that I need any help.
11130	Turk	Pff! Hell no!
11131	J.D.	Heh.
11132	Turk	You got something right....
11133	J.D.	Oh?
11134	Turk	Yeah, yeah.
11135	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11136	Dr. Cox	Oh, my God. I gotta tell you about that day.
11137	Jordan	I can't believe I haven't named him yet. I've been calling him Monkey Face all day I think they would tease him at school.
11138	Dr. Cox	Seriously, Jordan, I had this one patient
11139	Jordan	He's got a boodgie the size of a grape in his nose. Would you run back to the hospital and get me one of those suctiony thingies?
11140	Dr. Cox	If I'm not back in twenty minutes, I don't want you to worry because it simply means I drove by a prostitute on the way home.
11141	Jordan	Oh, make sure it's a girl.
11142	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11143	Paul	Please don't do this.
11144	Elliot	Do what?
11145	Paul	The whole drama queen thing.
11146	Elliot	The jerky incident is exactly what is wrong with our relationship, Paul!
11147	Paul	Thank you.Ow! Every lunch, someone hits me with a spit-ball.
11148	J.D.'s Thoughts	I'm still not sure how I feel about Paul and Elliot.Uh-oh....
11149	J.D.	Nice day, huh?
11150	Janitor	You always gotta have something to say, don't ya? Old nosy nelly, always gotta throw his two cents in.
11151	J.D.	O...kay, I'm I'm sorry about the "nice day" thing. How can I make this right?
11152	Janitor	What's it, uh, biscuit and gravy day?
11153	J.D.	Yeah.
11154	Janitor	Just give me one of them biscuits.
11155	J.D.	I thought you were ready.
11156	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11157	Jamie	So, how does this whole wing-man thing work?
11158	J.D.	Okay, essentially, you have to think of yourself as chum, okay?
11159	Jamie	Okay.
11160	J.D.	And your job as chum is to lure attractive women closer to the boat.
11161	J.D.'s Thoughts	Mental note: "The Boat" could be a very cool new nickname.
11162	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11163	Jamie	Hey, baby! Would you like some of this?
11164	J.D.	All right.
11165	Jamie	Look at that mmm.
11166	J.D.	No, no, Jamie. A little
11167	Jamie	Yeah?
11168	J.D.	a little aggressive! Sorry.
11169	Jamie	Did you like her?
11170	J.D.	No, no, no.... Her ass was way too perfect.
11171	Jamie	I can't believe I'm actually having fun!
11172	J.D.	I'm glad!
11173	Jamie	So, "Tasty Coma Wife," huh?
11174	J.D.	Oh, yeah, I'm sorry; I've heard some idiots call you that.
11175	Jamie	I kinda like it.
11176	J.D.	I thought it up.
11177	Jamie	Cheers!
11178	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11179	Carla	Is this true!?
11180	Turk	Ralphie, I paid you ten dollars!
11181	Carla	This is disgusting!
11182	Turk	Why is it disgusting?
11183	Ralphie	Because it was in my butt!
11184	Turk	Ralphie, I'm dead serious: I want you to shut up! And you shut your mouth, now!
11185	Carla	Would you wear this!?
11186	Turk	Baby! Please! Look, I've had this steam-cleaned, like, three times! Not only would I wear it, I'll put it in my mouth.
11187	Carla	What?
11188	Ralphie	It's fun to eat things!
11189	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11190	Dr. Cox	Oh, ho, ho, ho, Scooby! A married woman whose husband is still in a coma? Hoo, hoo! Can't tell you how many happy couples I know who got started just that way.
11191	J.D.	Oh, will you relax...we just got a beer. Whatta you got there?
11192	Dr. Cox	One hundred free booger suckers and you'll say nothing.
11193	J.D.'s Narration	People in relationships are always quick to dole out advice, even though they're usually the ones that are messed up.
11194	Paul	See ya, Elliot.
11195	J.D.'s Narration	Whether they're considering breaking up over a Slim Jim......or having their stomach pumped...
11196	Turk	Ahhhhhhhh!
11197	J.D.'s Narration	...or just desperately trying to get some attention.
11198	Dr. Cox	Oh.
11199	J.D.'s Narration	So, I'm not gonna sweat it just because I made a new friend, you know? I mean, what's the big deal?
11200	Jamie	Hey!
11201	J.D.	Hey.
11202	Jamie	May I come in?
11203	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11204	J.D.	He likes you!
11205	Jamie	He must smell my dead dog.So, you still haven't asked me why I called the hospital, pretended to be your sister, got your home address, and showed up in the middle of the night.
11206	J.D.	Jamie, you've got a lot going on right now. I'm sure you're...a little confused....
11207	Jamie	It's time for me to start my life over. And I would love to take you out to dinner, if you would be interested.
11208	J.D.'s Thoughts	Holy crap!
11209	Jamie	Jack wouldn't want my life to be over.
11210	J.D.	Jack?
11211	Jamie	My husband.
11212	J.D.	Mr. Moyer!
11213	Jamie	Call him Jack.
11214	J.D.	I'd rather not.
11215	Jamie	I know it's weird. But give it some thought, okay?
11216	J.D.	Of course.
11217	Turk	Hey.
11218	Jamie	Hey!
11219	J.D.	Hey.
11220	Jamie	All right, I'll see ya.
11221	J.D.	Yeah.
11222	Turk	Dude! Was thatWas that Tasty Coma Wife?
11223	J.D.	Yeah....
11224	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11225	J.D.'s Thoughts	You'll figure out what to do. For God's sakes, you're The Boat!
11226	Jack	Here you go.
11227	J.D.	Oh, thanks, Jack.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
11228	Nurse Roberts	What?
11229	J.D.	Cold chart. Brrrrr! Heh.
11230	J.D.'s Thoughts	Good cover!
11231	Janitor	Five letters. "Showing vulnerability. 'A blank in one's armor'"...?
11232	J.D.	"Chink."
11233	Janitor	What?
11234	J.D.	"Chink!"Oh, no, no. No, Franklyn, we were we were, um, we were doing a crossword puzzle, and....
11235	Franklyn	I always suspected.
11236	Janitor	We all did.
11237	J.D.	Franklyn, no!
11238	Janitor	Wow. Tough break.
11239	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11240	Dr. Cox	Okay, Mrs. Brady, we're gonna try to break up your kidney stone with Lithotripsy. In the meantime, we're gonna put you on Percocet for the pain.
11241	Mrs. Brady	I can't take pain-killers Justin's still breast-feeding.
11242	Dr. Cox	Ohh, you like milk, do ya? Hah. Why don't you get on your bike and go down to the store and get some.
11243	J.D.'s Narration	I think at a certain point, breast-feeding becomes creepy.
11244	Mrs. Brady	You are such a little cutie.
11245	Justin	Mom, I'm trying to eat, here.
11246	Mrs. Brady	But
11247	Justin	Mom!
11248	Dr. Cox	Benji, come.What is with these mothers doting on their children? My God! It's like...it's like nobody else even exists in the world anymore! But I tell you one thing and you damn sure take it to the bank my mother never paid that much attention to me.
11249	J.D.	It doesn't show.
11250	Dr. Cox	Word to the wise, there, Astro: Sarcasm does not sit well with the Big Dog, so consider this a warning. Because the next time I hear you mumble some snarky little passive-aggressive aside, I'm going to look into your heart, pick out your greatest insecurity, and shine the world's brightest spotlight on it for the remainder of your natural-born days. Now, riddle me this, Fido: Just exactly why does every Asian person who's passing us by in the hallway, here, keep giving you the old stink-eye?
11251	J.D.	Oh, you're imagining things.
11252	Dr. Cox	Oh.
11253	J.D.	Ow.It's just been sorta hard for me lately, you know? I don't really have anyone special in my life, and...I'm pretty much either here or at home doing nothing, and....
11254	Jack	Yeah, that's rough.... I'm in a coma! I've had an itch on my foot for the last eight months!
11255	Elliot	What are you doing?
11256	J.D.	What? No nothing. It's a...new therapy.
11257	Elliot	Oh.J.D., you'd trust me on something that was important to me, right?
11258	J.D.	'Course.
11259	Elliot	See? That's what I'm looking for! Huh?
11260	Paul	Elliot! We're talking about dried meat, here! Why would you get in the middle of this?
11261	J.D.	I don't know what I was thinking.
11262	Paul	Is that a straw in your pocket?
11263	J.D.	No, this is just a...pen. "Pink scrubs"....
11264	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11265	Turk	Well, there it is all cleaned up for you; enjoy.
11266	Carla	Well, why don't you keep it...in case you get hungry later.
11267	Turk	Ohh, you think that's funny, huh, Ralphie? Pay me my ten dollars!
11268	Dr. Kelso	Son, a hospital staff is like a melting pot! We all need to respect each other. Now, if you think that a specific ethnic group is loud or lazy or sneaky....
11269	J.D.	Or ridiculously closed-minded and inappropriate....
11270	Dr. Kelso	Exactly! ...Just keep it to yourself, dammit!What?
11271	Janitor	Oh, nothing, sir. I just I thought of something funny.
11272	Dr. Kelso	Well, maybe what you should do instead is saddle up your mop and head upstairs someone has vomited in the second, third, and fifth floor hallways.
11273	J.D.	What? It's not my fault! Ralphie! Let's ride.Good work, buddy. Here's your twenty bucks. So you can really throw up whenever you want to?
11274	Ralphie	Hell, yeah!
11275	J.D.	We should probably look into that.... You know, right after you blow chunks in the elevator.
11276	Jamie	Hey, stranger!
11277	Ralphie	Hot!
11278	J.D.'s Thoughts	It's weird realizing that you missed someone you barely know.
11279	J.D.	Hey!Wait! Make me proud!
11280	Dr. Kelso	Good God!
11281	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11282	J.D.	I decided to take Jamie out on a date.
11283	Carla	Who?
11284	Turk	You know Tasty Coma Wife?
11285	Elliot	No way!
11286	Dr. Cox	Nice job, there, Hooch. I'll tell you what you give me a little prep time, and I'll rig it so that the husband can come with ya. Honest to God, I'll have him sittin' up right next to ya, no problemo. Whatta you say?
11287	Jack	I'm free, and I love Italian!
11288	J.D.	You be quiet!
11289	Carla	I can't believe you, Bambi!
11290	Turk	She is so right, man.
11291	Elliot	What are you thinking!?
11292	Dr. Cox	Oh, Rin-Tin-Tin-Tin-Tin-Tin-Tin!
11293	J.D.	Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! And shut up! Okay? Who are you people to give me advice about anything? All you do is just bitch about your relationships all day long!
11294	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11295	J.D.	Ugh!
11296	Nurse Roberts	Did I miss something good?
11297	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11298	Jamie	Thank you so much for dinner.
11299	J.D.	You're welcome.
11300	Jamie	But what was the deal with tipping twenty dollars on a thirty dollar bill?
11301	J.D.	Ah, nothing. I just I love Chinese food...and...the Asian people! What should we do now?
11302	Jamie	...Kiss me.
11303	J.D.	I could do that.
11304	Jamie	Mm! You went left! Very cool.
11305	J.D.'s Thoughts	Thank you, Rowdy!
11306	Jamie	So, it's cold outside you wanna come back to my place?
11307	J.D.	Uhh.... Honestly, I think you you might be moving a little fast for yourself. And there's a part of me that's very angry I just said that.
11308	Jamie	I'm so sick of being alone, you know?
11309	J.D.	I'll tell you what, if you look me in the eyes and you tell me that you're really ready to start something right now....we won't even need a cab I will, like, I will throw you over my shoulder and just sprint the twelve miles to your house!...But....
11310	Jamie	I'll call you sometime.
11311	J.D.	I hope you do.
11312	Jamie	Bye.
11313	J.D.'s Narration	I don't think people are meant to be by themselves.That's why, if you actually find someone you care about......it's important to let go of the little things....Even if you can't let go all the way.Because nothing sucks more than feeling all alone...no matter how many people are around.
11314	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11315	J.D.'s Narration	One thing that never changes around here is the stupid idea that the surgeons are all cool and the medical residents are all geeks.
11316	Elliot	Hey!
11317	J.D.	Ohhh, Rudy, can you lose the grapefruit goggles?
11318	Rudy	But it squirts in my eyes.
11319	J.D.	Well, that's a risk you take with that particular piece of fruit.You guys, come on! What do you say we dial down the whole power-nerd thing a little bit, okay?
11320	Elliot	Hey, J.D., are you starting your surgical elective tomorrow?
11321	J.D.	Ohh, is that tomorrow?
11322	Elliot	Yeah!
11323	J.D.	Whatever. I don't really give a crap.Take a picture! Take a picture!! And you better smile this time.
11324	Carla	You guys look so cute!
11325	J.D.	Hey, um, Carla, do you think you could cut these for me? Because I've been working out so much, these things are choking off my pythons , you know?
11326	Turk	Yeah, I wouldn't do that. At the end of the week, you gotta return these bad boys to, uh, Janeane!
11327	J.D.	Janeane's built like a bear. She curled me once.
11328	J.D.'s Narration	Entering the hospital as a surgeon has a whole different feel to it.
11329	Turk	Dude. You okay? You're acting weirder than the time we saw Pat Benetar at StarBucks.
11330	J.D.	How amazing was that morning....
11331	Turk	Listen, do me a favor: don't try to overdo it with these guys, all right? Just be you, okay?
11332	J.D.	Come on, man
11333	Turk	Be yourself.
11334	J.D.	you know how I do!What's up, fellas. Look, I know I'm usually Medical, I just want you guys to know I consider you all me pee-pees.
11335	J.D.'s Thoughts	They know you mean "peeps"! Just change the subject!
11336	J.D.	Whoa! Somebody's been working out!
11337	Surgeon	What?
11338	J.D.	Help me!
11339	Elliot	Dr. Cox
11340	Dr. Cox	Work! I hate you! You suck!
11341	Elliot	I know, but I've been trying harder lately
11342	Dr. Cox	Barbie: Talking to the computer. But nice self-esteem.
11343	Paul	Hey, cowboyhow 'bout you back off the little lady, and we'll all agree that you're really, really scary.
11344	Dr. Cox	Listen, there, Flowers: I know that your pink scrubs are balled up at the base of Barbie's bed three nights a week and congrats on that, really but if you're gonna go ahead and have a show-down with everyone who hassles her, then, gosh, you two aren't gonna have any time for that sweet, Aryan sex that you love so much!
11345	Elliot	Come on! Let's go!
11346	Dr. Cox	Why have we never fixed or replaced this monstrosity?
11347	Nurse Roberts	You know the deal around here if it barely works, it's not gonna get replaced.
11348	Dr. Cox	Well, I guess that explains why your ass is still on the payroll, huh? Ohhhhhhhhhhhh! Somebody stop me!
11349	Dr. Kelso	Morning, sport.
11350	J.D.	Morning, Captain.So, am I the first guy they've done this to?
11351	Turk	Nah, man! They did this to Frank Fratchman.
11352	J.D.	Who's Frank Fratchman?
11353	Turk	Okay, you're the first one.
11354	J.D.	Help me!
11355	Turk	Yeah.
11356	J.D.	Ow!
11357	Turk	All right, don't sweat it, okay? Stay on your toes.

11359	Dr. Cox	Sorry girls! Dropped my computer....yeah.
11360	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11361	Turk	You just gotta remember when surgical residents sense insecurity, they attack.
11362	J.D.	I'll watch out for that.
11363	Turk	Dude, your face. Your face.
11364	J.D.	Ohhhh, man!
11365	Turk	Yeah, let's lose the tail, too.
11366	J.D.	Huh! How did they get that on there, dawg?
11367	Turk	Buddy I got your back
11368	J.D.	Oooooo!
11369	Turk	but lay low for a while.
11370	J.D.	No problem. All right, people, how long till we get this thing started?
11371	Turk	Probably not for a few minutes.

11373	Elliot	Hey, should I file my Bel Biv Devoe CD under 'B' for "Bel Biv" or under 'D' for "Devoe"?
11374	Paul	You know, I don't know why you let Dr. Cox push you around like that.
11375	Elliot	Hey, do you notice that you're always telling me what to do? I mean, in a good way.
11376	Paul	Uh-uh!
11377	Elliot	Then, how come I'm growing my bangs out _and_ wearing a thong?
11378	Paul	Because you look better without the bangs. And the thong, well, that's not up to me that's the law, missy!
11379	Elliot	Yeah, not now. You know that I don't like kissing while I'm alphabetizing.
11380	Paul	Right. Just so you know, I'm not folding my clothes before we do it tonight.
11381	Elliot	Yes you are.
11382	Paul	Hey, Elliot, I just want to tell you that the last few weeks have been really, really amazing.
11383	Elliot	Thanks.I love U2.

11406	Turk	Told you I'd hook you up.
11407	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, my God.... Here, it's my first day in surgery, and I'm actually holding a human heart!
11408	J.D.	We we were done with that one, right guys?What'cha got there?
11409	Janitor	A new circular saw just bought it! Four horse-power, thirty-five hundred RPMs, titanium finger guard....
11410	J.D.	Why would you need a saw in a hospital?
11411	Janitor	Why would an old hen need a banjo?
11412	J.D.	Why _does_ an old hen need a banjo?
11413	Janitor	Why would I buy a saw if I didn't have stuff to cut?
11414	J.D.	You wouldn't! That'd be crazy.
11415	Janitor	Exactly!Need some help with that?
11416	J.D.	No thank you, I'm fine.

11419	Elliot	I was talking about U2, the _band_! You know what, it's fine. He probably thinks I was just saying it the way that you would say "I love eggs." You know, I'm sure there is not gonna be a problem.
11420	Carla	Okay!
11421	Lawyer	Uh, we have a telegram from Nurse Paul Flowers That name is funny!Uh, this is my band.

11445	Dr. Cox	I have...no words.
11446	Dr. Kelso	How about "handsome"? Or "glorious"?
11447	Dr. Cox	And this...abomination is the reason we can't afford a new computer?
11448	Dr. Kelso	Well, that, and a little medical boondoggle I have to go to in Cleveland. And by "medical boondoggle" I mean "golf weekend." And by "Cleveland" I mean "Hawaii."
11449	Dr. Cox	Do you have any idea what people around here think of you?
11450	Dr. Kelso	I go to bed some nights wondering. And you know what happens to me, Perry? I fall asleep and I mean like a log, brother. Anyway, I have to go catch my bus to the airport. And by "bus" I mean "helicopter."
11451	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11452	Paul	I'll be right back. Mr. Dunaway somehow managed to wet both his _and_ Mr. Spiller's bed.You're slouching.
11453	Elliot	Oh!
11454	Carla	You never explained that U2 thing, did you!
11455	Elliot	You know, I've been thinking about it, and maybe it's not such a bad thing that that happened! Right? I mean, things have been going really well between us, and maybe it was fate! I could've been looking at my Bel Biv Devoe CD and said, "I love Bel Biv Devoe" which I do, by the way. And I'm not ashamed of it.
11456	Carla and Elliot	"That girl is poison..."
11457	Carla	Elliot, look, I just think that if you guys are meant to get to this point, it'll happen...naturally.
11458	Elliot	You're right! "I love U2!" Dammit! Why do I always have to say every little thing that comes into my head!? Ugh, I really wish you wouldn't stand so close to me after you take your hummus break. See! I didn't need to say that!
11459	Paul	Love you!
11460	Elliot	Love you more!You know what brush your teeth, _then_ judge me, huh?
11461	Carla	Ew.

11463	J.D.'s Narration	I gotta say, it was nice to feel accepted.
11464	J.D.	Hey, dawg, remind me to burn that CD for you, all right, playah?Hey, you going to the weight room later? I might be able to get you two tickets!
11465	Doc	To what?
11466	J.D.	To the gun show, dawg!Heeeeeeeeey!
11467	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes you just can't help but get caught up in the moment. And when that happens, you never know what you're gonna do.
11468	Nurse	What's that all about?
11469	Dr. Cox	Oh, I'm afraid Dr. Kelso has passed away.
11470	J.D.'s Narration	...Or what you're gonna say to someone.
11471	Paul	I can't wait for my parents to meet you.
11472	Elliot	Me neither.
11473	J.D.'s Narration	But if things are going well, you should just ride the wave.
11474	J.D.	Hey, T-Dog! Who we slicing and dicing today?
11475	Turk	Well, J-Dog, I don't know who you're slicing and dicing I assigned you to another surgeon.
11476	J.D.'s Thoughts	What? Why?
11477	Band	You deserve Ted's Band today / So get up and get away....
11478	J.D.	Ted!
11479	Ted	To
11480	J.D.	You guys suck.
11481	Band	Boing-fwip!
11482	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11483	J.D.'s Thoughts	So what if Turk switched me to another surgeon. I can't worry about that now I'm here to learn.
11484	Todd	J.D., are you even paying attention?
11485	J.D.	Oh, I'm sorry, Todd. Is it time to excise the tumor?
11486	Todd	No! It is time to realize that we are operating on a naked chick! We will high-five later!
11487	J.D.'s Narration	And then I realized why Turk was so pissed he was the geek now.
11488	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11489	Carla	You're gonna get in so much trouble for this.
11490	Dr. Cox	It's a joke! No one's gonna believe that Kelso actually died!

11492	Todd	I don't know if I should be alone tonight.
11493	Nurse	Ugh!
11494	Lawyer	Hah-hah-hah-hah!
11495	Nurse Roberts	He's with Jesus, now. Tough break, Big Guy.

11499	J.D.	Hey, Turk! Turk! Wait, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait! Look, I can totally get you back in with all the surgery boys.
11500	Turk	Oh, can you? Really? Totally?
11501	J.D.	Yeah, man! I'll just talk to 'em. You know, Shmitty, Schultzy, Trigger, Fig-sack, Small Pete, Little Pete, Tiny Pete, The Jackal, Aardvark, and Steve!
11502	Turk	Dude, who the hell are you talking about?
11503	J.D.	Oh, yeah, we all went out last night, and I sorta made up some new nicknames for all the fellas. By the way, you're "Slappy-bag."
11504	Turk	You've lost it.
11505	J.D.	Come on! Slappy-bag!
11506	Turk	Don't call me "Slappy-bag"!
11507	J.D.	Told ya you had nothing to saw.
11508	Janitor	Oh, really?
11509	J.D.	Oww, man! Give it back!
11510	Janitor	All right. Just tell me why you're hitting yourself.Hm? Why you doing that?You ever get the feeling we're thinking the same thing?
11511	J.D.	No!

11513	Paul	Hey, slow down on that brie! You know what cheese does to you!
11514	Elliot	Yet another good tip!
11515	Paul	You know, I've been thinking a lot about us lately.
11516	Elliot	Me too.
11517	Paul	God, you drive me crazy.
11518	Elliot	Oh, you drive me crazy!
11519	Paul	Sometimes I just lay awake at night, thinking about how unbelievably lucky I am to have you in my life.
11520	Elliot	Sometimes you're so controlling it makes me want to strangle you.Oh! Ow! My nose!
11521	Paul	Elliot, are you trying to break up with me?
11522	Elliot	Sorry, um, cheese.

11524	Maintenance Man 1	Yo, coming through.
11525	Dr. Cox	Holy cow! Whatta you fellas just clean out a guy's office the second he goes deady-bye?
11526	Maintenance Man 2	We can come back later.
11527	Dr. Cox	No, no. No. No. The quicker all of these memories are removed, the sooner all of us can get on with our lives.
11528	Maintenance Man 3	There's no way this desk is fitting through that door.
11529	Janitor	I got it.
11530	Dr. Cox	Who're you?
11531	Janitor	Just a man...with a saw.

11533	J.D.	Mmggh....ten! Careful with that.
11534	Surgeon	I think I can manage.
11535	Turk	That's a great set, Arnold. You got a little stringy thing hanging from your sleeve, there. Oh, I'm sorry that's your arm!
11536	J.D.	Look, I'm sorry I told all the surgeons about your ballet thing.
11537	Turk	I don't give a crap what these clowns think, man! Todd camped out in a full-on wizard outfit to see the last Harry Potter movie.
11538	Todd	Dude! You swore you wouldn't tell! We even high-fived on it!
11539	Turk	Todd, we high-five on everything.
11540	Todd	That's such a lame excuse! I'm totally pissed at you!High-five!
11541	Turk	You were so desperate for the approval of all these stupid surgeons that you sold me down the river, huh?
11542	J.D.	Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah? Not all surgeons are stupid, okay! Think-sack, here, went to Dartmouth!Oh, wait, you're Aardvark.
11543	Surgeon	Mm-mm.
11544	J.D.	Smitty?
11545	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11546	Dr. Cox	Hey, Bob-Cat, welcome back. Lookit, this whole thing was a joke that...admittedly got a little out of hand. And, in the meantime, this blank check oughtta cover the damage.
11547	Dr. Kelso	A _joke_? You think it's funny they already gave away my parking spot? You think it's funny that one of the surgeons paid his dwarf cousin, Lance, two-hundred dollars to show up at rounds and sing, "Ding-dong, Kelso's dead!"?
11548	Dr. Cox	And there it is.
11549	Dr. Kelso	There what is!?
11550	Dr. Cox	This whole "I don't care what people think about me" act? It's pretty convincing. But methinks there's a sad little cartoon boy living inside the hairy beast. And he's sad because, at the end of the day, he realizes that the only thing people think about is what an evil son-of-a-bitch he really is. See you later, Bobbigator.
11551	Dr. Kelso	Hey!If this check bounces, I'm coming for you!How you doin', Ted.
11552	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11553	Paul	Okay, here's what you do: First you say that, even though our relationship is ending, you don't have any regrets.
11554	Elliot	Oh, my God! Are you actually telling me how to break up with you?
11555	Paul	You're right. Go ahead.
11556	Elliot	If you could just start me off, that'd be super.
11557	Paul	Just tell me we had a lot of fun together.
11558	Elliot	We did.
11559	Paul	And most of the time, you were really happy.
11560	Elliot	I was.
11561	Paul	And then say that you wished you were mature enough to sit down and talk to me about what was bothering you. 'Cause, even though I can be controlling sometimes, I really would've worked on it for someone as special as you.
11562	Elliot	You know, it's funny...when I said "I love you," it was an accident and I never really loved you at all.
11563	Paul	That is an absolute riot.
11564	Elliot	No. No, I just mean that, I wonder how things would've gone if that had never happened.
11565	Paul	Me too.

11567	Woman	Hi! Can I buy you a drink?

11570	Bartender	No problem, lady.
11571	J.D.	Man! Ever since college, you always make everything seem so easy. No matter where you are, you always fit in. I dunno, I guess I thought with this surgery elective, it might be nice not to feel like a total dork for once.
11572	Turk	J.D., look at me. You are a dork.
11573	J.D.	Not all the time!
11574	Turk	Every second, since the moment I met you.
11575	J.D.	Hey, I'm J.D.! I'm so stoked to be your roommate! Right on!
11576	Graduation	To go along with his cap and gown, J.D. has gotten his ear pierced with a huge gold ring.
11577	J.D.	What are you talking about? I thought you said hoops were cool? Hey, baby! Cham-pahg-nee?Med school chicks love ventriloquists!
11578	Puppet	He's right! They do!
11579	Hospital	J.D. is orange.
11580	J.D.	Tannest intern, baby! And it comes in a bottle!
11581	Bar	A few minutes ago.
11582	J.D.	Apple-tini, please. Easy on the -tini.
11583	Turk	See, J.D., the thing that I always liked about you was that you were just yourself you never cared about what people thought.
11584	J.D.	And that's why you hung out with me?
11585	Turk	No, you had a car. Still do.
11586	J.D.	Come on, player! You know I'm way more stud than dud!Wow, you can really taste the apples!
11587	J.D.'s Narration	I think everyone would like to believe it's possible to become someone different.... To change how people see us.
11588	Dr. Cox	Haha! I told you he'd buckle! How's that new computer? Pretty good, huh?
11589	Carla	We wouldn't know this one's from, like, 1970.
11590	Dr. Cox	Well, what'd he do with the new one?
11591	J.D.'s Narration	But sometimes change doesn't last for long.
11592	Dr. Kelso	By golly, you're so pretty, I may not even use you!
11593	J.D.'s Narration	And other times, just makes you miss what you had....a little.As for me, I'm happy just knowing who I am.
11594	Doug	Hey, J.D.? Do you have any nasal spray?
11595	J.D.	No problem, Dougster.

11604	Dr. Cox	What's the matter? Are you getting all sore around that hump above your butt where your tail used to be?
11605	Jordan	I'm going 'cause when Gustavo promises me something will feel great and last an hour, he doesn't end up in the shower five minutes later thinking he made me see God!
11606	Dr. Cox	So not Gustav! Busy doctor!
11607	J.D.'s Thoughts	I think Dr. Cox would be more willing to help if he knew it was his baby.
11608	Baby	Whatta you say, there, Stephanie; how about _you_ step up to the plate and tell the guy. My God! I'm only three weeks old, and already I've got more stones than you do and one of mine hasn't even dropped yet.
11609	J.D.	It's not my place to tell!
11610	Baby	Wah! Wah! Wah!
11611	Dr. Cox	Newbie, I know that your ovaries are absolutely tingling at the very sight of this little fella, but you gotta snap out of it!
11612	J.D.	Oh, I gotta get to that funeral.
11613	Dr. Cox	Well, raise my rent if you're not off to see Tasty Coma Wife, aren't you! Her husband was in a coma so long, that she actually forgot what an attractive male looked like enter Errol Flynn...whose conscience will not allow him to either swash or buckle her. But, since hubby is now worm food, I'm guessing all bets are off? Mm-hmm?
11614	Jordan	Listen, later on, if you have trouble getting the baby to sleep? Just tell him that story. Yeah.
11615	J.D.	Well...I'm gonna get going.
11616	J.D.'s Narration	Luckily, no one else'll bust my chops about the funeral. Because around here, you tend to get wrapped up in your own world.Whether you're trying to plan your day...
11617	Todd	Should I take a dookie before or after I lift weights? Mmmm....after!
11618	J.D.'s Narration	...or trying to live out your deepest fantasies.
11619	Janitor	Dammit! Don't you die on me! Clear! Kgh-bgghhhh!
11620	J.D.'s Narration	...Maybe you're trying to break in the soles of your new Italian shoes...
11621	Lawyer	Sir, those shoes look a little small for you.
11622	J.D.'s Narration	...or break down the spirit of your old whipping boy.
11623	Dr. Kelso	What do you know about appearances, Ted? Have you looked in a mirror?
11624	Lawyer	Not lately. But when I do, it's reflection perfection!
11625	J.D.'s Narration	One way or another, everyone finds a way to make it all about themselves.
11626	Nurse Roberts	I gotta fix my own damn copy machine 'cause the maintenance man claims he's got more important things to do!
11627	J.D.	Isn't he fixing the heat down in Pediatrics?
11628	Nurse Roberts	Whatever!
11629	J.D.'s Narration	As for me, no matter what Dr. Cox thinks, I wasn't going to that funeral to hit on Jamie.......I was going to pay my respects.
11630	Jamie	J.D.! I'm so happy you came!
11631	J.D.	Well, you look fantastic! And, you know, I don't mean "Hey, dude, check out that hot bitty at the bar!" 'fantastic' I'm talking about "I'm sorry for your loss" 'fantastic'.
11632	Jamie	Do you wanna grab a drink?
11633	J.D.	Yeah, let's get the hell out of here.
11634	Jamie	Oh, I was actually talking about him.
11635	J.D.	Oh, yeah, I know! So so was I.
11636	Jamie	Oh, no! You have to order he's bussing those.

11652	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, she's probably feeling awful, so say something reassuring.
11653	J.D.	You're going to hell.
11654	Jamie	J.D., we've been over this. I loved my husband, but he's been dead to me for two years. I mean, I can't tell you how happy I am to finally have some closure. ...And my first orgasm in, like, forever!
11655	J.D.	You know, Jamie, there are a lot of ways to grieve. Um.... But, last time I checked, wheelbarrow-style wasn't one of them.
11656	Jamie	I am okay, J.D. I'm really seeing things clearly.
11657	J.D.	You've never been more confused.
11658	Jamie	I'm happy!
11659	J.D.	You're sad.
11660	Jamie	I'm at peace.
11661	J.D.	You're at war!

11664	Jordan	All right, I will see you at home in about an hour. Remember to keep him warm, support his head, check his diaper every fifteen minutes; no bouncing around, no loud noise, no TV, no poking the soft spot. And, Perry, you're the only one in my life that I actually have to say this to: Do not yell at, demean, insult, criticize, humiliate, or mock the baby.
11665	Dr. Cox	What are you talking about?Waaaah! Now, have you bothered to name this thing yet?
11666	Jordan	I'm thinking of naming him after my father.
11667	Dr. Cox	"Tax E. Vader"?
11668	Jordan	Quinn.
11669	Dr. Cox	What about a heterosexual name, like Jack?
11670	Jordan	You're right, Percival, "Quinn" is a foofy name.
11671	Dr. Cox	You know what, skip "Jack" altogether and just go with whatever you think is right whatever makes you comfortable.Jack-Jack-Jack-Jack-Jack-Jack-Jack-Jack-Jack...Jack!Nothin', huh? Aye-aye-aye.Oh!My God, this is so boring!

11682	Elliot	What's her problem? I'm starting to wonder if my prescription deodorant isn't working!
11683	Turk	Mm?
11684	Elliot	It's not for the odor, it's for the wetness. See!
11685	Turk	Whoa! Woman! Don't touch me!
11686	Elliot	You're right. I have got to stop touching my pits and rubbing them on people.
11687	Turk	Yes, you do! Still, it's not that.... I sorta had a sex dream about you.
11688	Elliot	Really?
11689	Turk	Yeah.
11690	Elliot	Was I the girl?
11691	Turk	Yeah, you were the girl! Can you just do me a favor, though? Don't tell Carla about this, because she'll just get all jealous and disgusted.
11692	Elliot	But...we haven't done anything for her to be disgusted by.
11693	Turk	Oh, yeah, we did.

11695	J.D.'s Thoughts	I'm gonna try not to call Jamie, because I know in my heart she shouldn't be in a relationship yet. But still, there were a lot of questions: Was she gonna be okay? Did I leave my underwear at the funeral home? And good Lord! how did I end up in the middle of nowhere without realizing I've never had to pee this badly in my entire life!?
11696	J.D.	Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.Uh! Oh!Oh, my God!Oh. My. God.
11697	Dr. Cox	So, you caught sight of the Janitor's window crank, and think you may have seen a little melanoma on there? Hmm! Well, then, it's your obligation as a doctor and your privilege as a woman to go back and ask him if you can't see it one more time. Now, 'course I'd love to help, but I'm off to baby-sit the only other being on God's green earth who's needier than you. And, in the meantime, I need you to go in and tell Mr. Mueller that his liver has lesions on it and it doesn't look good.
11698	J.D.'s Narration	Unfortunately, Mr. Mueller doesn't speak a word of English.

11731	J.D.'s Thoughts	This is perfect! In here, I can just "accidentally" see his wiener and then give him medical advice! Just be subtle.
11732	Janitor	Can I take your order?
11733	J.D.	How come you're not unzipped?
11734	Janitor	'Cause I'm not peeing! This is where I come to take my breaks. If I stand around out there, everyone tells me to do stuff.
11735	J.D.	Look, uh..........JanitorI'm gonna be straight with you: I saw your penis, and I noticed a possible melanoma that you should really have checked out.
11736	Janitor	When did you see my penis?
11737	J.D.	Last night, when you were showering.
11738	Janitor	Where were you?
11739	J.D.	Oh, I was outside, in the bushes.
11740	Janitor	Uhhh....
11741	J.D.	Look, it was just a coincidence, man I mean, i-i-if you had looked out the window, you'd have seen my penis, you know!
11742	Janitor	What!?! Why?
11743	J.D.	Because I had it out while I was looking at yours!
11744	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, regroup.
11745	Hermann	Hey, you must be Dr. Dorian. I am, uh, Rolf's brother, Hermann.
11746	J.D.	Hermann the German! You must get that all the time!
11747	Hermann	No, first time....
11748	J.D.	Oh.
11749	Hermann	Let's hope it catches on!
11750	J.D.	Uh, well, uh, I could really use your help translating.
11751	Hermann	Oh, sure.
11752	J.D.	Uh, I got the, uh, results back from your biopsy...
11753	Hermann	Wir werden dich zu einem...
11754	J.D.	...the lesions in your liver...
11755	Hermann	Es sieht so aus, als ob du...
11756	J.D.	...are... consistent with metastatic pancreatic cancer.
11757	Hermann	...metastatic und pancreatic Krebs du hast.

11759	Mr. Mueller	Was ist denn meine Prognose?
11760	Hermann	Eh, what is the prognosis?
11761	J.D.	It's not good.
11762	Hermann	Es wird alles gut gehen.Okay.
11763	J.D.'s Narration	The key to any good relationship is communication.
11764	Carla	Hi, Baby.
11765	Turk	Hey!
11766	J.D.'s Narration	If you're not open with someone, it's gonna catch up with you.
11767	Patient	This is so weird I could swear that while I was in surgery, I heard you describing these sexy dreams about someone named Elliot!
11768	J.D.'s Narration	If you're not honest, you'll end up getting busted.
11769	Dr. Cox	So, to summarize: If this basketball was a non ST-elevation myocardial infarction, Glycoprotein 2B3A inhibitors would be initiated early on....You buying this?
11770	Jordan	No. Can I see that?
11771	J.D.'s Narration	Eh, but what do I know about good relationships? Two days ago, I had funeral sex.
11772	Elliot	Hey! I just met your patient, Mr. Mueller; we had such a nice chat.
11773	J.D.	You speak German?
11774	Elliot	Yeah! I can do a sweet little milkmaid: Guten Morgen, möchten Sie die Kühe melken?I can do an evil old hausfrau : ESS DEIN SCHNITZEL, SONST KRIEGST DU KEIN NACHTISCH! J.D.: German's such a beautiful language.... Anyhoo, I think Mr. Mueller's so amazing. I mean, yesterday, I pretty much told him he was gonna die; and his brother turned to him and he said, "Es wird alles wieder gut." And Mr. Mueller just accepted it!Well, why wouldn't he? "Es wird alles wieder gut" means "You're going to be fine."
11775	J.D.	Germans!
11776	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11777	Mr. Mueller	Sobald ich nach Hause komme, werde ich eine ganze Schokoladentorte essen!!
11778	J.D.	Please tell me he just said, "My brother told me the truth, and I'm dealing with it the best that I can."
11779	Elliot	He said, "As soon as I get home, I'm eating an entire chocolate cake."
11780	J.D.	You mind telling me why you lied to your brother about this ____ condition!?
11781	Hermann	You you talk too fast.
11782	Elliot	He said,He didn't want to upset his brother, jackass!
11783	J.D.	Fine, just tell him that lying to his brother isn't gonna make him any better!
11784	Nurse Roberts	We got Mr. Mueller's ultrasound back.
11785	J.D.	His Biliary obstruction's relieved, and he's taking P.O.
11786	Hermann	That's good, yes?
11787	J.D.	Da!
11788	Elliot	Ja.
11789	Hermann	Ah!
11790	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11791	Dr. Kelso	Ted, I need you to crunch the numbers on next year's budget.
11792	Lawyer	Sir, that would be a job for the accounting department I'm an attorney.
11793	Dr. Kelso	Uh-huh, and speaking of crunching, I have been jonesing for some Double-Stuff Oreos all day. Why don't you see if you can't hook me up?
11794	J.D.	...And now, Mr. Mueller's doing so much better, I'm not even sure telling him the truth about his pancreatic cancer is even the best thing for him.
11795	Dr. Cox	So, what you're saying is that you have a problem that is totally your problem, but you'd like to find a way to make that problem my problem. But here's the problem, Newbie: it's not my problem. So whatta you say we stop talking about the Janitor's junk; I'd like to hear nahsing about ze German; and don't even mention Tasty Coma Wife, even though I know she's on your mind.
11796	J.D.	No she's not!
11797	Jamie	Yes I am!Waaagh!
11798	Dr. Cox	Well, since we are sharing: I have to go home and face Jordan and tell her that I didn't ditch her little hatchling on account of being lazy I did it because, whenever I'm alone with that child, do you know what I feel? Nothing.
11799	J.D.	No thanks.
11800	Dr. Cox	It was worth a try.
11801	Nurse Roberts	What was that about?You're right, I'm sorry! I've been working really hard the past few months on not being such a busy-body.
11802	Carla	So, tell me, Turk, was she a good kisser?
11803	Turk	Uhhh....
11804	Nurse Roberts	Excuse me.
11805	Carla	Turk! If you're already having dreams about another woman, maybe you're not ready for marriage!
11806	Turk	Baby....
11807	Carla	Just take it!Are you crazy!? Baby, it was only a sex dream! Everybody has them......right, Ted?
11808	Lawyer	Oh, no, not me...I just have the one dream over and over I hold his head under the water 'til that last bubble goes "bloop."
11809	Dr. Kelso	Ted! What's the E.T.A. on those Double-Stuffs?
11810	Lawyer	Bloop.
11811	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11812	J.D.	Okay. Uh, I still want to refer you to a dermatologist, but it looks benign to me.
11813	Janitor	Benign...be nine and a half....
11814	J.D.'s Narration	And then he said something I never expected to hear.
11815	Janitor	I don't like you.
11816	J.D.'s Narration	Not that I totally expected that.
11817	Janitor	...But, I know this was uncomfortable, and, uh, I appreciate your concern.
11818	J.D.	I'm a doctor. I had to tell you what was going on.
11819	Janitor	Don't touch me with those hands.

11821	Elliot	This is awkward.
11822	Turk	Yeah, Elliot, could you, uh, be quiet please?
11823	Elliot	Okay. But if it gets too quiet, you could just fall asleep, and then I might just creep into your head and rock your world! Unh!
11824	Turk	Elliot, you don't get it, do you? Look, ever since I met Carla, I haven't dreamt about another woman.
11825	Elliot	Turk! You're engaged. I mean, it's a huge commitment! It's totally natural to feel trapped or uncertain...maybe even a little scared?
11826	Turk	Really?
11827	Nurse Roberts	Uh-huh.Sorry.
11828	Turk	Baby?
11829	Carla	Yeah?
11830	Turk	Have you dreamt of anyone since we got engaged?
11831	Carla	No, Baby, but I understand. Come here, let me give you something to dream about.
11832	Lawyer	See if you can find my tattoo!
11833	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11834	Dr. Cox	Hey, Jordan.
11835	Jordan	You know, it's funny I can't even be pissed and want you to die, screaming in agony, as two horses pull you apart when I'm looking at this beautiful face.
11836	Dr. Cox	Jordan, I gotta...I gotta tell you something.
11837	Jordan	You know, I love my dad, but he just doesn't look like a "Quinn."
11838	Dr. Cox	Maybe that's because he's not drunk and yelling at your mother.
11839	Jordan	What are you? A "Kevin"? A "Billy"?
11840	Dr. Cox	Jack?
11841	Jordan	Wow. All right. Jack it is. What the hell! All right, you take him.So, what did you want to tell me?
11842	Dr. Cox	Nothing.... Nothing.
11843	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11844	J.D.	"...Davor schützen..."
11845	Mr. Mueller	So ist mein Bruder...
11846	Elliot	"Just like my brother..."
11847	Mr. Mueller	...denkt immer, er weiß was besser für mich ist.
11848	Elliot	"...always thinking he knows what's best for me."
11849	J.D.'s Narration	It's funny how one person can lead you to another. I mean, I knew Mr. Mueller's brother shouldn't have tried to protect him, and yet I was doing the same thing to someone else.
11850	J.D.	Excuse me, Jamie?
11851	Jamie	J.D.? Wha ?
11852	J.D.	I treated a patient today who was mad at his brother for presuming to know what's best for him. And that got me thinking. Because I was freaking out that we hooked up in the closet at the funeral, I did the same thing to you! So...if you're really ready, let's go for it! 'Cause, I'm crazy about you, and you're right your husband's gone, and he's never coming back!
11853	Man	Uhh.
11854	J.D.	Who are these lovely people?
11855	Jamie	These are my late husband's parents.
11856	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, God. How can I make this right?If only....
11857	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11858	J.D.'s Thoughts	When you're dating a woman whose husband just died after two years in a coma, you can't help but have doubts about the relationship. I guess all you can do is be a man, and face those doubts head-on.
11859	Jamie	What are you thinking about?
11860	J.D.	Eggs. You know, one minute they're bad for you, now everybody's like, "Hey, have you tried eggs? Th-They-They're great!" It's c it's crazy. Every ...eggs are....
11861	Jamie	You know what? Forget I asked.
11862	J.D.	What?
11863	Jamie	J.D., I really wanted tonight to be romantic.
11864	J.D.	Sweetie, it is!Now, exactly how much feeling am I supposed to lose in my extremities?
11865	Jamie	Just enough so it still hurts.
11866	J.D.'s Narration	Still, things are going pretty well with me and Jamie.
11867	Elliot	Looks like rope-burn to me.
11868	J.D.	Oh, no, this a a rash from my new watch. They didn't tell me the band was made out of....cat.
11869	Carla	Elliot, check out these wedding dresses.
11870	Turk	I am _so_ proud of you right now!
11871	Elliot	This is exactly like the dress I bought! Huh!
11872	J.D.	Hm?
11873	Elliot	Oh, I I didn't already buy a wedding dress. I mean, I'm not even dating anybody, so that would be crazy.... Whether it was half-off or not....
11874	Turk	Dude, there's not one good thing about her planning a wedding I can't afford.
11875	Carla	Turk, I know it's silly and I know it's only for one day but ever since I was a little girl, all I wanted to do was have a big, beautiful wedding.
11876	Turk	Baby! What's the name of that designer you love so much? She made that gown? Vera...
11877	Carla	"Wang."
11878	Elliot	Oh, my God. You're the only two doctors immature enough to laugh at the name "Vera Wang."
11879	Todd	Hello.
11880	Elliot	Go ahead.
11881	Todd	What? I think Vera Wang makes very beautiful gowns. Plus, her last name is a very funny word for "penis." Who's with me? Air-five! Stsh! Stsh! Stsh!
11882	J.D.	Shorts, huh?
11883	Janitor	Yeah. What, I don't get to wear shorts, 'cause I'm just a lowly janitor?
11884	J.D.	I didn't say "lowly."
11885	Janitor	Oh, so now I'm a janitor?
11886	J.D.	Yes! Have you been drinking?
11887	Janitor	I'm not _drunk_.
11888	J.D.	I love your shorts, okay? I wish I had a pair just like 'em.
11889	Janitor	Hm.
11890	Dr. Cox	Okay, Mr. Westfeld, now the angioplasty went well, but here's the thing: It is on you, pardner. You gotta start watching what you eat so that we can kick this thing in the ass. Okay?
11891	J.D.	It's on you, pardner!
11892	Dr. Cox	Oh, gosh, Shannon, thank you _so much_ for clarifying my point by repeating it word for word. And now, in a reciprocal gesture, can I be included in the planning of your coming out party?
11893	J.D.	Is that a gay joke?
11894	Dr. Cox	No, it's a cotillion joke. My God, Newbie, it's been two furiously frustrating years how is it possible that you still don't get me? I would never compare you to the gays! I like the gays I like their music, I like their sense of style, I especially like what they've done with Halloween but _our thing_ is that you are a _little girl_. That's who you are! But that's really not fair....
11895	J.D.'s Thoughts	Man, once Dr. Cox gets on a roll, there's nothing that can derail him.
11896	Dr. Cox	....is just impossible.
11897	Carla	My mom died.
11898	J.D.'s Thoughts	Except that.
11899	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11900	Carla	Thank you all for coming, I know you're busy.
11901	J.D.'s Narration	The toughest part about working in a hospital is that, no matter what else is going on in your life, you have to dive right back into the middle of things.
11902	Janitor	So, anyway, you said you liked mine, and I had the wife whip you up a pair of your own! You like 'em?
11903	J.D.	Do I like 'em? Why, just the other day, I was asking myself, "How can I display my package in a way that's both alluring and professional?"
11904	Janitor	Well, there's your answer!
11905	J.D.	Ugh.
11906	Janitor	HAH-HAH-HAH! Ahhh! To be young and in shorts!
11907	Jamie	Are you ready for bed?
11908	J.D.	Oh, I'm ready.
11909	J.D.'s Narration	A lot can change in a week.
11910	Jamie	Scoot.Can you hand my mouth guard to me?
11911	J.D.'s Thoughts	Uh, ew.
11912	Jamie	Thanks.
11913	Elliot	J.D., if things have fizzled that much, I mean, I could scout her out for you, try to figure out the problem.
11914	J.D.	Things haven't fizzled, all right? Last night we made ice cubes out of orange juice, so step off!
11915	Lawyer	Okay, gang! Before we begin, Dr. Kelso wants me to remind you of the legal ramifications of all your teensy snafus.
11916	Dr. Kelso	"Teensy snafus"?!? Good God, Ted, it's not a Dr. Seuss story!
11917	Doug	It was a gusher!
11918	Dr. Kelso	Next catastrophe. ...Idiots!

11922	Nurse Roberts	Dr. Cox, would you like to try one of my world-famous deviled eggs?
11923	Dr. Cox	No, thank you, I've already had diarrhea....It's always tough when you have to bury your own mom, isn't it?
11924	Carla	Mm-hmm. What was your mother's funeral like?
11925	Dr. Cox	Wouldn't know skipped it. But my aunt told my father it was very moving. Oh, gosh.
11926	J.D.'s Thoughts	Wow.... The past and the present.
11927	J.D.'s Narration	Whenever I see two beautiful women that I've been intimate with talking to each other, I always have the same fantasy....
11928	Rerun	Come on, ladies! It's right hand, left hand, shoulder-pop, jump! Right hand, left hand, shoulder-pop, jump!
11929	J.D.	Mm!What are you two talking 'bout?
11930	Elliot	_Not_ the Rerun Dance.
11931	J.D.'s Thoughts	I tell her way too much.
11932	Jamie	You left some stuff in my apartment.
11933	J.D.	Oh, thanks!
11934	Jamie	See ya.
11935	J.D.	Mmm....
11936	Elliot	You wanna know why things with Jamie are so 'lamey'?
11937	J.D.	We're doing fine!
11938	Elliot	Oh, please! She's clearing you out of her apartment!
11939	J.D.	Wrong! She just came by because she knows today at work, I need my......squash goggles.
11940	Elliot	Mm.
11941	J.D.	I have to saw something later.
11942	Elliot	She's a drama queen, J.D.! When her husband was in a coma, it was all, like, taboo and exciting; but now that it's okay for the two of you to be together, the relationship's got no snap...it's got no crackle. J.D.... It's got no pop. I know! Because I'm a drama queen, too!
11943	J.D.	Well, Jamie is not like you, okay!?
11944	Elliot	No Pop!
11945	J.D.	Ditditditdit!
11946	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11947	Dr. Cox	Nine pounds in a _week_!? Let me ask you a quick question: are you trying to make my head explode? Because you have no idea just how frustrating it is working your _ass_ off trying to inflate a tiny little balloon inside someone's clogged artery. And all that a person has to do, really, is oh, I don't know go for a walk in the morning or choke down a fresh green salad. And you come back here looking like that!?! And I know, I know, here I'm supposed to be Dr. Give A Crap, but you wanna know the God's honest truth? And this is a fact you are what you eat, and you clearly went out and devoured a big fat guy, didn'cha!
11948	Lawyer	See, Dr. Cox, this is, uh, the sort of hostile behavior that can cause us legal difficulty.
11949	Dr. Cox	Ted! I just might rip that tie off your neck and jam it down your esophagus.
11950	Lawyer	I think you proved at Nurse Roberts' above-ground pool party that that doesn't solve anything.
11951	Dr. Kelso	Dammit, Perry! You can't just go around brow-beating nut-jobs and bullying fatties!
11952	Dr. Cox	Well, I'm not a resident, so I'm not going to your lame-ass doctor-patient seminar.... So, in essence, there, Big Bob, there's really nothing you can do to me at all, is there!Hello, class. My name is Dr. Perry Cox.... I'm going to be your teacher.No.No!NO!

11958	Turk	You can let your man fill a little bit of the hole that she left.

11966	Janitor	I wanted to see if you would whisper because I whispered.
11967	J.D.	I think I would.
11968	Janitor	Anyway, what's the deal? We're supposed to be shorts buddies today. You saw the schedule: Monday-Tuesday, shorts; Wednesday, we wash 'em; Thursday-Friday, shorts; weekend, optional I'll be wearing shorts.
11969	J.D.	Yeah, I know. I was gonna wear 'em, but you know someone went and stole them out of my locker!
11970	Janitor	What?
11971	J.D.	Yes!
11972	Janitor	Let me see!

11982	Jamie	You know what, I gotta get up kinda early, so maybe you should just crash at your place tonight.
11983	J.D.'s Thoughts	Look, she probably does have to get up early, so just be cool.
11984	J.D.	I'm so sorry! It was a total accident, I just...I just
11985	Jamie	Don't lie to me! I asked you to go, so you punched in my coffee table, didn't you.

11987	J.D.	Sometimes you make me so crazy!
11988	Jamie	Come here. I'll take care of you.

11996	Turk	She's not pregnant!Man, I was getting really psyched for this whole wedding, man the dancing, the band, you woulda hooked up with one of Carla's sisters!
11997	J.D.	Really? Which one?
11998	Turk	The drunkest one.
11999	J.D.	Nice!
12000	Turk	Plus, now there's no bachelor party; and you being the Best Man, I _know_ you woulda hooked it up!
12001	Rerun	All right, guys! Let's make it happen!
12002	Turk	Dude!
12003	J.D.	That woulda been awesome!
12004	Turk	I'm just having a hard time getting excited about all of this, you know what I mean?
12005	Chaplain	Well, you work here, so I guess we could do the whole ceremony for about forty bucks.
12006	Turk	Praise Jesus!
12007	J.D.'s Narration	As for my relationship, I was doing anything I could to keep the drama alive.
12008	J.D.	Look, Jamie and I are gonna be together, and I don't care what you think, Mom!

12017	J.D.	I don't know. How are you? Zinnnnng!
12018	Elliot	Why can't you just admit that I'm right?
12019	J.D.	Because you're not right!
12020	Elliot	NO POP! Heh!
12021	Jamie	What the hell was that all about?
12022	J.D.'s Thoughts	I wouldn't stoop this low for drama.
12023	J.D.	Well, we used to be a couple, and now that you're in the picture? Guess who wants me back!
12024	J.D.'s Thoughts	Fine, I'd stoop!
12025	Jamie	Oh, she better watch it!

12027	Nurse Roberts	Lester? Honey, I don't want you using the stove on your own.
12028	Man	Nurse, I asked for an extra pillow an hour ago!
12029	Nurse Roberts	I'm talking to my husband! So why don't you get your own damn pillow!?What?!
12030	Dr. Cox	And they stuck you in here for that?
12031	Nurse Roberts	I apologized to the old man! Anybody can have a bad day. Shoot.
12032	Dr. Cox	And what about you, there, Beavis?
12033	Todd	Oh, uhh....
12034	Patient	You know, Doctor, I'm getting a little tired of the sexual innuendo.
12035	Todd	In your end-o!
12036	Dr. Cox	That's great stuff. Ted, why don't you be a sport and...and get us started.
12037	Lawyer	Uh, people, we're here today....
12038	Dr. Cox	Snore! New idea: we're all gonna clam up for about an hour so I can get some shut-eye.Oh, and Nervous Guy
12039	Doug	Yes, Dr. Cox?
12040	Dr. Cox	if I were you, I'd go ahead and swallow that entire mouthful of baby carrots. Because, if I hear you make even one more damn crunch, I'm gonna use the remainder of the carrots in that bag to make you completely air-tight, son.
12041	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12042	Elliot	Hey, Jamie!
12043	Jamie	Hey, slut!
12044	J.D.	I can totally explain why Jamie said that. You know how Turk always says "hey, player" when he means "hey, buddy"?
12045	Elliot	Yeah...?
12046	J.D.	Well, Jamie's from Cincinnati, and in Cincinnati they say, "Hey, slut!"
12047	Elliot	Oh.... Neat!
12048	Carla	Turk? Are you sure you're happy we're doing this?
12049	Turk	Are you kidding me? This is my ideal wedding! It's cheap, there's no hassle, plus you said you'd call my mom and explain to her why she wasn't invited.
12050	Carla	No I didn't!What's in it for me?
12051	Turk	This!
12052	Carla	Oh, my God!
12053	Turk	Mm-hmm.
12054	Carla	Gimme the phone, I'll call her right now.You are such a momma's boy!
12055	Turk	Please! Dial mommy.
12056	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12057	Dr. Kelso	Dammit, Perry, you're there to teach! If I wanted somebody to lay around all day and do nothing, I would've wheeled in a corpse...or my housekeeper, Rosalba.
12058	Dr. Cox	Captain Clip-On? Did you go ahead and tattle on me?
12059	Lawyer	Oh, please, with the shocked look. Newsflash I'm sterile!I mean gutless! ...My guys swim in circles. I I think it's the bike-riding.
12060	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12061	Carla	Hey, Elliot.
12062	Elliot	Hey, slut!
12063	Carla	Excuse me?
12064	J.D.	Uh, Carla, could you give, uh, me and Elliot a second? I gotta talk to her privately.Thank you!Hey, uh, I just wanted to say, you were right about Jamie.
12065	Elliot	Uh-huh. And what does Jamie think you're doing over here?
12066	J.D.	Asking you not to show up at my apartment drunk, naked, and crying. You know what's weird? I really like this girl, but I'm not sure I can keep it going with all the drama.
12067	Elliot	I think you just have to gamble that once all the drama's gone, there's still gonna be something there. If not, it's her loss.
12068	J.D.	Yeah.
12069	Elliot	Still, if it helps:
12070	J.D.	Thanks.
12071	Elliot	Mm-hmm.
12072	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12073	Dr. Cox	Okay, here we go. When hospital employees fail to communicate properly with patients, there are both ethical and legal ramifications that can lead to financial hardships for the institution and personal grievances against its......doctors. Huh.
12074	Elliot	Dr. Cox! This is useless, I thought we were really going to learn something?
12075	Dr. Cox	Barbie, why did they toss you in here?
12076	Elliot	Oh, they didn't! I'm, uh...uh, I'm...auditing.
12077	Dr. Cox	Fine. Fine. Fine, fine, fine, fine. You wanna know the real skinny? If you want to be good doctors and nurses, you damn-sure better get ready to get in trouble a lot. Because patients are stupid, and they are really scared. And some of them need you to hold their hands, and you should. Others need you to kick their asses, and you absolutely should do that, too. But, it really all just comes down to whether or not you got the guts to say just exactly what you know in your heart of hearts you really should say.
12078	Dr. Kelso	Sooo, Ted! How is Professor Cox doing?
12079	Lawyer	Excellent, sir!
12080	Dr. Cox	Ha-haaa!
12081	Lawyer	And you know what else? I quit!
12082	Dr. Kelso	No, you don't.
12083	Lawyer	Well, I'm leaving early today!
12084	Dr. Kelso	No, you're coming back to my office and doing busy work!
12085	Lawyer	Fine. But I'm getting a soda first!
12086	Dr. Kelso	Whatever!

12088	Janitor	Doctor.
12089	J.D.	Janitor. What's that smell?
12090	Janitor	I don't know. Although, it smells a little bit like....The Truth!
12091	J.D.	Augh!
12092	Janitor	My poor wife _slaved_ over these!
12093	J.D.	She just cut off a pair of scrubs and hemmed the bottom. What's the big deal?
12094	Janitor	What's the big deal? Well, the Good Lord didn't bless my wife with all ten fingers. She's only got pointer...and...thumb-pinkie.
12095	J.D.	Look, I'm sorry, okay? For...so many things. But, I'm a doctor I can't really wear shorts to work.
12096	Janitor	Can't wear shorts to work?
12097	J.D.	Nope.
12098	Janitor	Can't wear shorts to _work_?
12099	J.D.	Not allowed!
12100	Jamie	Thanks. What's up with the man-____?
12101	J.D.	Oh, nothing. I'm just trying to mend some fences.
12102	Jamie	So, do you think Elliot's somewhere right now, crying her eyes out?
12103	J.D.	Oh, without a doubt.... But not about me. No, I...I kinda made all that stuff up. It just seems like you and I only really click when something crazy is going on.
12104	Jamie	Mm.
12105	J.D.	I dunno, I guess I realized I don't really want to be in a relationship like that.
12106	Jamie	Is that an ultimatum?
12107	J.D.	No, Jamie, no! It's not an ultimatum, it's just something to think about.Oh, shoot, I gotta go!
12108	Midget	You guys are having problems?
12109	Jamie	Yeah....
12110	J.D.	Hey! Sorry I'm late!
12111	Dr. Cox	Boy, I'll tell you what, it's just not a wedding without a Dallas Cowboy cheerleader, is it.
12112	Carla	Are you ready, Sweetie?
12113	Turk	Since the day I met you!
12114	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes it takes a priest to keep you from making a big mistake.
12115	Chaplain	Uh, Christopher, before we begin, remind me of the bride's name?
12116	Turk	Carla!
12117	Carla	I know it's silly and I know it's only for one day but ever since I was a little girl, all I wanted to do was have a big, beautiful wedding.
12118	Turk	Baby, you don't want to do this.
12119	Carla	What?
12120	Turk	Look, since your mother passed, you probably been feeling lonely, and like you don't have any family. But I'm your family now whether we do it like this, or we wait and do it like you've always wanted to. Don't you think?
12121	Dr. Cox	Holy cow, talk about your gigantic time-wasters.
12122	Nurse Roberts	Tell me about it.
12123	Elliot	Oh, come on lighten up, slut!
12124	Nurse Roberts	What, now?
12125	J.D.'s Narration	I think relationships can be defined by big moments that don't happen. ...Or by the little ones that do.
12126	Dr. Kelso's Office	Ted takes a moment alone in there to sit back in Dr. Kelso's chair, with his feet up on the desk, enjoying his Fresca.
12127	Lawyer	Ahhh. That's the stuff!
12128	J.D.'s Narration	But once you get past the drama, it's actually pretty simple.All we have to do is whatever it takes to make her happy.
12129	Bridal Boutique	Carla beams as she tries on her dream dress. Turk checks the tag.
12130	Turk	Four thousand six hundred and six Yeah! Yeah.... Yeah....
12131	Carla	Yeah!
12132	Turk	Yeah....

12134	Dr. Kelso	Nurse Espinosa, do you by any chance know what time your 9:30 shift starts?
12135	Carla	9:30?
12136	Dr. Kelso	See, that's what I would have said. But then I had Ted stand out in the parking lot and monitor your arrival times this week! Ted?
12137	Lawyer	9:34, 9:39, 9:41, 9:33, and 9:50.
12138	Carla	How is that law degree working out for you, Ted?
12139	Lawyer	I was going to be a senator.
12140	Dr. Kelso	I haven't perused the latest nursing contract, but I'm guessing it doesn't say "Show up when you damn well please!"
12141	Dr. Cox	Oh, hey, Bob, here's an idea: What say you stop showing up altogether? We'll just replace you with a giant time-clock. Oh, and if we ever get to missing you, we'll just have a tiny little Bob Kelso cuckoo bird pop out every couple of minutes and say "I've never satisfied a woman. I've never satisfied a woman. I've never satisfied a woman."
12142	Dr. Kelso	Come on, Ted!
12143	J.D.'s Narration	Even though Dr. Cox still didn't know he was the father of Jordan's baby, they were getting along better than ever.
12144	Jordan	Love you.
12145	Dr. Cox	I love you.
12146	J.D.'s Narration	As for us, it's the end of our second year, and somehow each day had begun to feel the same.You see, after a while, your residency boils down to just a few things...Paperwork...The three prescriptions every patient gets...
12147	Elliot	Give Miss Allan Acetaminophen for her headache, Restoril so she'll sleep, and Colace so she'll poop.
12148	J.D.'s Narration	Paperwork...Mind-numbing monotony...And, of course, paperwork.As for the patients...
12149	J.D.	Uh, look, Mr. Graff, because it's diabetes-related, the pain in your foot isn't responding to pain-killers. But, I'd like to try an anti-seizure medication before we even consider amputation.
12150	Mr. Graff	Oh, good. 'Cause I have an audition for "Stomp!" tomorrow. Look, just cut the damn thing off, will ya?
12151	J.D.'s Narration	I guess that's why I'm so psyched our college buddy, Spence, is coming to town.
12152	Spence	Jill Anderson.
12153	Turk	Yes.
12154	Spence	Yes.
12155	J.D.	No.
12156	Turk	Monica Meyer.
12157	Spence	Yeah.
12158	Turk	Yes.
12159	J.D.	You know, guys, I don't think it's really appropriate for us to be rehashing our college sexual conquests with Carla in the other room
12160	Turk	Leslie Stevens!
12161	J.D.	YES! On a pile of coats with hundreds of people around! What a whore!
12162	Carla	Who else! Who else did you bang??
12163	J.D.	Carla...college wasn't all sex and coats. Spence, here, got me through a lot of hard times.
12164	Spence	Why don't you just mousse the crap out of it straight up!
12165	J.D.	Yes!My life changed that day.
12166	Spence	Man, that was a long time ago! I mean, now you two are engaged, and I'm in town 'cause our frat brothers Shmitty and Dan are getting married....
12167	Carla	A double wedding?
12168	Spence	Mmm...
12169	J.D.	No.
12170	Turk	Mm-mm.
12171	Carla	Ohhhhhh.... Good for the boys!
12172	Spence	The point is, we've really grown up.
12173	Turk	Aw.
12174	J.D.	That's good good sauce.
12175	Spence	Check it out free pitcher.
12176	J.D.	What I've got you on is D5 half normal saline with 20 KCL at a hundred CCs an hour.
12177	Turk	This is the Cadillac of all hangover cures.
12178	Spence	It feels warm in my tummy!
12179	Dr. Cox	Good morning, angels. What'd you have, one too many daiquiris last night?
12180	J.D.	Spence, this is Dr. Cox and
12181	Jordan	Don't bother. Don't care.
12182	Spence	Oh, oh! Right, yeah! He's the scary man you told me about last night. Hey, congratulations!
12183	Dr. Cox	For what, jack-ass?
12184	Spence	You just had a baby!
12185	J.D.	No, no, no, _she_ just had a baby.
12186	Spence	Yeah, but you said it was his. ...And you said something else....
12187	Turk	That he didn't know it yet.
12188	Spence	That's exactly right!
12189	J.D.'s Thoughts	Holy crap! Run away! Run away! Run away! Run away! Run aw
12190	J.D.	Oook!
12191	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12192	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, he hasn't said a word in over ten minutes.... Eh, the hell with it. I'm going in.
12193	J.D.	Dr. Cox
12194	Dr. Cox	Newbie, if the next two words out of your mouth aren't "see ya", then the third word will be "Oh, my God, my crotch, you've punched me in the crotch."
12195	J.D.	See ya.
12196	Spence	How about that guy?
12197	J.D.	Yeah.
12198	Spence	That guy?
12199	J.D.	Yeah. You know what? Maybe it would just be easier if I told you whose butt I _haven't_ had my fingers in?
12200	Spence	Now that's one of the perks you never hear about. So, you guys pretty much landed your dream jobs, huh?
12201	J.D.'s Thoughts	Dream job....
12202	Turk	Hey, man? How am I supposed to finish this memo?
12203	J.D.	Mm-mm-mm.
12204	Spence	Do you at least have any interesting patients?
12205	Turk	Well, there's Mr. Weinberg, who has dementia but still enjoys his wronking.
12206	Spence	What's wronking?
12207	Old Man	WRONK!
12208	Spence	Interesting.
12209	Turk	Hey, Sweetness.
12210	J.D.	Wronk.
12211	Spence	Hey, so, uh, when do people get to yell, like, "stat!" and stuff?
12212	Carla	Kinda never. Bambi. Rounds!
12213	J.D.	Oh, dammit!
12214	Spence	RUN, JOHNNY! RUN!Just trying to add a little drama.
12215	Carla	I felt it!
12216	J.D.'s Thoughts	This is not a good day to be late.
12217	J.D.'s Narration	Every year at this time, Kelso picks a resident to ride mercilessly until they crumble. The key is to jump on any easy question and impress him early.
12218	Dr. Kelso	All right. Shall we get started?
12219	J.D.	Yes!
12220	Dr. Kelso	Excuse me?
12221	J.D.	"Should we get started?" Answer: yes.
12222	Dr. Kelso	Wow. Dr. Reid, do an ABG on bed four _without_ waking him.
12223	Elliot	Mm-hmm.
12224	Dr. Kelso	Dr., uh, uh...Young Asian Fellow, bed seven needs a central line.And Dr. Murphy and Dr. Eager Beaver, step forward.
12225	J.D.'s Thoughts	This is it. Last man standing.
12226	Dr. Kelso	What are the four differential diagnoses of the persistent ST elevation on any EKG? Dorian!
12227	J.D.	E-eschemia.
12228	Dr. Kelso	Murphy!
12229	Doug	Aneurysm.
12230	Dr. Kelso	Dorian!
12231	J.D.	Pericarditis.
12232	Dr. Kelso	Murphy!
12233	Doug	Pass!
12234	J.D.'s Thoughts	Aw, Doug.... At least you're going to a more chocolatey place.
12235	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Murphy....Dr. Reid! A moment please.
12236	Carla	No you didn't!
12237	Elliot	I did! And now every time I turn around, Dr. Kelso's riding me.
12238	Todd	I've got next! Wassaaaaap!No one? Self five! For the big dog.
12239	Carla	Look, Elliot, I've seen this before. Kelso starts to worry he's not scary anymore, so he picks somebody to be his bitch. Who he picks is totally random. You know, unless you...throw a needle in his face.
12240	Jordan	Okay, I didn't tell you that the kid was yours and you're upset I get it! But you seem to be making a really big deal out of this. Is there something else that's bothering you?
12241	Dr. Cox	It's mostly just the kid thing.
12242	Jordan	I told you, I didn't want you to feel pressured to be with me. I didn't want you to feel manipulated.
12243	Dr. Cox	Jordan, I am sooooosososososo sorry, but no matter what you say, you don't have a leg to stand on.
12244	Carla	Yeah, I don't know about that, Perry. Sounds to me like she's trying to protect your relationship.
12245	Elliot	Yeah, I mean, some people's mothers say the only way to get a guy to marry you is by using pregnancy as a trap.
12246	Dr. Cox	What!?
12247	Elliot	Uh, stupid mothers who got even meaner when they stopped drinking....

12251	J.D.	Uh, what?
12252	Janitor	I saw your paycheck, and I've been dying to tell you I make more than you do. Quite a bit more.
12253	J.D.	You couldn't have seen my paycheck.
12254	Janitor	Right. 'Cause there's no way I could access the personnel files. Just impossible!By the way, uh: 987-65-4320
12255	J.D.	That's my social security number!
12256	Janitor	No...that's your PIN number.
12257	J.D.	No, my PIN number is 3674.
12258	Janitor	Bingo!
12259	J.D.	Do you have any idea what it feels like to have a janitor make more money than you?
12260	Spence	Johnny.... Investment Banker. So, no.Why, Christopher?
12261	Turk	Hey, so I saved up, like, five hundred bucks? Where would you put that if you were me?
12262	Spence	I dunno, a wallet? A money-clip? Hey! You could get Shmitty and Dan a wedding gift. Dan wants a ferret.
12263	J.D.	Oh! Ferrets are nice!
12264	Turk	They're mean.
12265	Spence	Guys! Whatta you say we go do something special tonight, huh? My treat!
12266	J.D.	We gotta kinda lay low tonight, 'cause we're on back-up call.
12267	Turk	Back-up call.
12268	Spence	See, now, this is the proper way to lay low. I mean, honestly, does it get any better?
12269	Turk	No it does not!Why you keep looking at me like that?
12270	Spence	People!
12271	Lady	Ed! Did you turn on the jets in the hot tub?
12272	Ed	No!

12276	Lawyer	I don't know, sir. Yes, no...I'm barely here.
12277	Elliot	I know what you're doing, sir the whole "keep us scared" thing. Grrrrrr! Heh! I am okay with it.
12278	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Reid, even if you hadn't just missed blinding me earlier, I still would've picked you to crap on. See, you're easily startled, you're constantly overwhelmed, and while you work as hard as anyone here, you're still struggling to break into the middle of the pack! I chose you because I am hoping that you will ask yourself _really_ ask yourself if there isn't some other profession you might be better suited for. In the meantime, be a doll a re-suture that wound.

12283	Dr. Cox	You're making jokes?
12284	Jordan	I just want this to be okay.
12285	Dr. Cox	Jordan, don't get me wrong, I wanna be the with kid I'm...I'm damn sure gonna be with the kid but as far as you and I go...I just don't see us working out.

12287	Spence	Nothing like drinking cold beers in a jacuzzi, am I right, Ed?
12288	Ed	Hell, some days I just sit out here for hours on end, downing cold one after cold one.
12289	J.D.	What do you do when you have to pee?
12290	Ed	So you boys are doctors, huh?
12291	Turk	Okay, yeah whoa, Frannie! That was my ass!
12292	Spence	You guys have to go to work?
12293	J.D.	Nah, it's just a stupid intern.
12294	Turk	Besides, the only way we'd have to go in is if there was some kind of catastrophe.
12295	Newscaster	In breaking news, there's been a multiple-car pile-up on the throughway.
12296	J.D.	Plus, the two guys who are on call would have to be, like, simultaneously incapacitated.
12297	Newscaster	Twelve vehicles were involved in the accident. Eyewitness reports...
12298	Doug	This is my chance to shine!
12299	Todd	Wassup, chica!Ohh, ohhh! God!
12300	J.D.'s Narration	Part of being a doctor is learning to deal with the unexpected. Whether it's someone who won't take "no" for an answer...
12301	Hospital Hall	Jordan follows Dr. Cox through.
12302	Jordan	Yeah, I've decided not to accept the whole being dumped thing. I'm just gonna hang around until you forgive me.

12304	I.C.U.	Elliot stands frozen by Dr. Kelso's words.
12305	Old man	WRONK!
12306	Ted	Gaaagh!
12307	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, sometimes it's just having to work in wet grundies.
12308	Dr. Cox	Hey, Betty. Hey, Wilma. Oh, what the hell, you're only forty minutes late. Do I...do I smell beer?
12309	J.D.	Uh, we...we, uh, we had a few.
12310	Dr. Cox	Newsflash: you can't drink and then come to work you're not airline pilots!
12311	J.D.	Look, Dr. Cox....
12312	Dr. Cox	No, you look! If someone had asked me just this morning, Is there any way that I could have less respect for you two geniuses? I would have said, "No! No, that's not possible!" But, lo and behold, you went and pulled it off. Congratulations. The only problem is I'm I'm fresh out of blue ribbons, so instead, you're gonna have to settle for a lifetime supply of my foot up your ass! Now go home. You're not fit to work tonight.
12313	Jordan	Great speech.You guys are in trouble!...Wait up! I got my heels on!
12314	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12315	J.D.'s Narration	After what happened, I was in no mood to be messed with.
12316	Janitor	Hey, Foodstamps!Little anonymous donation from a guy who makes a little more scratch than you.
12317	J.D.	You know what? At least what I do matters! Okay? You're cleaning the same spot you were this morning, and the smart money says you'll be cleaning it again tomorrow. So why don't I just come by then, and you can tell me how what you do day after day makes even the slightest bit of difference in this world.
12318	Janitor	Too mean!
12319	J.D.'s Narration	I don't care if I hurt his feelings, 'cause I got absolutely crushed tonight. Luckily, Turk and I both knew who was responsible for all this.
12320	Spence	Crockett. Tubbs.

12322	Jordan	When do we eat?
12323	Dr. Cox	Look, Jordan, could you just give me ten seconds to myself here?
12324	Jordan	Mmmm, no.
12325	Dr. Cox	You know, you are being very immature! And, oh, my God! Is that guy on fire!?
12326	Elliot	Dr. Cox! I'm so glad you're here!
12327	Dr. Cox	Oh, from one hell to another.
12328	Elliot	Oh. Dr. Kelso's been torturing me lately, and I really thought that I could handle it. I mean, after all, I've come a long way...you know. For instance, I used to be afraid of you, and now I can talk to you about anything like how your hair has been looking particularly springy lately. And not like the season, but more like the inside of a mattress. You know what I mean?
12329	Dr. Cox	I don't have any clue what you mean!
12330	Elliot	Dr. Kelso's starting to get to me, and I don't think I can take it anymore.
12331	Dr. Cox	Sorry, kid, but I'm kinda dealing with my own stuff right now.
12332	Elliot	Thanks a lot. Really.
12333	Jordan	Howdy, Mop-top!
12334	Dr. Cox	Oh, God!
12335	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12336	Turk	Man, why'd you even show up this weekend?
12337	Spence	What are you talking about? I'm the one who introduced Shmitty and Dan! ...Okay.... I didn't really introduce them, but I'm the one who accidentally saw them under the foosball table. Aw, Shmitty....
12338	J.D.	Typical Spence. You just blow into town and get us in a bunch of trouble.
12339	Spence	What, I _made_ you guys go out tonight? Hey, I have a venture capital presentation Thursday. Ask me if I want to go out drinking Wednesday night.
12340	J.D. and Turk	You wanna go
12341	Spence	Sorry, sorry, I can't. I have a presentation. You see, the truth is you guys have been complaining about work since the second I got here, just dying for an excuse to blow it off. So maybe you should stop being all mad at me when really you're just pissed 'cause you hate your jobs.
12342	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12343	Elliot	Every time I turn around, Kelso's there! Ted, he's trying to break my spirit! I mean, do you have any idea what that feels like?Oh, I'm sorry 'course you do.
12344	Lawyer	Dr. Reid, I'm afraid that nothing you've described constitutes harassment.
12345	Dr. Kelso	Swing and a miss, eh, Dr. Reid! Well, the next time you decide to make a stink over nothing, maybe you should see a lawyer who didn't need five tries to pass the bar exam!
12346	Lawyer	I have stress-induced dyslexia, and you know that, Dr...Oslek.
12347	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12348	Dr. Cox	Why are you doing this?
12349	Jordan	I'll tell you why I'm doing this, Perry. Because we've been dancing the same annoying dance for years now! One of us gets angry and walks away, and the other person's too stubborn to go after them. Before you know it, you're sleeping with some toothpick-size pharmaceutical rep, and I'm trying to convince my mom that the thing in my suitcase is a giant electric melon-baller! Well guess what? Things are different now we have a kid together. I'm not going home until you promise that you're coming home with me.
12350	Dr. Cox	You go home. I'll meet you there later.
12351	Jordan	Bring dinner.You're a father, can you believe it?
12352	Dr. Cox	No.
12353	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12354	J.D.'s Narration	I didn't get a lot of sleep thinking about what Spence had said.
12355	J.D.	Look, I'm sorry I was such a jerk yesterday, okay? I mean, come on, look at this floor! You could practically eat off of it!
12356	Janitor	Would you?
12357	J.D.	Would I what?
12358	Janitor	Would you eat off the floor?
12359	J.D.'s Narration	As I bent down to eat that peppered floor turkey, unaware that the cleanser the Janitor uses is an extremely potent diuretic, I realized something.
12360	J.D.	Aaaaah.
12361	J.D.'s Narration	...The reason we're doctors is because we have an innate desire to help people.
12362	Janitor	That was disgusting.
12363	J.D.'s Narration	And you have to have that desire, because at the end of your second year it's impossible to see the light at the end of the tunnel.So it becomes about perseverance......and fortitude......and sacrifice.
12364	Hospital Entrance	J.D. and Turk are seeing Spence off.
12365	Spence	Well, I'm sorry you guys can't make the wedding.
12366	J.D.	Yeah, well, give the guys a big kiss for us.
12367	Turk	Don't forget to tell 'em that the ferret only eats fresh vegetables.
12368	Spence	I'm gonna miss you guys.... I'll see you later.
12369	J.D.	Later.
12370	Turk	Later, dude.
12371	J.D.'s Narration	Really, all you can hope for is just an occasional thank-you.
12372	J.D.	I'm so glad the medication worked on your foot.
12373	Mr. Graff	So I'm supposed to be happy because someone finally did something right?
12374	J.D.'s Thoughts	You're welcome.
12375	Dr. Cox	Nice call on the anti-seizure medication, there, Newbie. You know I'm actually starting to think you may not be the worst resident that ever lived.
12376	J.D.	Ohhh! How cool was that!
12377	Mr. Graff	Shut up.
12378	J.D.	You shut up. You're an angry man!I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the whole "it's your baby" thing.We'll probably talk about that later.
12379	Dr. Cox	You know I'm I wasn't even mad at Jordan.
12380	J.D.	No?
12381	Dr. Cox	No, I was scared. In fact, I was freaking out all day, because I'm quite confident that I'm gonna be an absolutely horrible father.
12382	J.D.	You? Come on! You're gonna be a very scary fath I mean a great...you're gonna be a great father. Like last night, when you totally kicked our asses 'cause we deserved it? And do you remember that time you told me I wasn't the worst resident that ever lived?
12383	Dr. Cox	You mean like eight seconds ago?
12384	J.D.	You have no idea how much that meant to me.
12385	Dr. Cox	I said I _think_ you may not be the worst resident ever, but I can't be sure of stuff like that. Come on, I haven't done the appropriate leg work!
12386	J.D.	But, Dr. Cox, you're always there when we need you! I think you have this fathering thing down!
12387	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12388	Dr. Kelso	Why am I not leaving, Dr. Reid? Because I don't want to miss you breaking down and weeping in front of everyone! Oh, here it comes! Great big tears! Great big crocodile tears!
12389	J.D.	See, if she was your daughter, you'd totally know how to handle it.
12390	Dr. Cox	My God, you're right.You're doing fine, there, Barbie.
12391	Elliot	Thank you?
12392	Dr. Cox	Everybody have a good one! I'm going home to see my son.Whoa, excuse me, there, Bobbo.
12393	Nurse Roberts	Girl! He hit him right in the nose! Uh-huh! Yeah!
12394	J.D.'s Thoughts	That may come up tomorrow....
12395	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12396	J.D.'s Narration	Before I go into that building and start my day, I always like to take a quiet moment to prepare myself.
12397	J.D.	Bump-ba-bump-ba-bump, ba-bump, bump; bump, bump, bump. "Well I guess it would be nice / if I could touch your body" not you, sir "I know not everybody / has got a body like you / Owwwwwwwww / But I...."
12398	Turk	Dude, what's the rule about white boys dancing in public?
12399	J.D.	Not allowed unless you're gay.
12400	J.D. & Turk	Morning, Steven.
12401	J.D.	Fine. Then I'll just put on something that rocks!
12402	J.D.'s Narration	As a third-year resident, you know everyone so well you can practically speak for them. For instance....
12403	J.D.'s Thoughts	Remember: No more dancing.Pow!Good morning, Bambi. Sign this, please?Who you eyeballing, tough guy?
12404	J.D.'s Narration	And of course....
12405	J.D.'s Thoughts	Well, Zsa Zsa. Now you've put me in quite the pickle. You see, with those earphones on, you can't hear me; but! the odds are highly against you cracking open that yapper and annoying me today. So, what to do? What to do? What to do? Ahh, hell
12406	Dr. Cox	Stop addressing me as "Dr. Cox" in front of your patients. When they find out my actual name, they tend to page me with questions when they realize just exactly how inept you really are. Oh, and as an added safety measure, from now on, I'll only be responding to "Doc," "Doctor," "Ceasar," or "The Big Cheese;" and noooo, I'm _not_ joking. Not _now_ not ever.
12407	J.D.'s Narration	See, things never really change around here....Surgical and Medical still play each other in basketball.
12408	Surgeon	I'm gonna toast you so bad, your momma ain't even gonna recognize you!
12409	J.D.	Yeah? Well I heard that your sister started drinking again!
12410	J.D.'s Narration	I'm still not great at smack-talk.
12411	J.D.	So, it's not supposed to be true?
12412	Turk	No. Ohhh, let it pour, big guy.
12413	J.D.'s Narration	And Elliot was still searching for something to turn things around for her.
12414	Elliot	Oh, my God! Isn't she beautiful! I mean, this car has totally maxed out my credit, but my self-esteem's been so low lately that I think it's worth it. Don't you?
12415	Delivery Guy	I just deliver the cars. She's all yours.
12416	Elliot	Frick!
12417	J.D.'s Narration	But really, the only difference is that by the third year, nothing catches you by surprise.
12418	Carla	Mrs. Farr is still having acute abdominal pain.
12419	Mrs. Farr	So, what's wrong with me, doctor?
12420	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, good Lord, I have no idea. Okay, don't panic, just do what all doctors do in this situation and fake a page.
12421	J.D.	Uh-oh. Got a Code 3 down the hall.
12422	Mrs. Farr	What's that?
12423	J.D.	Uhhh, Code 3? Not as bad as a Code 4, but a hell of a lot worse than a Code 2.
12424	Carla	_That's_ a Code 2.
12425	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12426	J.D.	Ahh, I cannot figure out what's wrong with Mrs. Farr. I gotta go ask Cox.
12427	Turk	Why won't you ask me?
12428	J.D.	You're a surgeon you just cut people up, you don't actually know anything.
12429	Turk	Oh, yeah.
12430	J.D.	Dr. Cox! Dr. Cox.Big Cheese.
12431	Dr. Cox	Yes?
12432	J.D.'s Narration	If you're wondering why Dr. Kelso's nose is squeaking......about a week ago, he was torturing Elliot......and Dr. Cox, well....Needless to say, there were consequences.
12433	Dr. Kelso	Perry, great news: I managed to swing it so that you get to go over to the state pen. today and do the annual inmates' physicals!
12434	Dr. Cox	Well, hell's bells, Bobbo, if you want to fire me, just do it!
12435	Dr. Kelso	I would, but even though this room was quite crowded when you sucker-punched me, apparently nobody saw it happen.
12436	Lawyer	Uh, so what happened, sir?
12437	J.D.	So, Dr. Cox, can you, uh, look at her chart?
12438	Dr. Cox	Newbie, did you not see what just happened? Kelso is so far up my ass that I can taste Brylcreem in the back of my throat. And you, you're...you're third-year now. Wake up, this whole Dr. Cox Riding in to The Rescue part of the show is _over_.Oh, you're on your own.
12439	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12440	J.D.'s Narration	Elliot's unlucky streak continued with the head of the radiology department.
12441	Elliot	Dr. Moyer. Uh, you told me my patient had colitis, and it turns out it was just traveler's diarrhea?
12442	Dr. Moyer	So? Sounds like good news.
12443	Elliot	Yeah.... He took it as bad news, maybe 'cause of the unnecessary colonoscope I shoved three feet up his pooper?
12444	Dr. Moyer	What do you want me to do?
12445	Elliot	Uh, apologize to my patient and tell him it was your mistake, no big deal?
12446	Dr. Moyer	Think I'm gonna pass on that one. See, I got you pegged as one of those spineless types that's not gonna cause me any trouble no matter what I do. So, thanks for stopping by, and don't forget your car door.
12447	Elliot	I just didn't want it to get stolen, okay?
12448	Dr. Moyer	That was me not caring.
12449	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12450	Janitor	What?

12453	Lawyer	So, you're engaged to that surgeon guy?
12454	Carla	Mm-hmm.
12455	Lawyer	Is it serious?
12456	Carla	No, Ted. We swing.
12457	Janitor	Squeaky's a-comin'!
12458	Dr. Cox	Oh, hey, Bob-cat! Listen, I was hoping that maybe you could get someone to cover for me out at the prison tonight. I know that the very idea of you doing a favor for me makes those ass cheeks clench up so tight that you could shove a lump of coal up there and probably crap out a diamond! Right?Ohh.... Come on, Bob, I can't even remember the last time I saw my son, and you you you're a father, for God's sake; you understand, don't you?
12459	Dr. Kelso	My son was recently kicked out of his Hari Krishna sect for being too much of a hippie, and is currently residing in the Portland subway system. The point, Perry, is that the only thing I care less about than my son...is your son. Have fun at the Big House.

12461	Carla	Hey. You guys know that unbelievably handsome new anesthesiologist?
12462	J.D.	Yes.
12463	Turk	No.
12464	J.D.	No.
12465	Carla	Well, he didn't know I was engaged, so he asked me out to a movie tonight.
12466	Turk	Well, if he's paying, give a brother some Snow Caps!
12467	Carla	Turk, why don't you ever get jealous?
12468	Turk	Woman, look at me! How can someone with all of this here be jealous of any of that out there!
12469	Elliot	You know what I realized when I was dragging my car door around? I cannot remember the last good thing that happened to me at this place. I mean, what is it about me that makes everybody walk all over me?
12470	Carla	No self-confidence.
12471	Turk	You could be a baby sometimes.
12472	J.D.	Your voice gets really high when you're upset.
12473	Elliot	Rhetorical question, okay?
12474	Carla	Peach Fizzle-Vizzle?
12475	J.D.	I'll have a Razz-ma-Tazz?
12476	Turk	Orange Goo Goo.
12477	Elliot	Got it.
12478	J.D.	Mrs. Farr. You know what? The only way I'm gonna figure out what's wrong with this woman is start running tests for everything.
12479	Carla	Good luck, Bambi. Look at the time.
12480	J.D.'s Narration	In a hospital, you can never try to get anything done Friday after 5 P.M. Because anyone who can actually help you is out of here like a gunshot.
12481	J.D.	Hello? Anyone?Have a good weekend, Steven.

12483	Elliot	Sean?

12485	Elliot	You look great! Except, the buzz-cut has kind of tapped into this recurring dream I have where my dad makes me marry this army colonel named Johnny Case who, as it turns out, already has a wife in the Philippines. Anyways, she and I become friends, but then she smothers him with her thighs and then frames me for it.
12486	Sean	Well, yeah, I'm I'm doing about the same, too.I thought you hated this place 'cause of that time you you got sick here?
12487	Elliot	You remember that?
12488	Sean	Y-you got sick on my face....
12489	Elliot	Oh, no, that wasn't the smoothies you just said you thought you were falling in love with me, and sometimes when I get really uncomfortable I hurl.
12490	Sean	I know, I get I get a little, uh...gassy.
12491	Elliot	Look, Sean, this is gonna sound weird, but this is fate! I mean, things have just been so bleak for me lately, and I've been waiting for something someone to come along, you know? And...here you are. The one that got away! That means something, right?
12492	Sean	Yeah, I think it, uh....
12493	Girl	Hello!
12494	Sean	Hey. Hi. Oh!No, no, no, no! It's okay. It's ok it's....
12495	Girl	That girl is extra-strength crazy.

12502	J.D.	No, the cook died.
12503	J.D.'s Thoughts	What the hell am I gonna do?
12504	Turk	Hey.She wanted to come back and help. And I wasn't gonna let my baby be here all alone with all sorts of guys eyeballing her privates and whatnot.
12505	Carla	If you can't muster up some sincere jealousy, don't even bother.
12506	Elliot	I got everyone's smoothies. They were out of Orange Goo Goo.
12507	Carla	How can we help, Bambi?
12508	J.D.	Okay, if we're ever gonna figure out what's wrong with that lady, we need to get a whole bunch of tests done.
12509	J.D.'s Narration	There's nothing wrong with needing your friends to take care of someone.... It's better than missing out on your family because you're stuck making new friends....
12510	Dr. Cox	That's, uh, that's my son.
12511	Prisoner	He's adorable. Can I keep it?
12512	Dr. Cox	No, no you you certainly may not!Bad man.
12513	J.D.'s Narration	Still, even that's not the worst....
12514	J.D.	'Kay, I'll get the x-ray, you two go work on the echo-cardiogram, and then all three of us will meet back here and deal with the abdominal CAT-scan, okay?
12515	Carla	Got'cha.
12516	Turk	Mm-hmm.
12517	Elliot	Well, what can I do?
12518	J.D.	We got it, Elliot.

12523	Nurse Roberts	You'll be okay, Marshmallow.
12524	Elliot	Laverne, do you call me "Marshmallow" because I'm soft and easily flattened?
12525	Nurse Roberts	Well, yeah.... But, if it makes you feel any better, it's also because you're _very_ white.

12541	Turk	Okay! Oh-ho-ho! You're telling me this guy in here got tasty treats?
12542	Carla	Turk! I worked here eight years before you showed up I had sexual needs.
12543	Turk	Okay, first of all, that's disgusting.
12544	Carla	Are you jealous?
12545	Turk	Nahhh....
12546	Carla	Ahhh, so you don't mind if I go in there alone.
12547	Turk	Thank you.AGH!
12548	Carla	So, Mitchell, I guess I was just hoping that you would help us out with this patient, Mrs. Farr.

12559	Jordan	I may have painted his toenails for funsies.
12560	J.D.	Dr. Cox, I managed to get some tests done on Mrs. Farr....
12561	Dr. Cox	Look, Gwyneth, you're old enough now to hear this from me: Every time I go out of my way to help you children, I get nothing but trouble. Now this is the first five-minute window I've had in the last week to be with my son. And I'm just not gonna have you pirouetting around in here while my heart is breaking inside.

12569	Janitor	I'm just gonna replace these, uh, urinal cakes , and then, uh, I'll go.
12570	Elliot	Why can't I just grow up? Why can't I be stronger?
12571	Janitor	No.... I'm a winner. But, I will tell you something that my grandmother told me when I was a kid; even though at the time I thought she was my mother. She said, "Time spent wishing is time wasted." Now, she died shortly after that, and my sister who actually _was_ my mother she never got over it. Neither did my brother-dad. But the point is this: If you want to be different, then be different!
12572	Elliot	Thank you.
12573	J.D.	Well, we're all under one roof here, we gotta watch out for each other, right? Come on!
12574	Elliot	'Kay.
12575	Janitor	There he is.
12576	J.D.	Whoooa! Agh!
12577	Janitor	Watch out.
12578	J.D.'s Thoughts	Ow.
12579	J.D.'s Narration	Unfortunately, that's when we ran into a brick wall.
12580	Dr. Moyer	I'm head of the radiology department. You call me in from home to do an abdominal CAT-scan that could wait until Monday morning? Well, guess what? It's not happening.
12581	J.D.	Look, Dr. Moyer
12582	Dr. Moyer	THESE ARE MY MACHINES!
12583	Carla	Sir
12584	Dr. Moyer	MY MACHINES!
12585	Turk	Whose machines?
12586	Dr. Moyer	MY MACHINES!
12587	J.D.	How is that helpful?
12588	Dr. Moyer	THEY'RE MINE! MINE! MY MACHINES! MY MACHINES! MY MACHINES!! MY MACHINES!!!

12590	Dr. Kelso	Oh, so you're going to sock me again. Good God, Perry, at a certain point you're just beating up an old man.
12591	Dr. Cox	Relax. I'm just fixing your nose.
12592	Dr. Kelso	Mmgh!
12593	Dr. Cox	Now, I'm real sorry I cold-cocked you, there, Bob I shouldn't have done that. Even if it did actually feel so damn good I changed my pants afterwards.But, still, I'm starting to think it would be smart if you and I were to bury the hatchet. What do you say, there, Bob?Come, on, handsome!
12594	Dr. Kelso	Listen up, ace: You will always be a royal pain in my ass, and I will always be waiting for the day when I get to jam that knife into your side once and for all; and you know it as well as I do!Much better, thanks!
12595	Dr. Cox	You're welcome.
12596	Dr. Kelso	People don't change, Perry.
12597	Elliot's Thoughts	So you're just gonna roll over and give up like you always do? Or are you finally gonna get mad and do something about it?
12598	Dr. Moyer	MINE! MINE! MINE! MINE! MINE!!!
12599	Elliot	Dr. Moyer, you're gonna give Mrs. Farr the abdominal CAT-scan, and I'll tell you why: You remember that colon patient of mine that you screwed up on? Well I'm gonna tell him exactly whose fault that was, and then I'm gonna spend every waking second helping him figure out how to physically and financially bitch-slap you, even if the end result is that we both get our asses fired. Your move, chuckles.
12600	Dr. Moyer	Bring her down.
12601	Carla	Elliot!
12602	Turk	Hell, zhyeah!
12603	J.D.	Wow.
12604	J.D.'s Thoughts	It feels good to work as a team and gather all the pieces of the puzzle together so we can finally look Mrs. Farr in the face and tell her...we still don't know what the hell she has.
12605	J.D.	Dammit, why can't we figure out what's wrong with this lady?
12606	Dr. Cox	All right, you guys. What do you know so far?
12607	Carla	The echo ruled out an aortic dissection.
12608	Turk	The abdominal CT would have shown if it was biliary disease.
12609	Dr. Cox	Think. What's her background?
12610	Elliot	Persian Sephardic Jew.
12611	Dr. Cox	Aw, come on, you guys, gimme a break you know this.
12612	J.D.	Familial Mediterranean fever.
12613	Dr. Cox	Atta boy.
12614	J.D.'s Narration	I'm actually grateful most things don't change.
12615	Dr. Kelso	Hello, slackers!
12616	Lawyer	My paddle's stuck in me!
12617	J.D.'s Narration	Not only is the status quo good for work, it's also somewhat comforting.
12618	Dr. Cox	Now, I would've never figured it out unless you guys had done the leg work. You four deserve all the credit, really.Mrs. Farr, Dr. Cox has saved the day! Don't ya just love it? Come here!
12619	J.D.'s Narration	And if something does change, more often than not it just reminds you of feelings you've had all along.
12620	J.D.	You look beautiful.
12621	J.D.'s Narration	Like I said, once you hit the third year, there aren't a lot of surprises.
12622	Sean	Hey, Elliot.
12623	Elliot	Hey! What are you doing here?
12624	J.D.'s Thoughts	Damn.
12625	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12626	J.D.'s Narration	Hospitals are filled with people who just came off 18-hour shifts. So when a patient dies, it's not uncommon to take them to the morgue yourself, then grab a little shut-eye in their bed.Unfortunately, sometimes you're beaten to the punch.
12627	J.D.	I'm up!You can hardly notice it. It's actually kinda pretty!
12628	Nurse Roberts	Jack-ass.
12629	Turk	Look who's here.
12630	J.D.'s Narration	I'm never happy when a guy comes back into Elliot's life. But at least with Sean...it's entertaining.
12631	Elliot	Thanks for the latte. I should have warned you that the reason I love that place is that they're known for making the hottest coffee in town.
12632	Sean	Yeah, well, no sthweat. You know, lessthon learned.
12633	Carla	Is it me, or do those two seem less awkward around each other?
12634	Sean	Sthee ya, Elliot.
12635	Elliot	See ya!
12636	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12637	Carla	Okay, I have some news! We picked a date for the wedding.Tell 'em Turk.April 24th!
12638	Elliot	No, way! Mine is April 25th! 2006! Oh, the place I love in Connecticut books up early so what the hell, took a shot.
12639	J.D.	One, two, three...
12640	Elliot	Oh, so you've never dreamt about your wedding day.
12641	Priest	Do you, John Dorian, take Marcia Brady to be your wife?
12642	Maureen McCormick	My name is Maureen McCormick.
12643	J.D.	Marcia, please!No, I have not!
12644	Carla	Bambi, not everyone loves Journey as much as you.
12645	J.D.	I don't _love_ Journey.
12646	Turk	"She's just a small town girl..."
12647	J.D.	"...Livin' in a lonely world! She took a midnight train goin' aaaanywheeeere!" Fine, I love 'em. If you wanna book the band, they're called The Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin's and they rock! Book 'em now, thank me later.
12648	J.D.'s Narration	After that, the day got worse.
12649	Elliot	Thanks for giving me a ride down here to see Sean.
12650	Carla	I've never been to Sea World. What exactly does Sean do here, anyway?
12651	J.D.	Probably cleans up the seal poop!
12652	Elliot	There he is!
12653	J.D.	Lame!
12654	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12655	Carla	Who left this urine here?
12656	Dr. Cox	Someone's got a secret admirer!
12657	Carla	Dr. Kelso? Someone left this urine specimen sitting around. What's interesting is that the name tag's been ripped right off.
12658	Dr. Kelso	Sweetheart, I think you're confusing interesting with boring.
12659	J.D.	I can't believe you and Carla set a date.
12660	Turk	Yep, it's happening.
12661	Dr. Cox	Wedding talk! Ohh, how lovely!
12662	J.D.	Anyway, about this whole setting the date thing: I mean, I'm really psyched for you guys, it's just gonna be harder and harder for us to hang out, you know? I mean, you're gonna be married, man! You're gonna have, like, a house! You know? You're gonna be spending your weekends chasing around little Arturo and Rosaria!
12663	Turk	You mean Tamika and Fuquan?
12664	J.D.	You should...talk to Carla....
12665	Turk	Sounds like you're asking me out on a man-date.
12666	J.D.	Turk, why are you so afraid of loving me?
12667	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12668	Sean	Up!
12669	Elliot	Whoa! Do you actually talk to each other?
12670	Sean	Elliot, come on, he's just a dolphin.Because, Bruce, then she would think I was crazy, that's why!
12671	Elliot	You know, I am so glad that we're dating again.
12672	Sean	Elliot, we're not dating.
12673	Elliot	Why don't you want to be dating?
12674	Sean	Th well all right.... Here.... Man! Why is everything so much easier with dolphins?
12675	Elliot	Because you're not trying to date a dolphin.
12676	Sean	No. No. Well, not after that big talk they gave us. Elliot, last time we were together, I thought everything was going great, and then out of nowhere you dumped me for your job. I gotta be honest with you, I've never been so crushed in my entire life.
12677	Elliot	Really?
12678	Sean	Well, do you think that, uhh...you think the new Elliot, uh, would like to go to dinner tonight?
12679	Elliot	I don't know.... She's very busy....
12680	Sean	Mm-hmmm.
12681	Elliot	Oh!
12682	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12683	Carla	Well, I'm telling you, Laverne, by this afternoon we're gonna find out whose urine this is.
12684	Nurse Roberts	I got a better idea: Why don't _you_ do that. I'm gonna run across the street and get my tooth fixed so I can stop looking like Larry Holmes.
12685	Dr. Cox	Carla, you're forcing me to say something that I prayed I'd never have to say again to another woman: Please, please, please, put down the cup of urine.
12686	Cashier	6.50, please.
12687	Carla	6.50? For an egg-salad sandwich?
12688	Cashier	4.50 for the egg-salad, 2 bucks for the apple juice that you put in a urine container.
12689	Carla	Who would do that?!
12690	Todd	Just the burger for me.
12691	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12692	J.D.	Mr. Quinn, before I examine your clavicle, let me ask you something: Do you think it's out of line for me to want to take my best friend here to dinner?
12693	Mr. Quinn	Well, I, uhh....
12694	J.D.	I mean, this is like the end of an era! Okay? We've always been known as Turk-&-J.D. Like, when we were in college, people'd be like, "When are Turk-&-J.D. getting here?" Right? And then in med school, everyone was like, "When _are_ Turk-&-J.D. getting here?"
12695	Turk	We didn't have a car.
12696	J.D.	The point is, we were together so much, this one Indian girl only slept with him 'cause she thought his last name was "Anjadi".
12697	Turk	It was a very good day for me!
12698	J.D.	See! This is the kind of stuff I'm gonna miss! The...the reminiscing...the way your breath always smelled of curry....
12699	Turk	All right, fine, it's a man-date. Now, you and I, we're still on for surgery tomorrow, right?
12700	Mr. Quinn	Right. Listen, when you slice me up, make sure you don't mess up my tatt. my fiancé, Tracy, would kill me.
12701	J.D.	I had a tattoo once.
12702	Turk	Dude, you got your face painted at the hospital picnic.
12703	J.D.	I was a cougar! Arrgh-arrgh-aaarrgh! See ya later.
12704	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12705	Elliot	Dr. Cox, does this shade of red make me look like a clown?
12706	Dr. Cox	No, Barbie, no. It makes you look like a prostitute who caters exclusively _to_ clowns.
12707	Elliot	Oh, I'm sorry, that was my mistake. I keep forgetting that you're a horrible, horrible person.
12708	Dr. Cox	Oooh, backbone, Barbie.Heeee-xcuse me! You wouldn't happen to be signing out Mr. Hudson to the on-call resident, would you?
12709	Elliot	Eee-yeah, why?
12710	Dr. Cox	He's your patient, he needs a lumbar puncture, and you can't necessarily count on the on-call resident to do that, now, can you?
12711	Elliot	It's just that, Dr. Cox, I've got a date with this guy named Sean
12712	Dr. Cox	Would you do me a personal favor and excuse me just for one moment?
12713	Elliot	Yeah?Dr. Cox, I cannot miss this dinner!
12714	Dr. Cox	Oh! Barbie, I I actually see your point. You should, in fact, go on your little date, because I have some busy work that's gonna take me over into the vicinity of Mr. Hudson's room, so I'll just pop my head in there and tell him that he's going to die. But, if you have a moment between dinner and giving it away for free, if you could pick up the phone and call Mr. Hudson's wife and kids and tell them about, you know, the dying...?Oh, I know, sugar. This would be just the most terrific place to work on the planet if it weren't for all these sick people. Wouldn't it.
12715	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12716	Carla	I'm sorry! I just thought that, as a urine lab technician, you'd be at least half as interested in urine as I am!
12717	Janitor	Hey, you know, I uh, it's not any of my business, but I think I know whose wizz that is.
12718	Carla	I love you!Okay, go.
12719	Janitor	Uh, his name is Mr. Freely.
12720	Carla	First name?
12721	J.D.	I.P.
12722	Carla	"I.P. Freely"?
12723	Janitor	Funny in third grade, funny now.
12724	Carla	Listen, Stretch, if you know who this belongs to, I'd 'fess up right now. Otherwise, I'm gonna grab you by the back of that two-dollar haircut and force-feed you the sample so _you_ can carry it around all day. That way, if I ever want it back, all I have to do is point you at a beaker and squeeze really hard! Now, you got any more funny jokes you gotta tell me?
12725	Janitor	No, ma'am.
12726	J.D.'s Narration	In a hospital, every day is made up of little battles.
12727	Carla	Can I have everyone's attention please? I officially don't care anymore who peed in this jar!
12728	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes you fight them not because you want to, but because you have to....
12729	Carla	Shut up.
12730	J.D.'s Narration	Other times you fight for what you want...
12731	Elliot	Sean, I can't make it to dinner.
12732	J.D.'s Narration	...but what you want isn't willing to wait.
12733	Sean	Sure, Elliot...yeah....
12734	J.D.'s Narration	If you're lucky, there's no battle at all everything works out perfectly.
12735	J.D.	Yo, there he is! For a second I thought you weren't coming, dude.
12736	Bartender	Hey! Turk-&-J.D.! And J.D.!
12737	J.D.	Yeah, I'm so psyched we're doing this, man.
12738	Turk	So am I.
12739	Todd	'Scuse me for a second, fellas. I'm gonna go over there and tell that girl my name's "Beer," then I'm gonna offer her some "beer nuts"! What's up!Mental five.
12740	J.D.	You invited The Todd?
12741	Turk	Dude, we left at the same time. I didn't know what to say to him.
12742	J.D.	But I thought we were gonna, like, reminisce tonight, you know? Get a little deep?
12743	Turk	Me too. I'm totally bummed out, all right?
12744	Todd	Oh, that was the hottest slap I've ever gotten! I can't believe I wasn't gonna come out tonight! Thanks for twisting my arm.
12745	J.D.	I'm outta here.
12746	Todd	Hey!
12747	Turk	J.D. Come on, man! All right, fine, man! I could have plenty of deep moments with The Todd!

12756	Turk	Ever since I got engaged, he's been acting crazier than my fiancee. Although...Carla is going a little nuts about the dress. Dude, what's up with Tracy?
12757	Mr. Quinn	Dude! Tracy's a guy.
12758	Turk	That'd make you gay.
12759	Mr. Quinn	I am gay.

12774	Wendy	Sure.
12775	Carla	Thanks.
12776	Dr. Kelso	Nurse Espinosa. I specifically requested that you transfer Mrs. Merchant to the Morning Side Nursing Home. I'd take her there myself, but then I'd run the risk of bumping into my mother, and the last thing I need is to have another conversation about why she shouldn't have to spend her golden years in a bunk-bed. Now, either do the job we pay you for, or I'll find someone else who will!Oh: Have a great day!

12794	Dr. Cox	How did you get him to stop talking to you?
12795	J.D.	I don't get it, man. All I wanted to do was take you to dinner, and you made me feel like a total idiot.
12796	Dr. Cox	Wait a minute, I _always_ make him feel like an idiot.
12797	Turk	Why you making a big deal about this?
12798	J.D.	You never tell me how you feel!
12799	Dr. Cox	Aw, dammit all! I never tell you how _I_ feel.
12800	J.D.	I'm not talking to you!
12801	Dr. Cox	Finally! Thank you.
12802	J.D.	I don't understand. Ever since I met you it's been like this one-way street. I mean, I-I-I-I tell you everything, and you tell me nothing. I don't get it what are you afraid of?

12807	Elliot	Soooo...thanks to you, Sean blew me off; but I'm okay. Old Elliot would have gone into a tail-spin, but new Elliot's just gonna get him back, because new Elliot is a fixer. Like, that guy over there if his stitches lifted and his spleen ruptured, I would just go over...and fix them!
12808	Guy	My spleen is going to rupture!?
12809	Elliot	Relax, you're fine.You know what? I am just going to show Sean that he will always come first.
12810	Dr. Cox	Gosh, I hate to interrupt this one-gal pep-rally, there, Barbie, but I give this guy two weeks three if you are just terrific in the sack.
12811	Elliot	Well, then it's three!
12812	Dr. Cox	Mm!
12813	Elliot	I mean: You're wrong!
12814	Dr. Cox	You know I just, uh, I just got off the phone with Jordan, who told me that my son rolled over for the first time....
12815	Elliot	Oh, my God! That's so great!
12816	Dr. Cox	Big who cares! Not about Jack rolling over for the first time, but definitely about your reaction to my son rolling over for the first time. Point being that I missed it because I was here. You might want to get a pen out and write this down, because here comes the inside scoop: The hospital comes first. Always.
12817	Elliot	Always?
12818	Dr. Cox	Forever and ever.D'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand everandeverandeverandever You gettin' this? Aaaand everandeverandeverandeveraneverandever....

12822	Dr. Cox	...and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever, andeverandeverandeverandever....
12823	Mr. Quinn	You're not that comfortable with the man-on-man action, are you?
12824	Turk	So I'm a little homophobic.... I mean, we all got our stuff, right? I bet, deep down inside, you're a little racist?
12825	Mr. Quinn	Marrying a black guy?
12826	Turk	Dude, how pissed are your parents, honestly?
12827	Mr. Quinn	So, what makes you so uncomfortable? Is it the sex?
12828	Turk	Don't get me wrong I don't love the idea of kissing anyone with a mustache. That's why I always pretend to have a cold when Carla's aunt comes to town.What really freaks me out, though, is the thought of being that open with another guy any guy. I don't know what it is, I mean that's just the way I been my whole life. Maybe...maybe it's because I'm scared, you know?
12829	Mr. Quinn	Dude...that's a little gay.

12833	Nurse Roberts	Over here, jumpsuit!
12834	Carla	Mr. Thomasberg, let's get you to the lab!
12835	Dr. Cox	Hey, studly! Now, when you were out rooting through the dumpster, you didn't stumble across your own testicles, did'ja?
12836	Janitor	Hey, you know that long line of trembling peons that are so afraid of you? Well I'm not in that line.
12837	Dr. Cox	Oh, you're not?
12838	Janitor	No. I'm not in anybody's line.
12839	Nurse Roberts	_This_ is a Chicklet!
12840	Janitor	I gotta go.
12841	J.D.'s Narration	I'm always happy when someone wins a battle. Because around here, you get your fair share of disappointment.I guess in the end you have to fight for things that really matter. Like pride in your work......or your friendship.
12842	Turk	You know, I'm actually starting to like Journey.
12843	J.D.	Well you're gonna be very pleased with the next twenty-three songs.
12844	Turk	Heh.
12845	J.D.	You know, the fact that you're even here for an end-of-an-era celebration is enough we don't have to, like, get all deep or anything.
12846	Turk	No, I wanna try this, man. Okay, Um.... Ever since Carla and I set the date for the wedding, I started thinking. You know those lame-ass couples that get engaged but they never actually get married they just cruise along, year after year, without making any real kind of commitment?
12847	J.D.	Uh-huh?
12848	Turk	Dude, I wanted to be one of those couples, man!
12849	J.D.	Hey, Puki, can we get two appletinis, please?
12850	J.D.'s Narration	And sometimes, all you can do is grit your teeth and tell the truth.
12851	Sean	Hey.
12852	Elliot	Look, I was planning on coming here and telling you that you'll always come first. But, the truth is that's not a promise I can keep. But the one thing I _can_ guarantee you is that, when it's my decision, I'll always choose you. ...But if that's not enough, I understand.
12853	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12854	J.D.'s Narration	Today started out like any other day....
12855	Sean	Ohhh. Dolphins won again.
12856	Elliot	Mmm.
12857	Sean	Here you go.I'm gonna be hearing about this all day.
12858	J.D.'s Narration	Dr. Cox and Jordan are still looking for a pediatrician....
12859	Dr. Cox	This time, try not to scare off the doctor.
12860	Jordan	I did not scare off the last guy!
12861	Dr. Cox	You bit him.
12862	Jordan	I _tripped_ and my teeth hit his shoulder.
12863	Dr. Cox	Uh-huh. And once that happened, did you clamp down a little bit?Jordan!
12864	Jordan	Well
12865	Dr. Cox	Oh, you come on!
12866	Jordan	Well, he had a bad attitude!
12867	Dr. Norris	Zachary, remember what Mr. Cookiepants always says about blowing your nose: "If it's clear, have no fear; if it's bloody, come see your buddy!" What do you want?
12868	Jordan	Well, we're looking for a new pediatrician for our son....
12869	Dr. Norris	And you figured that, even though my patient load is full, since you're on the board of directors and Dr. Cox here is not only an attending at the hospital but also an internationally renowned pain-in-the-ass, you both could show complete disregard for my schedule and make me want to cause you grievous bodily harm even before we were properly introduced...?
12870	Jordan	Charmed.
12871	J.D.'s Narration	Like I said: Same ol', same ol'.
12872	Janitor	Heh-hah-hah. You drew on the wall. You drew on the wall!
12873	J.D.	You pulled the paper away!
12874	Janitor	Stop lyin'. It's gonna come off, right?
12875	J.D.	Dan, don't! That's dad's indelible space pen! And prom is in like two weeks!Good evening Mr. and Mrs. Shefford. I'm...here to pick up Amy for...prom.Yeah, that that'll come off you won't have to get laser surgery or skin from your ass or anything.
12876	Janitor	Hmm?
12877	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12878	Janitor	Come on!
12879	J.D.'s Narration	In a hospital, lots of things last longer than you wish they would....
12880	J.D.'s Thoughts	Especially certain stupid relationships with stupid Sea World trainers who stole my stupid girl!
12881	Sean	Well, I've, uh, I've got whales to train.
12882	J.D.	Stupid whales.Hey, Sean! Right on, brother!
12883	Sean	Bye.
12884	Elliot	Bye!
12885	Turk	Where the hell are my interns!?
12886	J.D.'s Narration	As third-year residents, you really have to stay on top of your interns.
12887	Turk	These! Right here! You see these names!? They are called patients! This one needs brain work! This one needs a heart!
12888	J.D.	This guy needs courage.
12889	Turk	Helping or hurting, J.D.? Helping or hurting?
12890	Interns	Yes, Dr. Turk.
12891	Female Intern	Dr. Jerk!
12892	J.D.	The girl one just called you "Dr. Jerk"!
12893	Turk	No sweat. You should hear what they call Dr. Michead.
12894	J.D.	...What?
12895	J.D.'s Narration	I decided to take a different tack with my interns.
12896	J.D.	Look, guys, I'm not here to overwork ya, okay? I'm not I'm not just your resident I'm your buddy, I'm your go-to guy.... I'm J.D.
12897	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, my tack had its own drawbacks.
12898	J.D.	But it is crucial I have everyone here at 9 a.m. sharp tomorrow, okay?
12899	Intern 1	Oh, uh...is it cool if I come at 9:30?
12900	J.D.	Absolutely. Anyone else need to be late?
12901	Intern 2	I can't.
12902	Intern 3	Bad for me.
12903	J.D.	Okay, well, why don't we why don't we just make it 10, then? Okay?
12904	Intern 4	I can be here at 9.
12905	J.D.	But I said 10!
12906	J.D.'s Narration	I guess everyone has their own style.
12907	Elliot	Today for lunch, the cafeteria has... Bruce, name a manifestation of normal pressure hydrocephalus!
12908	Bruce	Urinary incontinence!
12909	Elliot	He-hell yes, Bruce! Go place a Foley cath. On Bed 4! As for the rest of Team E, I'm
12910	Dr. Kelso	Well, if it isn't Dr. Haircut and her not-ready-for-primetime players!
12911	Elliot	Actually, sir, we rock, so feel free to sit back and enjoy the show!
12912	Dr. Kelso	Well, don't worry about it, son, those things are a dime a dozen.
12913	Bruce	Really?
12914	Dr. Kelso	In fact, if you get bored, why don't you just hijack an ice cream truck and drive it through our brand new pathology lab? But do me a favor and spare the paper shredder, because I'll need that to turn your next twelve paychecks into a clown wig you can wear for the rest of your internship!Dr. Reid, you may have an exciting new look and a boyfriend who smells vaguely like my tackle-box, but I remain, as always, underwhelmed.
12915	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12916	Dr. Cox	I think, Dr. Norris, what we're looking for is someone who's not too alarmist but also not too lax, either.
12917	Dr. Norris	Oh, God, please let that someone be me!
12918	Jordan	Look, you're obviously a little busy with your doll....
12919	Dr. Norris	My doll? It's a collectible.
12920	Jordan	Someone's gonna get his ass bit!
12921	Dr. Cox	Right.... I think we should probably take off. We're gonna be back to you with our decision.
12922	Dr. Norris	Super. I'll be by my giant pretend phone, pretending to give a crap.
12923	Oh, uh, by the way	Brrring! Helloo? Gotta take it. Uh-huh.... Uh-huh....
12924	Dr. Cox	I love him!
12925	Jordan	Of course you do he's you! And nobody loves you more than you! You know that.
12926	Dr. Cox	Yeah, but, still.... He _is_ the best pediatrician on staff, and since we both work here we're gonna have a lot of pull over him. I mean, come on, Jordan, you haven't let me make one decision about our son. Which is why, by the way, you'll be doing the answering when he asks why daddy's wee-wee doesn't have a turtleneck on it like his.
12927	Jordan	Yeah, fine. Whatever you said.
12928	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12929	J.D.	Hey, Carla? Hey.... I had to redo the NG tube one of your nurses put on Mrs. Hemmel, so if you could spread the word to leave that to me and my guys, it would be great.
12930	Carla	Oh, no problem, Bambi. Oh! But the reason my nurses had to do that is because none of your interns know how. So if you keep flapping your mouth without knowing all the facts, I'm gonna see if I can fit my foot in it!
12931	J.D.	Okay. Good talk!
12932	Brian	You did it for me both times.
12933	J.D.	Jimmy, didn't you do one yesterday?
12934	Jimmy	No, you let me go home 'cause I forgot to set my TiVo for the Styx 'Behind the Music'?
12935	J.D.	Do not miss that! It's awesome! Seth?
12936	J.D.'s Narration	That was when I realized what I'd turned my interns into.
12937	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12938	Elliot	Bruce! This is gonna be your third Foley cath. in a row! You can do this. You didn't need to page me seventeen times between the time I bought the rum-raisin muffin and then...threw it away because alcoholism runs in my family.
12939	Bruce	After this morning, I just wanted to make sure that I _really_ have this down.
12940	Elliot	What are you doing?
12941	Bruce	It's just a nervous habit. It helps me concentrate.
12942	Elliot	Yeah, well, you know what helps me concentrate?
12943	Bruce	Me not doing that?
12944	Elliot	No, bunnies.Mmm.
12945	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12946	Dr. Cox	Say, I don't want to embarrass you, there, Big Jack, but, uh...you've got a little something on your face.Hardly notice it.
12947	Jordan	What was that?
12948	Dr. Cox	Come on, Jordan. Don't tell me you're gonna be one of those parents who makes a big deal out of every single cough.Look out, Michead!
12949	Dr. Michead	Argh!
12950	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12951	Janitor	Okay, tough guy. Good night!What the!? Maybe I diluted this too much.
12952	Doug	Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaagggggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
12953	Janitor	Eh, can't blame the cleanser.
12954	J.D.'s Narration	Even though my interns sucked, I decided to turn it into a positive.
12955	J.D.	Elliot, uh, I need some pointers on how to deal with my interns.
12956	Doug	....aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagggggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh-hagh-haaaaaaaaaaaaggggggggghhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!....
12957	J.D.	Anyway, do you think we could, like, meet up after work or something?
12958	Elliot	Sure. What'd you have in mind?
12959	Sean	No! Don't do it!
12960	J.D.	Nothin' major.
12961	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12962	Dr. Norris	You know, Benjamin, it's not a bad thing that you play with it, it's just that your mom wants you to take breaks for meals!
12963	Dr. Cox	Excuse me, Jack here, uh, Jack here's got a cough. And on account of the meconium problem he had at birth, I'm thinking it just might be pneumonia.
12964	Dr. Norris	Benjamin: Take this cup, fill 'er up, right?What in the hell do you think you are doing? You arrogant son of a bitch, if you ever interrupt an exam of mine again, I will personally take my stethoscope and shove it up yourBenjamin! What happened?
12965	Benjamin	I don't have to go.
12966	Dr. Norris	Oh, well it happens to the big boys, too. Try again. Go on!Is his temperature under a hundred-point-five?
12967	Dr. Cox	Barely.
12968	Dr. Norris	Eating, peeing, pooing?
12969	Dr. Cox	Sometimes all at the same time. Come on, it's a really persistent cough. What do you say?
12970	Dr. Norris	Office hours, tomorrow, 5 o'clock. Bye-bye.
12971	Dr. Cox	I'm gonna go ahead and put this in a language that you can understand: You had better see my son now, or I'm gonna kick your ass.
12972	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12973	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, here she comes. Don't be over-eager!
12974	J.D.	Elliot!!! Over here!!!
12975	Elliot	Hey!
12976	J.D.	Wow...you look great.
12977	Elliot	Thanks.
12978	Sean	Oh, hey, J.D.
12979	J.D.	Hey, Sean's here, everybody.... Hey, Sean! Heeeyyy!
12980	Elliot	You know, since he's a trainer, Sean is really good with behavior and communication. I mean, he helped me so much with my interns that I thought maybe he could help you with yours.
12981	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, stay calm at least she's here, too.
12982	Elliot	Oh, Bruce again gotta go.
12983	Sean	Mm-hmm.Bye.This'll be fun!
12984	J.D.'s Narration	And just like that, I had another rough night ahead of me.At least I wasn't the only one.
12985	Elliot	You paged me for another Foley catheter?
12986	Bruce	I'm great at these now!
12987	Elliot	Oh!
12988	Bruce	Just watch this one.
12989	Dr. Kelso	Don't mind if I do!
12990	J.D.'s Narration	Yep, it's gonna be a long, long night.
12991	Elliot	I'm, heh, right here, Bruce.
12992	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12993	Dr. Cox	Hello, David. I've been expecting you.
12994	Dr. Norris	Agh!
12995	Dr. Cox	Yeah, I just thought I'd come by and play with some of your stuffed animals and, I know, I know, they're "for the kids", heh. Also, wanted to let you know that I _will_ be bringing my son by this _morning_.
12996	Dr. Norris	Yeah, I don't think so, there, chief.Where's Mr. Cookiepants?
12997	Dr. Cox	Oh, que pasa?
12998	Dr. Norris	I said, Where's Mr. Cookiepants!?
12999	Dr. Cox	He's in a safe place, Dave.
13000	Dr. Norris	If you touch one hair on his head, I swear to God I'll inject your kid with chickenpox!
13001	Dr. Cox	No, you won't.
13002	Dr. Norris	I know.
13003	Dr. Cox	No, David. It's a collectible.
13004	Dr. Norris	Whatever.
13005	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13006	Elliot	The kid's a good doctor, he just...falls apart every time Kelso looks over his shoulder.
13007	Sean	Well, why don't you just tell Kelso to back off?
13008	Elliot	I-I've taken a lot of positive steps this year but when it comes to standing up to Kelso, I just...I can't get over that hump yet. He's like my white whale.
13009	Sean	Yeah.... Mine's Frank.
13010	Elliot	Oh, no, I meant like in 'Moby Dick' Kelso is a giant pain in my ass.
13011	Sean	Oh. Well, thing is, I love Frank. Just...he can drive me crazy every now and then.Every day! Every day! ...Every day!
13012	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13013	Sean	Hey, J.D.? I was thinking we'd start out by me, you know, watching how you interact with your interns. Uh, and then, you kn your brain's gonna tell you to be a little self-conscious, but you just need to ignore the voice in your head.
13014	J.D.'s Thoughts	Kick him in the crotch and run.
13015	J.D.	I'll try, Sean!
13016	Elliot	You be nice to the teacher, okay? I'm sleeping with him.Oh, my God! I haven't said that since college!
13017	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13018	Dr. Cox	Mmmmgh! Norris hasn't budged, and he just moved the appointment back to six, the rat-bastard!
13019	Jordan	Watch your language in front of the kid, you stupid bicky-bicky!You see, _I_ am adapting. You, on the other hand, are behaving like a complete lunatic.
13020	Dr. Cox	No, I'm not!
13021	Jordan	Carla?
13022	Carla	Hm?
13023	Jordan	You're one of them bossy-pants types who always tells people their problems whether they ask for it or not, right?
13024	Carla	I like to think I've learned when to hold back.
13025	Jordan	You're in.
13026	Carla	You've totally lost sight of what's important, here. You are a parent now, okay? You don't come first anymore
13027	Jordan	No.
13028	Carla	you've got to do what's best for your son, even if it means sucking up to the one doctor on earth who's more obnoxious than you are.
13029	Jordan	Well....
13030	Carla	Oh, my God. I loved doing that so much, it makes my hand shake a little!
13031	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13032	Elliot	So, how are your interns doing?
13033	Doug	Hey, yeah, it still burns a little, but at least I can hear okay.
13034	Dr. Kelso	Fantastic, sport. But that's the brachial artery and it's not how we draw blood. Now, if we need to inject him with heroin, you'll be the first one I call.
13035	Elliot	Dr. Kelso...
13036	Dr. Kelso	What is it, Dr. Reid? Do you have something to say?
13037	Elliot	...No.
13038	Dr. Kelso	You know, son, you remind me of her so much, you're just a break-down in the supply closet away from being the same person!
13039	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13040	J.D.	Look, Brian, if you're having that much trouble with your case report, I'd be glad to take a look at it for you, pal.
13041	Brian	Cool. Try to have it back by 5.
13042	J.D.	O...kay. I have a lot of things to do...but....
13043	Sean	Hey, J.D.? Can I offer a little constructive criticism?
13044	J.D.'s Thoughts	Kick him in the crotch, dammit! The crotch!
13045	Sean	You know, you're worried so much about whether your interns like you or not that I don't think they respect you very much.
13046	Turk	I had one of mine run out this morning and get me some dome wax. Check it zing!
13047	Sean	That's really shiny.
13048	Turk	Yeah!
13049	Sean	You know, I had the same problem when I started working with the dolphins
13050	J.D.	Okay, that's it. I-I-I'm sorry, Sean, I'm a doctor, okay? I-I'm teaching humans, not dolphins, okay? So it isn't really helpful for me to know what works on fish.
13051	Sean	They're mammals, actually.
13052	J.D.	Oh, well, Sean! Unfortunately for me, my interns aren't mammals!
13053	Sean	J.D., they are.
13054	J.D.	S-sh I don't care, Sean!Come on, Turk!
13055	Turk	Hey. I just wanted you to know I don't have a problem with you, I just can't resist a good storm-off.
13056	Sean	Oh, who can?
13057	Janitor	Stain, I won't lie to ya this is gonna hurt a little bit.
13058	Turk	Why don't you just paint over it?
13059	Janitor	Hm!
13060	J.D.	Can you believe that crap Sean was saying?
13061	Turk	He was right. Even in college, you cared way too much about everybody liking you.
13062	Guy	Hey, who wants to help me move?
13063	J.D.	Me!
13064	Girl	J.D., could you walk my dog tonight while I have casual sex with your friend, Miguel?
13065	J.D.	Love to!
13066	Same Guy	Hey. Who wants to help me move back?
13067	J.D.	I know where it all goes...!
13068	Turk	Think about it, man. Cox has taught you the most since you've been here, right? Do you really think he gives a damn whether you like him or not?
13069	J.D.	I'd like to think so.
13070	Dr. Cox	Out of my way, space-waster!
13071	Turk	I felt the love.

13073	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13074	Dr. Cox	Enjoy.
13075	Dr. Norris	Well, if you want, you could give that one to me and I could fix it. And have it...for the kids.
13076	Dr. Cox	Disturbing fetishes aside, I I feel like I owe you an apology on account of acting like a jackass. But I don't think that my son should be the one who has to pay for it.
13077	Dr. Norris	You actually think that I would endanger the health of a child because you're a jackass? Look, buddy, most of the parents I deal with are jackasses; now, don't get me wrong, you're in the top five.
13078	Dr. Cox	Thank you!
13079	Dr. Norris	You're welcome. So, the reason why I have yet to see your child is because he has the sniffles.
13080	Dr. Cox	The sniffles?
13081	Dr. Norris	The sniffles! Look, you're a doctor, you have what I like to call The Burden of Knowledge you're gonna be worse than every parent who freaks out because their kid eats Play-Doh. Why? Because you've seen too much; you've seen what can really go wrong. If you can get a handle on that, it's gonna gross you.
13082	Dr. Cox	You have kids?
13083	Dr. Norris	One. She hates dolls.
13084	Dr. Cox	Boy, that's a bummer.
13085	Dr. Norris	Tell me about it.
13086	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13087	Dr. Kelso	That's horrible work. Horrible!
13088	Elliot	Dr. Kelso, I do have something to say.Remember earlier, you asked me if I had something to say?
13089	Dr. Kelso	No!
13090	Elliot	Well, you did. And...the reason that I came back here is because you said that Bruce and I are alike. And you know what? You're right. Because you're treating him the exact same way you treated me when I first got here!
13091	Dr. Kelso	Is that how you feel, future dentist?
13092	Bruce	W-well...sometimes you make me feel like...I can't do anything well, and I can do lots of things well!
13093	Dr. Kelso	Like what?
13094	Bruce	I'm a pretty solid human beat-box.
13095	Elliot	Bru-Bruce, I think he was talking about medical...things.
13096	Dr. Kelso	No, no-no, I-I'd like to hear him demonstrate this "beef-box" thing.
13097	Bruce	Well well, o-okay. Uh, I g I guess this one goes out to my boy, Wayne, in room 302. He has fluid in his lungs.
13098	Dr. Kelso	Young man! ...Enjoy your moment.
13099	Elliot	Oh, my God, Bruce! That was amazing! Where did you learn how to do that?
13100	Bruce	In temple.

13102	Sean	You're right I can totally see my reflection!
13103	Turk	Tell your friends, baby!

13105	Carla	Damn straight, you do! You know what your problem is, Bambi? You'reOh! Turk! Please? Just one more second? I need the rush! Please?
13106	Sean	J.D., it's no big deal. We both know that it wasn't about that. Well, you...you like Elliot.
13107	J.D.	Sorry.
13108	Sean	Don't sweat it.
13109	J.D.	You're not pissed off? I'd be pissed off. Why aren't you pissed off?
13110	Sean	I dunno. I guess I just...I don't see you as that much of a threat.
13111	J.D.	Ohh.... Cool.
13112	J.D.'s Narration	I don't care. All that matters is finding a way to sleep at night....painting over your black spot......or imagining Shamu taking Sean's arm off.You don't need a doctor to tell you that a good night's sleep can fix almost anything.
13113	Bruce's refrain	He's got fluid.

13115	J.D.'s Narration	Hospitals are hectic. But there's a certain time every morning, after the bedpans have been emptied, that a calm washes over the place; and you can't help but feel peaceful.
13116	J.D.	Holy Vishnu! Look, we've been working together a while, could you not whistle at me?
13117	Dr. Cox	You're right, Newbie, we have been working together for a while. Of course, I wouldn't know the exact number of days unless I consulted my Friends For Life calendar that I keep taped inside my hope chest. Still....
13118	J.D.'s Narration	I've learned to make Dr. Cox's rants work for me.I catch up on paperwork; I look after patients...
13119	J.D.	Carla, can you check room air pulse ox on Mrs. Shipp?
13120	Carla	You got it, Bambi.
13121	J.D.'s Narration	...I take care of those official things that just have to get done.
13122	Janitor	You're a jerk.
13123	J.D.	_You're_ a jerk!
13124	Dr. Cox	...Long story short, there, Molly, I will always whistle at you like you're a blonde with big bombs and I'm a construction worker just released from prison. That clear?
13125	J.D.	Crystal!
13126	Dr. Cox	Super!
13127	J.D.	Uh, listen, while I have you here I'm applying for a fellowship, and I could really use a letter of recommendation. I was thinking that, when you wrote it, instead of using a girl's name you could refer to me as "Dr. Dorian." I think it sounds a little more professional and, frankly, each time you call me a girl's name, I die a little inside.
13128	Dr. Cox	Look, Janice, Denise, Tiffany Amber Thiiiieeeessen! Lemme go ahead and share a little something special with you that I like to call Perry's Perspective. One: If someone's standing in front of me in line at the coffee shop and they can't decide what they want in the half an hour it took to get to the register, I should be allowed to kill them. Two: I'm fairly sure if they took porn off the internet, there'd only be one website left, and it'd be called "Bring back the porn!" Three and most importantly of all: The only way to be respected as a doctor nay, respected as a man is to be an island; you are born alone, you damn sure die alone. Isn't that right, spike?The point is, and you just might want to jot this down: only the weak need help.
13129	J.D.	I should get that tattooed on my neck.
13130	Dr. Kelso	Good afternoon, Sacred Heart!
13131	Dr. Steadman	Hey! Your Chief of Medicine just said good afternoon, people!
13132	J.D.'s Narration	Dr. Jeffrey Steadman world-class suck-up. Especially since the residency director position opened up.
13133	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Cox, you know Dr. Steadman.
13134	Dr. Cox	You're a doctor? Here, all this time I had thought that you were some kind of parasitic creature who lived shoulder-deep inside Big Bob's colon.
13135	Dr. Steadman	If only, sir.
13136	J.D.	Well, I'm off to fluid rounds.To fluid rounds!
13137	Elliot	Mm! In the new Sea World dolphin show, Sean opens with this impression of a blowfish that will totally crack you guys up! Show them.
13138	Sean	All right.
13139	J.D.	What the hell, that's not funny! All he did was this
13140	Sean	Hey, you're not doing it right.
13141	J.D.'s Narration	It's never fun being the fifth wheel, especially when one of those wheels is Elliot's boyfriend. Still, I had decided to take the high road.
13142	Sean	Hey, J.D., is this regular? I asked you to bring me a diet.
13143	J.D.	That is diet....
13144	Sean	I don't understand! I'm so careful about what I eat, I'm I just keep putting on weight!
13145	Elliot	It's all the regular soda, Sean!
13146	J.D.	Enjoy.
13147	J.D.'s Thoughts	Muahahahahahahaha!
13148	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13149	Sean	So, I'm leaving the day after tomorrow, uh, to work on this project studying the fishing industry's impact on Maui dolphins. Uh, they're an endangered species; if something isn't done soon they could actually be wiped off the face of the earth.
13150	Turk	Mmm.
13151	Carla	Ohh.
13152	J.D.	Fascinating stuff, Sean.
13153	Sean	Oh, hey I used to date that girl.
13154	J.D.'s Thoughts	Hello, boys.
13155	Elliot	Hi, I'm Elliot. So, uh, you guys used to date?
13156	Sean's Ex	Nice to see you, Sean.
13157	Sean	You, too, Mary...Angel...izabeth...?
13158	J.D.'s Thoughts	Goodbye, boys....
13159	Sean	You know, it's always awkward when you run into an ex, isn't it?
13160	Turk	Tell me about it. I don't know how J.D. and Elliot do it.
13161	Sean	Do what?
13162	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, no! I've got to stop this! Kick him!
13163	Carla	Oh!
13164	Turk	You okay, baby?
13165	Carla	Yeah....

13175	Janitor	Troy! We're listening.
13176	J.D.	Two coins add up to thirty cents and one of them is not a nickel.
13177	Janitor	So what are they?
13178	J.D.	It's a _riddle_. You figure it out.

13185	Turk	Your tongue went counter-clockwise!
13186	Carla	No!Green scrubs!
13187	Turk	Ohhhh.
13188	Carla	I'm covering for one of the surgical nurses. We could use the extra cash, plus we get to work side-by-side for the next two whole days. Isn't that great!

13193	Elliot	So, J.D. and I slept together. It's not that big a deal.
13194	Sean	You know Betty from work I see her every day, right? How would you feel if I told you _we_ slept together?
13195	Elliot	Well, I'd be disturbed, Sean, because Betty is a harp seal.
13196	Sean	Yeah, but a harp seal who's smart, funny, and totally gets me!
13197	Elliot	Oh, my God! Is anyone in more hell than me right now?
13198	Todd	Dude. We're goin' to the caf. so I can tell all the boys about my date with Strangely Attractive Intern! You in?

13205	Jordan	Oh, no, no, she's got great, huge, perky credentials. She's out. Besides, she's too expensive.
13206	Dr. Cox	About that, now, um, I've actually been thinking about going after that residency director job.
13207	Jordan	Residency director?
13208	Dr. Cox	Yeah-heah!
13209	Jordan	But Perry, you realize if you did that, you would be taking a positive step in your life.
13210	Dr. Cox	I...I know.
13211	Jordan	Quick: First place we made love?
13212	Dr. Cox	Oh, gimme a break. We've never..."_made love_".
13213	Jordan	Whew, it is you. I'm so proud I could poo.
13214	Dr. Cox	No, no!
13215	Jordan	Yes!
13216	Dr. Cox	No! I'm serious, Jordan, I don't believe in it. I'd make you swear on a Bible, but I know how contact with holy stuff makes your skin sizzle. So just...promise me?
13217	Jordan	Oh, fine no help.

13225	J.D.	Good evening, Elliot! This is your great aunt Sally. Are you there?
13226	Elliot	I have to get that.
13227	Sean	Nuh-uh.
13228	J.D.	I guess you're at Sean's. Hey, good thing we're so crazy close, or I wouldn't know how to impersonate your aunt Sally! By the way, I ran into Eye Patch this morning said to tell you, "Honka! Honka!"

13234	Janitor	Okay.... You gave me a penny...and...what appears to be a button, on which you've written twenty-nine cents.

13240	Dr. Cox	Fair enough. I'm gonna go ahead and write you a prescription for two testicles; and you feel free to get this filled out whenever you wantbut right now, I'm goin' after that residency director gig, and you're joining me for a really stupid board member meet-and-greet.

13261	Sean	Elliot, I don't...I don't hate you. Okay? I'm I'm not even that mad at you.
13262	Elliot	You're not?
13263	Sean	No. How do I explain this.... You know when you have really bad news to give to someone? So you try to make them look like the bad guy by taking a small thing and blowing it way out of proportion?
13264	Elliot	Totally. So glad that has nothing to do with us!
13265	Sean	Elliot, the trip that I'm leaving on tomorrow...it's actually a lot longer than I let on.
13266	Elliot	What, like three days?

13275	Man	So, the wife and I ended up buying Egyptian cotton bed sheets!
13276	Dr. Cox	Gee, you're too much. What's the thread count on those bad boys?

13278	Man	Uh, gotta go.
13279	Dr. Kelso	Well, well, well.... Snip my pickle and call me schlo-mo!You're not actually applying for residency director.
13280	Dr. Cox	Oh, I don't know, Bob. Here, I like to think I've accomplished plenty of things much more difficult than this. Why, just yesterday morning I somehow managed to hack into your voice-mail and change the outgoing message to, "Hi, this is Big Bob. Why, I'm not in right now but, at the beep, leave your name and your penis size!"
13281	Dr. Kelso	Perry, have you ever wondered why you've never risen above clinical staff at this hospital? I mean, come on, pal, who do you think the board listens to concerning promotions around here? Why don't I tell you after the beep?

13290	Carla	Yeah!
13291	Turk	But you know what? Schmitty heard that Nurse Green's been dying to cover surgery, and I said you wouldn't mind if she took your place tomorrow. Because, between me and you, Schmitty's been trying to hit that for like a minute, and I had to hook him up! You understand, right?
13292	Carla	Sure. Mm-hmm. I'm...I'm glad we could help Schmitty hit that!
13293	Turk	Yeah.
13294	J.D.'s Narration	Relationships can be tricky. Especially the ones that have barely begun.
13295	Sean	Look, Elliot, I'm crazy about you, but I've been going over this in my head all week. I've been in a long-distance relationship before, and it was a disaster. I've reached the point where I honestly believe a couple has a better chance if they just cut the cord and know that if it's meant to be, fate will bring them back together. You know?
13296	Elliot	Yeah.... Totally....
13297	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13298	J.D.'s Thoughts	It's typical. Elliot's in a relationship, so I can't stop thinking about her. I just have to accept it and move on.

13309	Turk	Gastric bypass?
13310	Dr. Wen	Mm-hmm.
13311	Turk	I'm goin' to the show?
13312	Dr. Wen	Well, you've earned it you really turned it up a notch in surgery yesterday. I don't know if you had a lucky charm in that room, or what, but something was different.
13313	Turk	Hey! Hey, Baby! What's up? You know, I've been thinking: that _was_ a lot of fun working together.
13314	Carla	Mm-hmmmm. And how long you been thinking about that?
13315	Turk	Ever since Dr. Wen offered me a gastric bypass because I was so amazing yesterday, and I realized you're the reason why.
13316	Carla	Really?
13317	Turk	Yeah! Yeah. It's just like in high school I had this girlfriend who annoyed the crap out of me, but every time she came to one of my basketball games, I played like crazy out of my mind because all of a sudden I was playing for her. I wanted to make her proud. You understand what I'm saying?
13318	Carla	You're saying I'm so annoying you can't stand working with me for even two days, but now that you have something to gain, you want me back.
13319	Turk	Exactly. Thank you!
13320	Carla	I didn't hear an apology anywhere in there!
13321	Nurse Roberts	All I heard was nonsense.
13322	Turk	The truth is, you never asked me how I felt about us working together. Plus, you embarrassed me in front of my co-workers. You were a pain.
13323	Carla	You know what? Maybe I was a pain, but do you know how many times you're a pain and I just let it go? Like when we're at home and you follow me from room to room, even when I go to the bathroom!

13331	Carla	But the biggest pain of all is that you know I'd go into that operating room with you if you just apologized; but you're too stubborn to do that, aren't you.

13334	Dr. Cox	Tell me this, there, pippy: Are you allergic to bee stings?
13335	J.D.	I don't know. Why?
13336	Dr. Cox	Oh, it's just that it looks so painful and possibly infected that I must flick it!
13337	J.D.	You know what? Okay? This never would have happened if my Hairmet hadn't gotten stolen at your stupid suck-up fest last night!Now, I took the liberty of writing the recommendation you promised me.All you have to do is sign right below where it says, "He makes me proud to be a doctor," and right above where it says, "P.S. He ain't too hard on the eyes, either!"
13338	Dr. Cox	Tell you what, Newbie: This must be a very...very proud day for ya.
13339	J.D.	You can't make me feel guilty for asking for help. That's just the way the world works, okay? A-and you know what? Most people actually like helping out the people around them.Take Carla, for instance! Don't you think she'd do anything in the world to help out Turk, no matter what the situation?
13340	Carla	Look! He didn't apologize! So just back the hell off, okay!He messes up and I'm the one who gets...
13341	J.D.	Still, I don't even believe that you think asking for help makes you look weak; I think you don't do it because you're afraid of putting yourself out there. And that's why you're never gonna get anywhere.Thank you for this!

13343	Elliot	Laverne, did you ever notice that in hospitals, even though you're surrounded by like hundreds of people, it's still so easy to get lost in your own thoughts?
13344	Nurse Roberts	Have you been drinkin'?
13345	Elliot's Thoughts	What's wrong with me? Here I am trying not to let fear ruin my life anymore, and then Sean moves away and I don't even have the guts to tell him how I feel.
13346	J.D.'s Thoughts	...how I feel. I mean, life's too short not to go for it with Elliot. Plus, now Sean's out of the picture? Stop being such a chicken!
13347	Turk's Thoughts	...such a chicken! I know it's a complicated procedure, but I can do it without Carla there! What am I so scared of?
13348	Dr. Cox's Thoughts	...what am I so scared of? That I might actually get this job, and have no one to blame it on if I fail? Good Lord, I'm pathetic! When was the last time...
13349	Carla's thoughts	...when was the last time he ever apologized for anything? I wanna help him, I do, but in a lot of ways I guess I'm as stubborn as he is. I wish I could make some sense out of...

13358	Elliot	Sean! Sean! Okay.... Look, I know you hate long-distance relationships, but six months is nothing! I mean, it'll be hard and we'd be going a long time without sex, but I can totally go that long without sex! Sean, I am a sex camel! Look, the point is I'm not ready for this relationship to end; so, even if you break my heart right now, it's okay, because I'd regret it more if I didn't take this shot. So, what do you say?

13363	J.D.	Nope, nope, nope. The correct answer is: A quarter and a nickel.
13364	Janitor	Uh, no. Because you said one of 'em _isn't_ a nickel.

13371	Dr. Kelso	So, shall we all just agree that Dr. Steadman is our new residency director and get the hell out of here?
13372	Dr. Steadman	If anyone wants to stop by my condo to celebrate, my husband made sangria!
13373	Dr. Kelso	Mmmmmmmm!
13374	Dr. Cox	Howdy, fellas. Don't ya don't ya dare get up I don't want to see any broken hips.
13375	J.D.'s Narration	A lot of times, pride can be pretty hard to swallow.
13376	Dr. Cox	Would you please help me?
13377	Jordan	So! I think we should make Perry residency director.
13378	Dr. Kelso	You honestly think the board would pick him because you had his love-baby?
13379	Jordan	Oh, I don't know.... Of course, if they don't, I'm gonna bitch and moan about it until these nice gentlemen are dead.
13380	Board Member	All those in favor of Dr. Cox?
13381	Other Members	Aye.

13384	Dr. Cox	Oh, golly, God!
13385	J.D.'s Narration	But still, in a good relationship, pride never gets in the way.

13396	Guy	Here, buddy. Baby wasn't mine.
13397	J.D.	What the hell...?
13398	Janitor	It's a riddle! Two guys destroyed your bike with a crowbar and a bat. One of 'em wasn't me!
13399	Elliot	Oh, J.D.!
13400	J.D.	Elliot, there's something I have to tell you.
13401	Sean	Hey, buddy!
13402	Elliot	Sean's taking a later flight tomorrow because we decided to make this long-distance thing work! I'm so happy, I can't stop crying!
13403	Sean	Oh, those are nice!
13404	J.D.	Ohh, these? Uhh, I thought Elliot would be sad with you guys splitting up, so I just wanted to....
13405	Elliot	Oh, that's so sweet! You can just put them next to Sean's.
13406	Sean	Yeah.
13407	J.D.	Okay.... I'm not sure they....
13408	Sean	You okay?
13409	Elliot	Yeah....
13410	J.D.	Not sure they can...reach the water, but....
13411	Elliot	J.D.?
13412	Sean	Huh....

13414	J.D.'s Narration	As a doctor, it's important to know how to make small talk.
13415	J.D.	Mr. Bober, what would you like with your turkey sandwich?
13416	Mr. Bober	Pickles!
13417	J.D.'s Narration	...Of course, it's harder if your patient suffers from dementia and can only say one word....
13418	J.D.	And to drink?
13419	Mr. Bober	Pickles!
13420	J.D.	And now, for a thousand dollars and this bag of I.V. fluid, which is guaranteed to make you feel like you're a hundred and ninety again, What did Peter Piper pick a peck of?
13421	Mr. Bober	Pickles.
13422	J.D.	Oooooooh! I'm sorry, Mr. Bober! The correct answer is _peppers_. "Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled _peppers_."
13423	Dr. Cox	NEWBIE!
13424	J.D.	Huh?
13425	Dr. Cox	Did I just walk in on you mocking an innocent patient!?
13426	J.D.	Yes....
13427	Dr. Cox	I've never felt closer to you.
13428	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13429	J.D.	Well, on the plus side, his temperature's 99.9, so...Sayonara, Mr. Bober!
13430	Dr. Cox	Oh, I could just give you a hug! Of course, I never would! I could, but I never would, God save me! I never would...
13431	J.D.'s Thoughts	Eh, no biggie. 'Cause here comes my dream girl with a smile just for me.
13432	Elliot	J.D.... You know what I love?
13433	J.D.	What?
13434	Elliot	My boyfriend Sean.
13435	J.D.'s Narration	And that's when I made one of the biggest mistakes I've made in some time....
13436	J.D.	I'm really bummed out about Elliot. I just needed someone to talk to.
13437	J.D.'s Narration	I called my brother.
13438	Dan	Yeah, boo-frickin'-hoo. Listen, I'm so glad you called. You know how Mom's getting remarried again for the seventh time? Well, this is turning into such a hassle for me....
13439	J.D.'s Narration	And with that, I had reopened the door that I had successfully closed years ago.
13440	J.D.	Yes, Dan, I got your eleven messages. Now, because you're my brother, I'm gonna put this nicely: Leave me alone.
13441	Dan	This whole Mom thing doesn't bother you?
13442	J.D.	Yes, it's killing me. So much so that I have to go, okay?
13443	Dan	All right, buddy. I'll see you soon.Real soon.
13444	J.D.	Wait! Dan! Hoog!
13445	Turk	'Sup, Dan.
13446	Dan	Christopher! Looks like we have the makings of a dog-pile here.

13450	Elliot	I miss Sean.
13451	Carla	Awww.
13452	Elliot	This long-distance thing is killing me.
13453	Carla	Well, are you having phone-sex?
13454	Elliot	Uhhh, gross!
13455	Carla	Last year, when he went home for the holidays, I gave him a call. You'd be surprised at how much Turk's eleven-year-old nephew sounds like him...and how worldly he is.
13456	Elliot	Yeah, well I'm not comfortable doing it here, anyway. I mean, these walls are so thin, that guy next door listens to every single thing I say.Yeah, I can hear you, there, breathing!You sick bastard!
13457	Carla	Look, you just need to find a place where you're not so self-conscious.
13458	Elliot	Hi, Sweetie. Are you naked? ... Okay, ummm, now imagine me taking off my shirt and kissing down your neck and Can you hear me? Sean? ... Good. Okay, now I'm at your chest and my tongue starts Are you there? ... Good, because now I am licking your nipples all over. ... Your nipples. ... Nipples, Sean! I'm licking your nipples!

13462	J.D.	Dude, we have to get my brother out of here he's driving me crazy.
13463	Dan	I did not repeat, did not just drop a toothbrush in the toilet.
13464	Turk	Was it blue?
13465	Dan	Yellow.
13466	Turk	Oh, don't sweat it. So, Mrs. D.'s getting remarried, huh?
13467	Dan	Ugh, yeah!To a loser! Total loser. This guy's making me move out of Mom's attic.
13468	J.D.	Oh, the audacity.
13469	Dan	I know. But you know what? This is gonna be great. You know, this reminds me of the time I came down to see you guys when you were in med school.... Oh! And I hooked up with that slutty chick! Remember, the one with the huge cans? What was her name?
13470	J.D.	Amy.
13471	Dan	Yeah! How do you remember stuff like that?
13472	J.D.	She was my girlfriend.

13478	Dan	Hey! Hey! Check this out! Turk and I have been working on our harmonizing.A-one, a-two, a-one, two three:
13479	J.D.	Haunting.
13480	Dan	You've always had the talent, little brother. You get in on this, and we could take this on the road!
13481	J.D.	I love the theatre....
13482	Turk	Ah! Come to papa!
13483	J.D.	Turk! Can you please not put your skivvies in the freezer!? I'm sick of my popsicles tasting like fabric softener!
13484	Turk	I like my bad boys to stay nice and cold.
13485	Dan	Make sure you're nice and dry down there, otherwise you get a tongue-on-the-flagpole situation you don't want that.
13486	Turk	Ahhhhhh!
13487	J.D.	This is a stimulating conversation. I can't imagine why Mom's new husband doesn't want you in the house.
13488	Dan	Me neither! And you know what, J.D.? I'm worried, 'cause I think this marriage might actually stick.
13489	J.D.	They did?
13490	Dan	Oh, yeah, yeah. Matter of fact, the only reason you were born is 'cause Mom bounced a check at the market.
13491	J.D.	Oh, that's great! I I guess you're only here because Mom wrecked the car?
13492	Dan	No, they wanted me.
13493	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13494	Turk	Hey! My nephew just asked what you're wearing today. How cute is that?
13495	Carla	Not as cute as you think.Hey.
13496	Elliot	Carla.... I've gotta scrape some cash together to see Sean.
13497	Dr. Kelso	Okay, everyone, listen up: It came to my attention that Dr. Brogan here has been moonlighting over at County Medical. Now, if he were to kill someone over there, great; but if he were to make a mistake here because of how tired he was from working at his other job, then my hospital would be liable. So, Ted, why don't you tell everyone what my policy on moonlighting is.
13498	Lawyer	No...moonlighting.
13499	Dr. Kelso	Now, Dr. Brogan will be suspended _without pay_ for one week, but on the plus side, he gets to run around in my backyard wearing a foam suit so I can see if my dog Baxter's attack classes were worth the money!
13500	Doc	Yeah, uh-huh.
13501	Doc 2	Yes, sir.
13502	Turk	Uh-huh.
13503	Carla	Absolutely, sir. Absolutely.
13504	Elliot	No moonlighting, sir!So, where do you guys moonlight?
13505	Female Doc	Insurance physicals.
13506	Male Doc	Free clinic.
13507	Turk	Mammogram-mobile. Well, not officially I just got the offer today but I'd make more money than I do now, riding around in an ambulance, and even though I'll be handling breasts all day, my beautiful fiancee, who is very secure with the will let meI ride around in an ambulance.
13508	J.D.'s Narration	Dan wanted to come with me to work today, but I told him it would make me a little uncomfortable. He was okay with it.
13509	Dan	Now, I heard there's a bed in the on-call room. You ever get, uh, hot & heavy in there?
13510	J.D.	Nah, usually I'm in there by myself.
13511	Dan	So, yes.
13512	J.D.	Oh, thank God.Dr. Cox! You remember my brother Dan?
13513	Dan	Whatta ya say, Coxy!
13514	Dr. Cox	Nothing!
13515	Dan	That's a first.
13516	J.D.	This is my boss, Dan.
13517	Dr. Cox	You know what a boss is: For you, that would be the seventeen-year-old that tells you to clean out the grease-trap after you've filled all the ketchups.
13518	Dan	Oh, my ribs!
13519	J.D.	Uh, Dan, why don't you go get a snack cake?
13520	Dan	Snack cake.
13521	J.D.	Uh, Dr. Cox, Dan was wondering if he could trail with us today....
13522	Dr. Cox	Good God in heaven, Newbie, there are just so very many ways for me to say this to you: Never; not in a million years; absolutely not; no way, Jose; no chance, Lance; niet; negatory; mm-mm; nuh-uh; oh-oh; and of course my own personal favorite of all time, man falling off of a cliff "Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!..."
13523	J.D.	Look, Dr. Cox...
13524	Dr. Cox	..."Pff."
13525	J.D.	I just want to say, thank you.
13526	Dr. Cox	Hold the phone. You don't want him to come with us?
13527	J.D.	"Nooooooooo..." Heh. "Poof." Heh.

13530	Elliot	Thanks a lot, Turk! I didn't get that mammogram-mobile job because they said you took it after all!
13531	Carla	What!?
13532	Turk	Yes, I took it! But, it pays better, and we both know that this job is about helping women detect breast cancer, and nothing more!
13533	Carla	Well, have fun! 'Cause you'll never see "the girls" again!Hey, Elliot, the place where I moonlight pays pretty well. I can call them for you.
13534	Elliot	Cool! What's the gig?
13535	Carla	It's great. It's just emergency patch and fix work it's no different than treating a patient at our hospital, okay?
13536	Elliot	Okay.
13537	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13538	Dr. Cox	Oh-ho! Lookie here! Uh, tell me sir, what is it that brings Dr. Dorian's favorite gomer back to the hospital?
13539	Mr. Bober	Pickles.
13540	Dr. Cox	Fair enough.
13541	Dan	What's a gomer?
13542	J.D.	A gomer's an old person that takes up room in the hospital and doesn't have the common decency to die.
13543	Dan	See, now that's just rude is what that is.
13544	J.D.	Well, I'm sorry, dude, I don't I don't have time for pickles right now. I got three vegetables and a drug addict who's gonna tell me this time things'll be different, then try to take my watch again.Dammit!
13545	Dr. Cox	Not gonna be necessary, seeing as how his temperature is below a hundred. Take him away.
13546	Dan	So, Dr. Cox, how long has my little brother had the desire to smother old people? I feel I should warn Grandma.
13547	Dr. Cox	Gonna sound a little dark, but in all fairness you gotta deal with this place any way you can.
13548	Dan	Dude, these are living, breathing people we're talking about here.
13549	Dr. Cox	I'm s I'm s I'm sorry, I'm sorry, what do you do?
13550	Dan	I tend bar.
13551	Dr. Cox	Well, I'll tell you what, there, Dan: I'm gonna go ahead and worry about how we do things around here. But if I ever do need to find out how to make a top-notch rum and coke, well, by gum, mister, you had better be by the phone, cause I just might give you a jingle.Ba-ha-rrrri-hing! Hi, Dan?

13553	Carla	Okay, we have another dog coming in. Do you want him or the four cats next door?
13554	Elliot	Oh, I'll go with the dog. I don't know what it is, but all cats hate me. I mean, if I even make eye contact with them, they freak out.
13555	Carla	Okay.
13556	Dr. Kelso	Well, well, well....

13559	J.D.	Well, Dan, what can I say. It's been, uh, three days....
13560	Dan	Two days.
13561	J.D.	Feels like three. But, uh, say hi to Wayne, and good luck in the bumper pool tournament.
13562	Dan	Yeah, actually, J.D., I don't think I'm leaving.
13563	J.D.	Why!?
13564	Dan	Well, 'cause I'm worried about you. I mean, hanging with you today and watching you work, with the gomer talk and all the attitude now, I'm not so sure I like the guy you're turning into. It's definitely not my little brother.
13565	J.D.	You know what, Dan, once Dad left and Mom started marrying everyone that rang the doorbell, I remember someone saying how lucky I was to have an older brother. But you never came through for me once, did you. I mean, I called you for help because I'm in love with a girl who's in love with someone else, and you responded by showing up here, drinking all my Bailey's Irish Cream, and whining about Mom's new boyfriend. You are a self-involved user, Dan. And you wanna tell _me_ what kind of person to be? I tell you what, instead, why don't you just get the hell out of my life?
13566	Dan	But we're brothers. That counts for something, right?
13567	J.D.	Not to me.
13568	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13569	J.D.'s Narration	Whenever there's an argument in my family, it's a time-honored tradition to pretend nothing happened.

13571	J.D.	Chocolate chippity good!
13572	Dan	More whipped cream, Christopher?
13573	Turk	Bring it!Mmm-ghmmmm!
13574	Dan	I just want to say before I hit the road, it's been great hanging with you; and Johnny, I know I don't say this nearly enough, but, umOoh, coffee's kicking in. I'll be back in just under four minutes.

13576	Elliot	Look, Carla, I cannot afford to be suspended right now. I'm gonna have to resort to blackmail.
13577	Carla	How are we gonna blackmail Kelso?
13578	Elliot	No, no, no, no, no! Unless you take the fall for both of us, I'm telling Turk you're sleeping with someone.

13582	J.D.	Hey, thanks for loaning me this shirt, man. I got a lot of compliments from the sistas. Sharon the security guard even called me a cracka!

13584	J.D.	Turk, you don't get it, man. Your family was there for you.
13585	Turk	You know, I love how kids of divorce really have the market cornered on family dysfunction. But let me share with you a typical Thanksgiving at the Turk household: It starts with my mother yelling at my sister for yelling at my grandmother who's yelling at the television screen, which happens to be the microwave. And then my militant brother Jabari formerly Bob gives my father attitude for using the word "black", even though he's referring to the turkey. Which, by the way, only got burnt because instead of turning the oven off, my bi-polar aunt Leslie tried to shove her head in it.Now check the ball, cracka!
13586	J.D.	One-nothing.

13591	Dr. Kelso	Good afternoon, suspendees, Ted.What a boy!
13592	Lawyer	Sir, about Nurse Espinosa and Dr. Reid's suspensions, really there aren't any grounds to punish them for moonlighting, because they weren't working with people just animals.
13593	Dr. Kelso	"Just animals"? Oh, please, this dog is smarter than most people. He's definitely smarter than _you_.
13594	Lawyer	Sir, I don't think

13614	Dan	No you don't.
13615	J.D.	I know. I have dreams where I staple your fingers to your face.

13618	Dr. Kelso	Why are you here.
13619	Elliot	My boyfriend is in New Zealand for six months, and if I don't moonlight, then I'm never gonna have enough money to see him.
13620	Carla	My wedding's costing twice as much as I thought it would, and I need the extra cash.
13621	Lawyer	Baxter won't get out of my chair.
13622	Carla	Dr. Kelso, even though we're understaffed and underpaid, I've been working here for ten years! I mean, all day long? All I hear is "Carla, Carla, Carla, Carla, Carla, Carla, Carla, Carla, Carla, Carla, Carla, Carla, Carla, Carla, Carla, Carla...Carla...Carla."
13623	Elliot	Sir, what wh what Carla is saying, and not in any kind of crazy or, uh, rambling sort of way, is that we work hard here at the hospital, but it's not the only thing in our lives.
13624	Carla	Surely you must know what it's like to love someone so much that you'd do anything you had to.
13625	Dr. Kelso	I'll see you two in the morning. Now get out of my office before I change my mind.Darling, I wanna say something. For the past 25 years, we've been going through the motions once every couple of weeks we have sex, and then we have breakfast without saying a word. Well, tonight, I want you to put on a nice dress, because I'm gonna take you to dinner and I'm gonna start telling you all the things I haven't taken the time to say all these years. ... I love you, too.
13626	Lawyer	That was...beautiful, sir!
13627	Dr. Kelso	Thanks, Ted. Call my wife, tell her I won't be home tonight.
13628	Dan	Hey, Dr. Cox.
13629	Dr. Cox	Oh, here I'd been told you left. It made me happy.
13630	Dan	Yeah, you don't like me. People don't like me. You know why? I'm a screw-up; always have been. For instance, when we were kids, Mom would always make me walk Johnny to school first day every year. Every year, I'd walk him to the wrong school! Just 'cause!
13631	Dr. Cox	Boy, that's a great story, really. And I'm sure you were just a horrible big brother
13632	Dan	Well...
13633	Dr. Cox	but I'm afraid you have me confused with somebody who gives a crap. And it's okay, you don't need to be embarrassed, turns out it happens all the time. For instance, my father actually made the same mistake on his death bed.
13634	Dan	Hey, listen, Dr. Cox: No offense, I'm a big fan of the tough-guy act, but let me tell you what I really think. I think you love the fact that these kids idolize you. Johnny does! Johnny was always the one in the family we knew was going someplace sweet kid, smart kid. Becoming a doctor, this is all he ever wanted; and yet, somehow, you've found a way to beat that out of him, haven't you? Turned him into some cynical guy who seems to despise what he does.
13635	J.D.'s Narration	Love can give you strength you never knew you had.
13636	Dan	It was good seeing you, Dr. Cox.
13637	Dr. Cox	Good to see you, Dan. All the best.
13638	J.D.'s Narration	Love can also give you courage.
13639	Elliot	Lots of cats today! Heh! What's wrong with this guy?
13640	Carla	I think he's got something stuck behind his big, sharp tooth.
13641	J.D.'s Narration	As for me, it's enough just to love my brother, even though I know he'll never come up big for me.
13642	Dr. Cox	Well, Mr. Pickles, welcome back.
13643	J.D.	Here we go with this guy again.
13644	Dr. Cox	Yep. Still, it sure is nice to be doing something you love. I wouldn't trade it. How 'bout you?
13645	J.D.	No....
13646	Dr. Cox	Don't forget that.
13647	Mr. Bober	Pickles.

13651	Carla	Why is there a pancake in the silverware drawer?
13652	Turk	You mean, why is there silverware in the _pancake drawer_? Wuhuh!!
13653	Carla	Hey, those nuts are for my brother, please don't eat 'em all!
13654	Turk	Baby, why you makin' such a big deal about your brother coming, anyway?
13655	Carla	He's my baby brother! I practically raised him! Now, I want you to try and get along with him this time? If you do, I promise to fulfill that fantasy of yours but not with the weird outfit, and none of those crazy toys.
13656	Turk	So we'd just have normal sex....
13657	Carla	If I'm not sleepy!
13658	Turk	Deal.
13659	J.D.	What's up with you and her brother, anyway? Did something happen at her mother's funeral?
13660	Turk	Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Just so you know, this is a rental and I got the mileage right up here , so no joy-rides, comprende?
13661	Carla	Turk! This is my brother, Marco!
13662	Turk	Sorry for your loss....I mean, who wears a vest to a funeral, anyway, man?
13663	J.D.'s Narration	The amazing thing wasn't that Carla's brother hated Turk...
13664	Carla	¡¡¡Marco!!!

13666	Carla	¡Un abrazo a tu hermana!
13667	J.D.'s Narration	...it was that he was able to keep it up without even speaking the same language.
13668	Carla	Ven, quiero presentarte.
13669	Marco	Okay.
13670	Carla	Este es J.D.
13671	Marco	Oh, hey. Hey.
13672	Carla	Y tú conoces a Turk.
13673	Marco	¿Qué pasa?
13674	Subtitle	What's happening?
13675	Marco	Zangano.
13676	Subtitle	Jackass.
13677	Turk	Dude, you were wearin' a vest! Vesto!
13678	J.D.'s Narration	Still, I had my own problems.Even though she had a boyfriend, I was still crazy about Elliot. And, God bless her, she wasn't making it any easier.
13679	Elliot	Hey.
13680	J.D.	What are you doing?
13681	Elliot	All the beds are taken. Scoot.
13682	J.D.	Bunk with The Todd!
13683	Elliot	J.D., you know that he is a sleep humper.
13684	Todd	Sometimes when I'm banging this mattress, I'm thinking about banging that one!
13685	Elliot	Hello? ... Sean!? Where are you? ... The west coast of New Zealand? I'm in the on-call room! ... Hey, J.D.'s here!J.D., say hi!
13686	J.D.	Oh, hey Sean.
13687	Elliot	Uh!?
13688	J.D.	Oh! You wanted to keep talking?
13689	J.D.'s Thoughts	How are you supposed to get over someone when you have to be around them all the time?This night could not get any worse.
13690	J.D.	Todd! You're having a dream! Wake up!
13691	Todd	Dude, I _am_ awake.
13692	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13693	Jordan	I'm having second thoughts about our giant nanny. She's lovely and all, but every time the fridge is empty, she looks at our son like he's a plate of ribs.
13694	Dr. Cox	Well, you shoulda let me hire the really skinny model. At least if she ate Jack, she'd throw him up right after.
13695	Jordan	I got board meetings all day, but I'll see you for dinner tonight.Bye, wife
13696	Dr. Cox	Rreowr.
13697	Elliot	Doug! Doug!
13698	Doug	I don't wanna be a doctor!
13699	Doctors	Awww.
13700	Dr. Cox	Fine. I'm gonna go ahead and tell you how it ends: Dr. Phil says, "And how...is that working out...for you?" And the big fat lady cries, "Wah."
13701	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13702	Elliot	Hm!
13703	Dr. Cox	It's all about the four dollars, trust me. And seeing as my money is contingent on you lemmings actually doing your jobs, I would say that now is a pretty good time for you to scurry on back to work so that I can continue to afford the antidepressants that keep me so damn jolly. GO!!!Say, Angela....
13704	J.D.	Oh, I think he means _me_, Angela.
13705	J.D.'s Thoughts	I wonder what I did now.
13706	Dr. Cox	Lookit, this new gig is a great opportunity for me, and I I want it to go well. And, for some reason, all these other bobble-heads seem to look up to you, so it would make my life one hell of a lot easier if you got in line behind me.
13707	J.D.	No problem.
13708	J.D.'s Thoughts	I guess people can surprise you.
13709	Danni	We'd still die.
13710	J.D.	We'd still what?
13711	Danni	If the elevator cable snapped, even if we timed it out perfectly and jumped up right before impact, we'd still be crushed to death. I wish I'd taken the stairs.
13712	J.D.	Me too.
13713	Danni	Sorry, sometimes I just have this inner monologue running through my head.
13714	J.D.'s Thoughts	Inner monologue? Weirdo!
13715	J.D.	That's my floor.
13716	Danni	Lucky bastard.
13717	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13718	Marco	Mira, el cabezón brillante se hace como "no está mirando". Dirme algo, yo me río, para que se crea que nos burlamos de él.  Subtitle: Look, Mr. Shiny Head over there is pretending not to watch us.
13719	Carla	Marco, yo ne le voy hacer eso.
13720	Subtitle	Marco, I'm not going to do that.
13721	Carla	¡Ya!
13722	Subtitle	That's enough.
13723	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13724	Elliot	What'd I miss?
13725	Dr. Kelso	It's come to my attention...
13726	J.D.	Something's come to his attention.
13727	Dr. Kelso	...that some family members of our critically ill patients have been complaining because of the relatively small amount of time you all spend with their loved ones. 'Course, in Dr. Murphy's case that's probably a good thing.
13728	Doug	Sir, if I could just take this chance to explain my disturbingly high mortality rate?
13729	Dr. Kelso	Why don't I do that for you? You're a bad doctor.
13730	J.D.'s Narration	Unfortunately, our new residency director felt a little differently.
13731	Dr. Cox	Dead. Dead. Dead. Dead. And, oh my goodness, if we don't have somebody here that we might be able to help. Miss Bartow is thirty-six, she is septic, and she is in respiratory failure. Dr. Weiss, I want you to draw three sets of surveillance cultures. Mr. Murphy
13732	Doug	_Dr._ Murphy?
13733	Dr. Cox	...Just go ahead and get a steady BG.
13734	J.D.	I say we listen to Dr. Cox, and do exactly what he says.
13735	Dr. Cox	That's unbelievable.
13736	Elliot	But, Dr. Cox, earlier today Dr. Kelso was telling us that he wants
13737	Dr. Cox	Ugssshhhhh. I don't ever want to hear anything that's come out of that man's mouth; unless, of course, it's "Oh, my God! I'm dying. Now I'm moving towards the light. But wait a minute, there's been a mistake! This is Hell! Hello, Hitler. Hello, Mussolini. Captain Kangaroo? _That's_ weird!"
13738	Elliot	Dolphin _trainer_ sex. My boyfriend is a dolphin trainer.
13739	Dr. Cox	Here that's a shame, because the whole dolphin thing used to make you so interesting. Too bad.
13740	J.D.	You heard him, people! We're moving on!
13741	Dr. Cox	Oh, God help me.
13742	J.D.	...God help him!
13743	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13744	J.D.'s Thoughts	My _God_, is there a sexier woman in the world?
13745	Elliot	Mm. I gotta go my chin hair is back.
13746	J.D.'s Thoughts	Ohhhh, I wish she'd cut it off and give it to me.
13747	J.D.	Oh, GOD!
13748	Danni	I don't mind it at the movies, sitting alone. But eating alone is sad and pathetic.
13749	J.D.	Are you stalking me?
13750	Danni	Nooo. My sister just had a baby, so I'm doing the whole aunt thing.
13751	J.D.	So, is there any chance of you guys getting back together?
13752	Danni	Well, he's engaged, and he's getting married in two weeks...but, yeah, I think so.Unrequited love sucks, you know.
13753	J.D.	Yeah, it does. You know what we need to do? Uhh...?
13754	Danni	Danni.
13755	J.D.	J.D.
13756	Danni	Hi!
13757	J.D.	Hi. Danni, we need to move on, okay? No more thinking about our exes; no more waiting for the phone to ring; no more stealing her purse just so you can return it later in the hopes that she'll be so grateful, she'll use the money recovered to buy you a drink and _maybe_ have sex with you after.
13758	Danni	Did that work?
13759	J.D.	I stole the wrong purse. ...And, yes!

13761	Marco	Ahh, Senor Blinky.
13762	Subtitle	Ahh, Mr. Blinky.
13763	Carla	¿Te acueldas? Subtitle: Do you remember that?
13764	Marco	Sí.
13765	Carla	Oh, hey Turk, why don't you play the next game with Marco?
13766	Turk	Baby, I I hate PacMan.
13767	Carla	Really? Because you have bed-sheets that indicate otherwise.
13768	Turk	Fine, ask him.
13769	Carla	Marco, ¿por qué no juegas el próximo juego con Turk?
13770	Subtitle	Marco, can Turk play the next game with you?
13771	Marco	No quiero ser "panita" con tu novio estúpido, ¡cabeza de melón!
13772	Subtitle	I don't want to be friends with your stupid, melon-headed boyfriend.
13773	Turk	Baby, I don't understand why he just doesn't learn English.
13774	Marco	Ahh, que se queja que no hablo inglés. Él que no se molesta aprender español..¡para la mujer que dice que ama!
13775	Subtitle	I bet he's whining about how I don't speak English even though he's never bothered to learn Spanish.
13776	Carla	Él está aprendiendo, ¿ok? Dice que "sí", dice que "no", dice "queso".
13777	Subtitle	He's trying to learn. He's already got 'yes', 'no', and 'cheese'.
13778	Turk	Hey! Somebody say something about cheese? 'Cause if you gonna make a cheese run, holla at me, dawg!
13779	Carla	Baby, when we left the Dominican Republic, Marco never wanted to learn English. He even went to boarding school in Puerto Rico. Imagine what it's like to constantly feel like an outsider just because you're proud of your heritage.
13780	Turk	But did you or did you not say something about cheese?

13782	Marco	¡¡¡Ahh, coño!!!   God, darn you!
13783	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13784	Dr. Cox	Miss Bartow's systemic vascular resistance is falling, so the next couple hours are gonna be crucial, okay?
13785	Dr. Kelso	Perry, the fact that these residents are spending most of their time buzzing around that one patient makes me think that you told them to disobey a direct order from me.
13786	Dr. Cox	Bob Kelso, that's just not true. Here, I told them to disregard _all_ direct orders from you.
13787	Dr. Kelso	I know you all think of me as some heartless monster; still, if your grandmother were here, wouldn't you want her doctor to spend as much time with her as he does with anyone else?
13788	J.D.	Grandma Dorian or Nana Hobbs? Because Nana Hobbs can be an eensy bit racist.
13789	Dr. Kelso	Grandma Dorian.
13790	J.D.	She's dead.
13791	Dr. Kelso	The point is, sometimes what's best for this hospital _is_ what's best for the patients! I know it, you know it, and guess what, Dr. Cox knows it, too. Although damned if he doesn't disagree with me just because I said it.
13792	J.D.	Sir, I don't think that's true.
13793	Dr. Kelso	Perry! It's hotter than hell in here!
13794	Dr. Cox	Freezing!
13795	Dr. Kelso	Great coffee, though!
13796	Dr. Cox	Rat piss!
13797	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Murphy is an incompetent suck-up.
13798	Dr. Cox	No, Bob. In fact, he's one of the finest young doctors I've ever had the good fortune of working with.
13799	Dr. Kelso	Your witness.
13800	J.D.	What are you doing?
13801	Doug	I'm calling my dad!!!

13803	Danni	Hey!
13804	J.D.	Oh! Hey, how are you?
13805	Danni	Good. So, I did it I talked to my ex.
13806	J.D.	And...?
13807	Danni	And I said, "Congratulations on the wedding, and I hope you two stay happy, and, by the way, size does matter."
13808	J.D.	See! That's what happens when you finally have the courage to cut the cord! Before you know it, you'll be ready for someone new to come along.
13809	Danni	Hey, you wanna go grab a cup of coffee?
13810	J.D.	Ooh, I can't. I got something really important to do.
13811	Elliot	Thanks, J.D. I am so tense. Someone stole my purse!
13812	J.D.	It'll turn up....
13813	J.D.'s Narration	Once the dynamic of a relationship is established, it rarely changes.
13814	Turk	¿Queso?
13815	Subtitle	Cheese?
13816	Marco	Hombre, ¡tú me tienes harto!
13817	Subtitle	Man, I am so sick of you.
13818	Turk	I'm sorry, but I...can't...understand...you!
13819	Marco	Yeah? Well, that talking slower and louder thing is not as helpful as you might think.
13820	Janitor	Ni empieces.
13821	Subtitle	Don't get me started.
13822	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, if the dynamic does change, it's never as simple as you'd hope.
13823	Dr. Cox	Hey, Newbie, listen, I got dinner plans with Jordan, and seeing as you're on-call, whatta you say you pull up a chair, here, in front of Miss Bartow?
13824	J.D.'s Narration	...Especially when it involves someone who's used to you following their lead.
13825	J.D.	Look, Dr. Cox, I'll take care of her, and I'll have my interns help, but you gotta know I have other patients, too, so....
13826	Dr. Cox	Maybe you didn't understand me, there, Violet. I don't want you leaving her side, even if someone thinks they saw Justin Timberlake downstairs. Now, dammit all, are you falling in line with me or not?
13827	J.D.	I don't think so.
13828	Dr. Cox	Okay, then.
13829	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13830	J.D.'s Narration	It was a strange feeling not doing what Dr. Cox wanted me to do. Still, I knew I was right.
13831	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, God, if Jordan knew I was the reason Dr. Cox canceled dinner tonight, she'd give me the stink-eye and then twist my nurples off.Calm down, tiger. She doesn't know.She knows! She knows!

13837	Carla	Who?
13838	Turk	Your brother; he speaks English. Yo, tell her you speak English!
13839	Marco	¿Qué?
13840	Subtitle	What?
13841	Turk	Don't "que" my "Que," my ass! "Que," my ass!You were there, and you saw the whole thing. Now you tell her!
13842	Janitor	I don't know what you're talking about.

13849	Elliot	Well, you know the picture of us at the beach, where I actually look good and you think that you look like Bjork?
13850	J.D.	Yeah.
13851	Elliot	Well, I was hoping you wouldn't mind if I cut you out of it, and used it in a collage that I'm making for Sean?
13852	J.D.	No problem!
13853	Elliot	Thanks!
13854	J.D.	Whoa.
13855	Danni	How's the whole moving on thing going?
13856	J.D.	It's going great, Danni! In opposite world!
13857	Danni	Well, I just wanted to say goodbye. I was gonna stick around for a few more days, but I don't really feel like that there's a reason to. ...Is there?
13858	J.D.	Probably not.
13859	Danni	I'm gonna miss you.
13860	J.D.	I'm gonna miss you, too.
13861	Danni	Dude, we just met I was kidding.
13862	J.D.	Oh! That was good! No! No, I was doing the same thing!

13866	Dr. Cox	Hey, Barbie. How's about you sashay on over here, push those rock & roll bangs out of your face, and keep those peepers on Miss Bartow's hemodynamics!
13867	Elliot	Oh, first I've gotta discharge Mr. Hale, then get a _____ on Mrs. Peterson, and then, to be perfectly frank, perform a thong extrication on Ms. Reid.
13868	Doug	Hey, _your_ last name is Reid!
13869	Elliot	Doug. I have underwear in my butt. After that, though, I'll totally swing back by here.
13870	Dr. Kelso	You're losing them! Oh, don't get me wrong, you had me worried there was gonna be a bunch of young Dr. Coxes roaming the halls, calling me "Bobbo", shaving my genitals when I pass out at the Christmas party....
13871	Dr. Cox	Tradition is tradition, Bob.
13872	Dr. Kelso	Yeah.... Then I remembered that you've been here over ten years, and there's not a single disciple of yours to be found. And you know why?
13873	Dr. Cox	You told 'em this exact same story and bored 'em to death?
13874	Dr. Kelso	No. It's because eventually they all start questioning the gospel according to Cox, and you can't handle that. Can you?
13875	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13876	Marco	Hey, jackass.
13877	Turk	Hello, Marc. I'm guessing Carla's not around.
13878	Marco	She's in the bathroom, Cepillándose los dientes.  Subtitle: Brushing her teeth.
13879	Turk	Hey, baby. Gimme some of that minty breath.
13880	Carla	Noooooo, not in front of my brother that stuff always makes him uncomfortable.
13881	Turk	Oh, really? I just wanted to apologize for the way I've been acting by loving you up and down, and all around!
13882	Carla	Turk!
13883	Turk	Baby, he can't understand you! Now let's go put some more of your footprints on the ceiling!
13884	Marco	That's it, you son of a bitch!!!
13885	Turk	I told ya!
13886	J.D.	So black people can get black eyes, too, huh? Who knew?
13887	Turk	I haven't had one this bad since your Nana Hobbs threw that rock at me.
13888	J.D.	She thought you were robbing the house.
13889	Elliot	J.D.! Did you hear, Miss Bartow's completely stabilized!
13890	Dr. Cox	I don't wanna see you around here anymore, okay?All right, come on you guys, you all got work to do!
13891	J.D.	Here it comes. I'm incompetent. I'm a girl. I'm a little girl. I'm a little girl with pigtails that rides a tricycle.
13892	Dr. Cox	No. Well...yes, but I am honestly trying to tell you that I don't think I was being clear with you before. In fact, I think I was being a pretty lousy teacher. Look, I think putting one in the "win" column every now and then is what gives us the juice to keep plugging along in games that we know deep down we're not gonna win. And that's why I locked in so intensely to that patient. Because opportunities, they...God, they come along so rarely in this place. And when they do, you just can't let them slip through your fingers. You cannot. You know?
13893	J.D.	I think I do.
13894	J.D.'s Narration	I wasn't sure what I was hoping for. ...That somehow Danni had decided not to leave...that she'd snapped her leg in the parking lot....
13895	J.D.	DANNI!?
13896	Guy	Yo.
13897	J.D.'s Narration	...All I knew was I'd missed an opportunity.
13898	Carla	Entonces cuando yo estaba en high school, ¿tú me oíste hablarle a mis amigas de las pastillas anticonceptivas?
13899	Subtitle	So when I was a senior in high school, you heard me talking to my friends in English about going on the pill?
13900	Marco	No, no, aprendí el inglés hace poco.
13901	Subtitle	No, I just learned English a few years ago.
13902	Carla	Qué bueno, porque yo nunca tomé la pastilla. Ni la estoy tomando ahora, porque ni he hecho el sexo. ¡Sería divertiduela!
13903	Subtitle	Well, good, because I wasn't on the pill, and I'm not now. I've never had sex. I hope it's fun.
13904	Carla	¿Por qué no me lo dijiste?
13905	Subtitle	Why didn't you tell me?
13906	Marco	No sé. Mami murió, y ahora tú te casas. Siempre hemos tenido una conexión especial. Supongo que no la quise perder.

13912	Turk	Baby, fo'shizzle-dizzle. Do your thizzle, 'cause I'm up out this pizzle. Chach!
13913	Marco	¿Qué dijo él?
13914	Subtitle	What did he say?
13915	Carla	No tengo la menor idea.
13916	Subtitle	I have no idea.
13917	Carla & Marco	Zangano.
13918	Subtitle	Jackass!
13919	J.D.'s Narration	No one knew her last name, no one even remembered seeing her. I started to wonder if Danni was even real. I guess that's the thing about life. You don't really
13920	Danni	Hey, J.D.
13921	J.D.	Excuse me!
13922	J.D.'s Narration	You don't really get many second chances.
13923	J.D.	Oh! Danni! Hi! I'm sorry, sometimes I have this inner monologue running through my head.
13924	Danni	Oh.
13925	Danni's Thoughts	Weirdo!
13926	Danni	I'm having dinner with my sister tonight, but I swear I'm leaving after that.
13927	J.D.	Don't. Stay here with me, we'll get that cup of coffee.
13928	Danni	I'm not gonna stick around for one cup of coffee.
13929	J.D.	Okay, two cups...and some pie.

13936	Danni	J.D., I haven't even had coffee yet.
13937	J.D.	Ah, you're right, I'm sorry."Big Al" for example....
13938	Danni	Why don't you just tell me a story? Something romantic.
13939	J.D.	Okay. Once there was a beautiful girl who met a stunningly handsome young doctor....
13940	J.D.'s Narration	He noticed her right away.And she noticed him noticing her.Their first date was amazing.They had so much fun together, they felt like kids again.Then it was time for their first kiss.
13941	Danni	And...how was that?
13942	J.D.'s Narration	Intense.
13943	J.D.	Whoa! Woo! Agh!
13944	J.D.'s Narration	The next date didn't start that well, either......but it got better from there.And that night, well...
13945	J.D.	...it was the most amazing night the young doctor ever had.
13946	Danni	And then what happened?
13947	J.D.	And then the young doctor realized he hadn't seen the beautiful girl naked in the light yet.Damn!
13948	Danni	Are you as into this as I am?
13949	J.D.	If I wasn't crazy about ya, would I be willing to do this?Doom-doom, bah, do-doom-doom, dop-bop...
13950	J.D.'s Narration	As I was doing the Naked Chicken Dance that my uncle Bart had taught me, I realized that life couldn't get much better than this.
13951	J.D.	...doom-doom, dop-dop, doom
13952	Dr. Cox	Okay! Now, just because Jordan thinks it's cute that you're violating her little sister doesn't mean that you can use my guest-room for your nerdy, G-rated sexcapades.
13953	J.D.	My bad.It's a beautiful shot of you.
13954	Dr. Cox	Jus Come'ere!Ju you filthy, filthy boy! Filthy girl! Filthy girl!

13958	J.D.'s Narration	Even though Dr. Cox got a front-row look at Little Buddy ohhh, no! Now I'm saying it! my day still started off great!
13959	Dr. Cox	I'm about to set a new distance record for projectile vomiting.
13960	Jordan	Come on.... It reminds me of my sexiest kiss: Our honeymoon, standing waist-deep in the ocean.... I think you were in at the bar.
13961	Dr. Cox	Okay! Gotta go! Come on.
13962	Danni	Be brilliant today!
13963	J.D.	I always am.Ah! Ow!You know, I hit my head so hard I actually saw cartoon birds. Then I realized I was in Pediatrics and it was just the wallpaper! Ha!
13964	Dr. Cox	Stunning. Look, Tammy, as far as your love life goes, normally I couldn't care less who's laying your quivering body down by the fire while your lips whisper "No, no...no" but your eyes scream, "Yes. Yes. Oh, big daddy, yes!" But when you're dating Jordan's sissy-poo, it forces me to spend time with you outside of the hospital, and I just won't have that. So, hhhere's the deal: Don't want to have dinner with you. Don't want to go bowling with you. And I never, ever again want to walk into my kitchen and hear you say, "Ohh, it's waffle time! It's waffle time! Won't you have some waffles of mine?"
13965	J.D.	"...waffles of mine..."
13966	Dr. Cox	Bottom line: We'll be bestest friends foreverest if you just keep your face out of my face. Uh-huh.Awwww.
13967	J.D.	She's my patient!
13968	Jill	Hey guys, how are you? I'm great! You know me, I'm up, up, up, up, up, and then some fashion nazi on the E! Network says that pear-shaped people shouldn't wear stripes, and whoosh, guess who's ear-deep in mint-chocolate chip ice cream. Meheehee.
13969	J.D.	You know, if you leave it on the counter for an hour, you can just drink it like a milkshake. Except, watch out if that block's not totally melted, hits you in the face!
13970	Jill	Oh, that'd go everywhere.
13971	J.D.	Yeah, one time I got Chunky Monkey in my eye.
13972	Dr. Cox	What brings Ms. Tracy to us?
13973	J.D.	Oh, uh, her landlord found her passed out on her floor.
13974	Jill	Yeah, lucky me, I couldn't pay my rent this month.
13975	J.D.'s Narration	A recent study found that doctors spend an average of fifteen seconds listening to a patient.It sounds insensitive, but the truth is it's all the time you need.
13976	Dr. Cox	So, how you feel?
13977	Jill	Awesome!
13978	Dr. Cox	Ms. Tracy...
13979	Jill	Headachy, nauseous, and embarrassed that my landlord saw me in my granny panties.
13980	Dr. Cox	Oh, dear. We're gonna run some tests and figure this out.
13981	Jill	I'll be here! ...If you....

13983	Guy	Ow!
13984	Elliot	Sorry! I if that gets infected, I'm a doctor!
13985	Carla	Look, you keep going to the right, so this time aim at that guy to the left, and you'll hit the board.
13986	J.D.	Those two are like best friends now, huh?
13987	Turk	I know. I wonder what it was that made them so tight?
13988	Carla	Elliot! What are you doing here?
13989	Elliot	I'm, uh, just meeting some friends here for drinks.
13990	Carla	Yes! Me too! Friends.
13991	Erik Estrada	Hey.
13992	Together	PONCH!!!!
13993	Erik Estrada	Damn. I still got it.
13994	Turk	Wait a second, dude, wa that was us.
13995	J.D.	I know.
13996	Together	Greatest night ever!!!

13998	Dr. Kelso	Yes, Enid, I hear Baxter growling, but the fact is you ventured into his side of the house. ... Baring his teeth, huh? ... Okay, now here's what you do. ... Are you ready? ... Make a sudden move!Ahhh, those two!
13999	Lawyer	Sir, we've got some complaints that the new discount stethoscopes you ordered are uncomfortably tight. I contacted the manufacturer, but apparently he's decided to focus more on his hand-made smoking paraphernalia.
14000	Dr. Kelso	Nonsense! These are fine!
14001	Lawyer	Are you okay Dr. Kelso?
14002	Dr. Kelso's Thoughts	Sweet dancing Jehovah! I've punctured my brain!
14003	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14004	Dr. Cox	Boy, oh boy, that's some rock. When, uh, when's the big day?
14005	Jill	Oh, me? No, no, never my fiancé dumped me. I'm just noticing how beautiful his mother's ring is. You know, compared to the fake one I sent back to him. Oops!
14006	J.D.	Ms. Tracy, we found some organophosphates in your system. Have you had any recent exposure to pesticides?
14007	Jill	Pesticides? No, I don't have any pest problems.
14008	Dr. Cox	Oh, God, that must be so nice!
14009	J.D.	They're just feelings; they'll heal.
14010	Dr. Cox	Don't worry. We're on top of this.
14011	Jill	Oh ...Bye.
14012	Danni	Hey!
14013	Dr. Cox	Hey...hey.
14014	Danni	Jordan just said we should all go to the carnival tonight.
14015	J.D.	The carnival!?Oh, I can't go to the carnival, Danni. I puke at carnivals...a lot.
14016	Danni	You don't really puke at carnivals, do you.
14017	J.D.	I do. But I still love 'em!
14018	Dr. Cox	Look, I have an even dandier idea: Why don't you crazy kids do something on your own?
14019	Danni	Look, Perry, the fact is I'm Jordan's sister, so as long as I'm staying in town you're gonna be seeing a lot of these smiling faces. Smile.

14021	Elliot	So, I waxed my legs at home last night.
14022	Carla	Yeah, how did that go?
14023	Elliot	Not great, I can't do it.I'd rather die hairy.Oh, Mrs. Cainings needs something to help her sleep. Give her Haloperidol.
14024	Carla	Haloperidol won't put her to sleep. Give her a Benzo, it'll knock her right out.
14025	Elliot	Yeah, but, sometimes with Benzos older people can have a bad reaction.
14026	Carla	Elliot, have I ever steered you wrong?
14027	Elliot	Who suggested this?Ohhhh! ...Smooth!
14028	Carla	Benzo it is.
14029	Elliot	Hey, wait! What about this one?
14030	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14031	Todd	Dude, my broccoli is hot.
14032	Turk	Please tell me you mean temperature-wise because there is no way you can find broccoli sexy.
14033	Todd	Oh...yeah...temperature-wise.......And mini green boobs-wise! What's up!!
14034	Turk	Sir, I wanted to talk to you about that hernia seminar this weekend?Okay, sure, we can totally talk later!
14035	Janitor	Hey, Dr. Kelso. Hey. Dr. Kelso. Uh, I don't know if you heard or not, but Bernice, the lady who does the PA announcements usually, she just got hit by a bus, and, um, I was on the speech team in high school......so, anyway, I was thinking that maybe from now on, I could do the announcements. You know, just until Bernice gets back on her...foot.
14036	Dr. Kelso	Splendid!
14037	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14038	J.D.'s Thoughts	Dr. Cox seems to be having fun...but I think I know why.
14039	Dr. Cox	Ohh, ooh! Whack a newbie! Whack a newbie! Whack a newbie! Ohh! Ohhh!
14040	Newbie Heads	Missed me! Ha! Ha!
14041	Dr. Cox	Whack a newbie! Ohh, there you are! Ohh, there you are! Oh, come here! Ohh!
14042	Newbie Heads	Oww! Oww!! Owww!
14043	Dr. Cox	Ohhhhhhhh, whack a newbie!!! Whack a
14044	Jordan	Perry.It's over.
14045	Dr. Cox	Sorry.
14046	Jordan	So, we're gonna go eat some more disgusting fried food and then look at the fat lady to make ourselves feel better.
14047	Danni	So, we'll meet you guys on the Ferris wheel.Only if your stomach's okay.
14048	J.D.	Oh, yeah, it's only the back-and-forthy rides that get me.
14049	Dr. Cox	Well, you have done it. It's Friday night, and instead of being at home, drinking whiskey through my son's sippy cup, I'm actually at a carnival with you, surrounded by piles of manure even though I've yet to see a single animal!
14050	J.D.	That __is__ weird....
14051	Dr. Cox	Uh-huh. I'll tell you what, how 'bout we head right on over there, and if you can raise that hammer above your head with those chicken bones you call arms, I'll let you take a free whack at my dome.
14052	J.D.	First of all, I already raised the hammer; and the only reason I didn't ring the bell is that the game is obviously rigged.
14053	Kid	Woo-hoo!
14054	Dad	Good job, son!
14055	Dr. Cox	Uh-huh.
14056	J.D.	Look, the only positive thing about this whole situation is that it's driving you crazy and there's nothing you can do about it.
14057	Kid	Way to go, Gina!
14058	J.D.	Oh, come on!
14059	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14060	Janitor	Dr. Tushy, you're needed in the OR.Nice name, buddy. Beat up in high school much?
14061	Carla	Oh It's okay. It's okay. It's okay!
14062	Elliot	What's going on!?!
14063	Carla	She's having a reaction to the Benzo.
14064	J.D.'s Narration	There are a lot of different ways to get the upper hand in a relationship.
14065	J.D.	Oh, I gave the guy half a corn-dog so we can all ride foursies!
14066	Dr. Cox	Ohhhhhhohhhhh.
14067	Jordan	Oh, let's go.
14068	Carnie	Corn-dog!
14069	J.D.'s Narration	It can happen with a simple request...
14070	Dr. Kelso	COULD YOU TAKE A LOOK AT MY EARS?
14071	J.D.'s Narration	...it can happen because of a mistake...
14072	Elliot	Mrs. Cainings is stabilized, so DC the posey vest.
14073	Carla	That's never happened to me before with the Benzo. I still think
14074	Elliot	What do you think, Carla? Did you think that maybe I'm the doctor? 'Cause that's what I think. So maybe you should just DC the vest like I asked, and keep your opinion to yourself.
14075	J.D.'s Narration	Still, even when you have the upper hand, it's important to be careful. Because some people fight dirty.
14076	Dr. Cox	You know, Danni, I think it's amazing that you're actually comfortable dating J.D., what with him having nailed Jordan and all.
14077	Carnie	Uh, sorry, folks. A little problem here. Get you down in about an hour or so.
14078	J.D.	I don't feel so good.
14079	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14080	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes the best thing to do is just to say exactly what's in your heart.
14081	J.D.	I'm sorry I puked on your shoes.
14082	Danni	I'm sorry I wore sandals.
14083	J.D.	And, Danni, that whole thing with Jordan......it's so long ago, I don't even remember it.
14084	Danni	J.D., you keep a sex journal of all your experiences under your bed.
14085	J.D.	Gotta stop showing that to new girlfriends!
14086	Danni	Look, you shoulda told me. But I'm not gonna let things like this mess it up with the guy I'm falling in love with.
14087	J.D.	Oh, thank God! Do you wanna get some pineapple pizza?
14088	Danni	I think I'll probably just go inside and wash my feet.
14089	J.D.	That's robot for "Goodnight.""Peace!" Heh.
14090	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14091	Turk	All right, people, listen up: Dr. Kelso has ruptured both his eardrums. You could say whatever you want to him as long as you got a smile on your face! HOLLA!
14092	Dr. Cox	Bob! You stupid motherf .
14093	Dr. Kelso	Thanks for the kind words, gang!
14094	Carla	Yes?
14095	Elliot	Carla, look, I just wanted to apologize.
14096	Carla	I'm so glad! I didn't want us to stay mad at each other!
14097	Elliot	It's all my fault! I should never have listened to you in the first place. I mean, I need to be a strong enough doctor to just ignore you when you won't shut up.
14098	Carla	That's so sweet.
14099	Janitor	All available medical personnel, please report to the second floor for a cat fight. Cat fight on the second floor!
14100	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14101	Dr. Cox	Well, we sent some haz-mat guys over to your apartment, but they said there were no signs of pesticides.
14102	J.D.	They also said you mixed art deco with Indonesian antiques. I think that is so daring!
14103	Jill	Aww.
14104	Dr. Cox	Reel it in, Queer Eye.
14105	Jill	Thanks, guys. Honestly, I can't remember the last time anyone was this nice to me.
14106	J.D.	Well, you know....We gotta go.Hey, you should know your little cheap shot didn't land, because Danni isn't mad at me at all.Hey, Baby! You comin' to give pop-pop some candy? 'Cause I'm hungry!Oh okay, later's fine too.
14107	Dr. Cox	Oh, yeah. I mean, I can I can feel the love all over!
14108	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14109	Carla	Can you believe that Elliot, giving me all that attitude?
14110	Turk	You know, two weeks ago an O.R. nurse with like twenty years experience started telling me I was tying the wrong suture.
14111	Carla	But I bet you listened to her, right?
14112	Turk	Nah, I kicked her ass out the O.R.! Heh!
14113	Carla	But I bet you were nice about it? Right?
14114	Turk	No, I made her cry. The point is, baby, whatever happens with this patient, it's on my shoulders; and it's the same with Elliot and you know that. That's what makes your relationship so complicated. Outside this hospital, yeah, you're the boss of Elliot...and...well, you know...you're the boss of me and...baby, you're the boss of everyone but in this building, Elliot's in charge.
14115	Carla	Am I really the boss of everybody outside of here?
14116	Turk	Baby, you the boss of everybody in the world.Okay.
14117	Janitor	Dr. Dorian, Dr. Turk is free for his rectal exam. He said you'd know what that means.
14118	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14119	J.D.'s Narration	Dear Dr. Cox, I think it's important that you know how much I care for Danni, and how hurt I was by your attempt to sabotage our relationship.
14120	Dr. Cox	Oh, de-de-de isn't it enough that I'm reading it!?
14121	J.D.	Oh, I'm sorry.
14122	Jill	Always fun to be in the bathroom listening to people talk so clearly, you're sure they just heard you pee. You did, didn't you.
14123	J.D.	You start and stop a lot.
14124	Dr. Cox	Lovely. Here.Uh, actually there's great news, uh, Ms. Tracy: We're sending you home. Although, I sure wish we could have figured out how that stuff got introduced into your system to begin with. But sometimes in medicine you have to just chalk it up to life's great mysteries, like crop circles or this gal's Adam's apple.
14125	J.D.	I'm a girl, that's original.
14126	Jill	Hey, you guys, I just want to say, if I don't see you again, thanks and take care.
14127	Dr. Cox	You be well, darlin'.I'll see you next time.
14128	J.D.	Wanna hear a great letter?
14129	Jill	No.
14130	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14131	J.D.	Hey, everybody. This place has dynamite lamb.
14132	Danni	What are you doing here?
14133	Dr. Cox	I called him. Lookit, after shooting my mouth off the other night I've been feeling a lot of...well....
14134	Jordan	Guilt.
14135	Dr. Cox	No. Not that.
14136	J.D.	Guilt?
14137	Dr. Cox	Yes, that.
14138	Jordan	Ugh.
14139	Dr. Cox	I...I don't like her to be right.
14140	J.D.	Look, Danni, I know you're upset about your sister and I
14141	Danni	J.D., if I didn't go out with the guys my sister slept with, I wouldn't have even had a date to the prom.
14142	J.D.	Then what is it?
14143	Danni	Last night I told you I was falling in love with you. And you know what you said?
14144	J.D.	"Thank you"?
14145	Danni	You asked me if I wanted to go get pizza.
14146	J.D.	No.... _Pineapple_ pizza.
14147	Jordan	Sweetie, you can't take this personally. He's a doctor they don't listen to anyone.
14148	Dr. Cox	Please don't lump us all together with numb-nuts over here.
14149	Jordan	Oh, really? This morning I asked you to do me a favor involving my mother. What was it?
14150	Dr. Cox	Well...I can only hope that it had something to do with hiring people to kill her?
14151	Jordan	Oh, come on. You know what? I hope you guys listen better to your patients.
14152	J.D.'s Narration	And for some reason, right then, we both knew how those pesticides had gotten in our patient's system.
14153	Jill	Lucky for me, I couldn't pay my rent this month.
14154	Dr. Cox	Say, that's some rock. When's the big day?
14155	Jill	Oh, me? No, no, never my fiancé dumped me.I honestly can't remember the last time anyone was this nice to me.Hey, you guys, I just want to say, if I don't see you again, thanks and take care.
14156	J.D.	She did it to herself.
14157	Dr. Cox	We gotta go.
14158	J.D.'s Narration	I guess the problem with only listening to a patient for fifteen seconds is, sometimes you don't hear everything...and when you finally realize what they were trying to say, you might've lost them forever.
14159	J.D.	Ms. Tracy.
14160	Jill	Hey, guys!
14161	J.D.	We need to talk.
14162	Jill	About what?
14163	Dr. Cox	How _have_ things been going lately?
14164	Jill	Okay? Why, uhAhhh. Actually it has, uh, been a couple of rough months.
14165	Dr. Cox	Come on, Jill. Come on.
14166	J.D.'s Narration	You can never underestimate the importance of listening.
14167	Janitor	A quick note for all my comatose listeners out there: all your lovers have moved on. But, if it's any consolation, my sources tell me they're happy. Well, snooze, you lose. In other news
14168	Dr. Kelso	Get off that thing.
14169	J.D.'s Narration	Listening can effect your career.
14170	Lawyer	There you are, you deaf bastard! I hate you so much, every time you utter my name, I wanna stick my fist all the way down your throat and watch you slowly choke on it!
14171	Dr. Kelso	Ted, I can hear now.
14172	Lawyer	Who's Ted?
14173	J.D.'s Narration	Listening can even mend a friendship.
14174	Elliot	Carla, could you go get You know what, forget it.
14175	Carla	No, doctor, just tell me what you need. I'll do it.
14176	Elliot	Just give him one gram of Ancef for prophylaxis.
14177	J.D.'s Narration	Ultimately, it keeps you in the moment...so you don't miss the things that really matter.
14178	J.D.	So say it again.
14179	Danni	No, you have to earn it.
14180	J.D.	I'll try.
14181	Dr. Cox	Oh, for God's sake, we're watching a movie here.
14182	Jordan	Shh!
14183	Dr. Cox	Kill me.
14184	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14185	J.D.'s Narration	Relationships can be defined by how long people have been together.
14186	J.D.	I am so late, I don't even have time to eat.
14187	J.D.'s Narration	Whether you've been together for a few weeks...
14188	Danni	Do you wanna have sex?
14189	J.D.	Yes.
14190	J.D.'s Narration	...or together for three years.
14191	Carla	Baby?
14192	Turk	Hm?
14193	Carla	What do you think about getting pregnant right after the wedding?
14194	Turk	See ya!
14195	J.D.	Carla! You can't ask a guy that while he's driving!
14196	Carla	My bad.
14197	J.D.	Yes, it was your bad, Carla.
14198	J.D.'s Narration	...Or whether you've been together for more than five years.
14199	Dr. Cox	Why don't we ever have sex?
14200	Jordan	I find it a little hard to feel sexy seeing as I passed a human being out of my body six months ago.
14201	Dr. Cox	Hey, lookit, I had front seats to that bloodbath, and it hasn't affected my sex drive.
14202	Jordan	Oh, no, no, no, no, I got that when you asked the lactation nurse if she needed help getting things started!
14203	Dr. Cox	Right.
14204	Jordan	You know, Perry, a lot of men would be happy just to have a baby.
14205	Turk	So, you're currently on the pill, right?
14206	Carla	Yes! Will you please, just drop it!
14207	Turk	Okay. 'Cause, you know, you've gotta take it the same time every day.Right.
14208	Elliot	When I was in high school, I went to Europe for a month and I forgot to take my birth control pills, so I took like thirty the day I got home.
14209	J.D.	What happened?
14210	Elliot's Mom	Elliot! Your homecoming date is here!
14211	Elliot	Uh.... Stall him!!!Nothing.
14212	Janitor	Oh, Todd, you simply must sample one of these tea buns my mum sent over from Sussex.
14213	Todd	Up high two times. One's for "buns", one's for the "sex" part of Sussex! Come on!
14214	Janitor	Whoa, an American high-five!How perfectly vulgar.
14215	Todd	Yeah.
14216	J.D.	I think the Janitor's pretending to be British.
14217	Doug	You mean Klaus, the German guy?
14218	Janitor	Guten Tag, Doug.
14219	Doug	Thanks!
14220	Janitor	That means "nice haircut."
14221	J.D.	No it doesn't!
14222	Janitor	Mind your own beeswax.
14223	J.D.'s Narration	I guess around here, you have to be prepared for anything.
14224	J.D.	Mmm, Britishy!
14225	J.D.'s Narration	...Especially if you're dealing with a patient who needs emergency surgery.
14226	Turk	Uh, where's Dr. Wen? This patient's ready to go.
14227	Staffer	He just called. He got in a car accident, so he can't make it.
14228	Turk	Don't you play with me, intercom lady! I will find you!
14229	Staffer	Relax. Dr. DiStefano is on-call.
14230	Turk	Thank God.We just dodged a bullet because, look, I am nowhere near ready to perform this type of procedure solo. I would have been terrified, you guys would have sensed it, and it would have been a horrible experience for all of us.
14231	Staffer	Dr. DiStefano is stuck in surgery. It's all on you, Dr. Turk.
14232	Turk	Big piece of cake! Who's with me?Come on!!!
14233	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14234	Turk	Oh, yeah!
14235	J.D.'s Narration	The news of Turk's successful surgery had spread quickly. He was the stud of the hospital.
14236	Turk	Who's the black surgeon you know that just repaired an artery like a pro?
14237	Nurses	Turk!
14238	Turk	That's right, baby.
14239	Ladies	Turk!
14240	Turk	Right on.
14241	J.D.	Turk!
14242	Turk	What?
14243	J.D.	Wow. You must be dancing on the wind right now.
14244	Turk	Dude, today I had to sink or swim all on my own; and guess what? A brother swam.
14245	J.D.	That is so fabulous!
14246	Turk	Dr. Wen!I was scared when you didn't show up, but...your car accident turned out to be the best thing that's ever happened to me!
14247	Dr. Wen	My wife broke both her legs.
14248	Turk	Heh. Still.
14249	J.D.	Maybe it's just Buddha's way of telling her to slow down a little, you know?

14252	Carla	Miguel doesn't speak English, baby.

14266	Janitor	Really? I'm one hundred percent not interested!

14268	J.D.	So, I've been asking around, and apparently you're known as one of three people: Nigel, the Brit; Klaus, the dim-witted German yes, I said "dim-witted or a simple, good-natured stutterer named Efrem.
14269	Janitor	Who says this is the real me? Perhaps this is? Or this.
14270	Doug	Hey, Klaus. In your country, how come Hamburg and Frankfurt, they have nothing to do with hamburgers or hot dogs?

14273	Guy	So, what do you do?
14274	Elliot	Oh, I work at a hospital. I'm a resident, which is actually still kind of like a student. Well, not a student as in, like, dorm rooms and pizza runs and crazy, drunken kissing parties which I know for a fact still go on in Radiology but more of a student in the sense that

14276	Guy	Thanks, man.
14277	J.D.	Why didn't you just tell him you were a doctor?
14278	Elliot	I don't know.... I guess I just still don't feel like a doctor, you know? I mean, that whole thing with Turk today really got me thinking. Like, I've ran codes before, but there's always been someone right there ready to bail me out. Like, I've never had that one defining, sink-or-swim moment.
14279	J.D.	Yeah, but I didn't, like, make a big deal out of it.

14286	Dr. Cox	So you're saying your mom made you pancakes this morning, and you didn't even know that it was pancake day in the cafeteria? You get outta here!
14287	Doug	And the craziest thing
14288	Dr. Cox	No, I'm serious, Nervous Guy: Get outta here!
14289	Carla	Why won't you admit you hurt your back?
14290	Dr. Cox	Carla, come on! Back injuries are for 80-year-old guys named Norman who have pants up to here, nose-hairs down to here, and who start every sentence with the very elegant .

14296	J.D.	Harrison Ford, hands down....But you were probably talking to Carla. I'm having such a gay day!
14297	Carla	"Day"?
14298	J.D.	Yeah! It's just this whole janitor thing has thrown me for a loop.
14299	Carla	Danni, we should watch the movie in Turk's room, because he's gonna keep talking about the janitor, even though we begged him not to.
14300	J.D.	I won't, sweetie, trust me.
14301	Danni	Let's go.
14302	J.D.	I just wanna know what kind of freak needs to spend all day pretending to be somebody else!

14306	Elliot	Mr. Moran, I don't want to make any promises, but, uh, your cellulitis is resolving nicely, and I think that you'll be out of the woods soon.
14307	Mr. Moran	So tell me something: How did an old geezer like me end up with the prettiest young doctor in the place?
14308	Elliot	It's actually just a simple rotation system based on when your shift started and the last patient that you've seen
14309	Mr. Moran	Sweetheart, I'm just paying you a compliment.
14310	Elliot	I have to go.Thanks for saying I'm pretty.
14311	Dr. Cox	Mm. Oh, yeah. Oh, hello...sweet...oh, sweet couch.
14312	Jordan	I've been thinking about what you said this morning. And you're right, we have not been having enough sex lately.
14313	Dr. Cox	Turns out yes, yes we have.
14314	Jordan	No, we haven't. And tonight, we're gonna do it the way you always fantasized about.
14315	Dr. Cox	Laying down in a big tub of ice?
14316	Jordan	Standing up, against the wall, you holding me up. What do you say, Romeo?
14317	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes the moment you've been waiting for comes at the most inopportune time.
14318	Dr. Cox	Let's do this!
14319	Jordan	Mmmmm.
14320	Dr. Cox	Arggghhh! Oh, yeah! Ohhhh, yeah!
14321	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes the moment comes when you feel like you've been waiting for it your whole life. You just have to hope that no one beats you in there and steals your thunder.'Cause if they do, well...you're just gonna end up standing in the corner, watching.

14330	Family Member	Yeah.... That's our 'Citizen Kane'.... Anyway, thanks again. You're a real hero.
14331	J.D.	Oh, please, I put my pants on one leg at a time, just like you guys....Except, after I put my pants on, I save your husband's life! Oh, no he didn't!Ohh, Smelliot! What's the happie-haps!

14333	Jordan	Whoa. I was in a sex coma. How'd you sleep?
14334	Dr. Cox	Great!
14335	Jordan	Ohh, and Perry? I know I asked you to be more sensitive when we do it, but I was just hoping you wouldn't curse as much. I mean, to actually cry during sex, what's that about?
14336	Dr. Cox	I guess I just love you so...much...?
14337	J.D.	What is wrong with you? Is this because I called you "Smelliot"? Because I can't believe you haven't heard that before.
14338	Elliot	J.D., I don't care if you call me that.
14339	J.D.	Hey, everybody! She's cool with "Smelliot"!
14340	Todd	Oh, so he can call you "Smelliot" but I'm not allowed to call you "Vagina Face"?
14341	Elliot	Not the same, Todd!
14342	Todd	HMPH!
14343	Elliot	Look, J.D., that was my patient; I was one step behind you, and you knew it. You stole my moment.

14351	Carla	So I should just disregard everything you say when I'm naked?
14352	Turk	You know, that's not actually a bad idea? We can call it The Naked Rule; and it should probably apply retroactively, so, um, you can get yourself to the airport next weekend?
14353	Carla	Fine.
14354	Turk	Gotta love The Naked Rule!
14355	Dr. Cox	Say, Carla...boy, you...you look nice.

I mean, if I had a dollar for every time I got depressed and my dad didn't make me feel better Actually, he _did_ give me a dollar every time I got depressed. By the end of junior high, I already had a hundred and seventy bucks.... And then got mugged and lost it all. But, by the end of that night, of course, I was back up to a dollar.
14369	Mr. Moran	Sweetheart, why don't you tell me what's really upsetting you.
14370	Elliot	Him.

14373	J.D.	Whatevah!
14374	Turk	Okay, think about her right now.Now think about her and Sean together.Now think about her and me together.

14382	Dr. Cox	You know, the other day I found a gray hair in my happy trail.
14383	Carla	Is that the patch of hair that goes from your belly button down to your pe
14384	Dr. Cox	It is, indeed.
14385	Carla	So? You have a gray happy trail! A lot of women find it distinguished.
14386	Dr. Cox	Carla, I have a six-month-old child. I'm gonna be one of those weird old guys who brings my son down to the park, where everybody is like, Hmm, is he the dad? Is he the grand-dad? Is he the grand-dad's grand-dad? And, oh, my God! Why is he pushing a traffic cone on the swing while his five-year-old little boy is in the mud crying? Is is he taunting the little boy? No! He can't even see the little boy! And, now look, he's actually taking the traffic cone, putting it in the mini-van, and driving away while the little boy cries and the traffic cone sits quietly and watches 'Finding Nemo' on DVD.
14387	Carla	Look, for what it's worth, instead of marrying a long time ago, I'm marrying a guy who probably won't be ready to have kids for another ten years! That'll make me like thirty...grghrghrgh.
14388	Dr. Cox	More like forty-rghrghrghrgh.
14389	Carla	But you know what? It's okay. Because I couldn't handle marriage until now. And I knew you when you were younger, and you would have been a horrible dad. Now? We're both ready.

14473	Elliot	Oh, I'm sure you haven't.
14474	Turk	See, it's funny because you've never really satisfied a woman!

14478	Carla	For what?
14479	Delivery Guy	For reading your chicken-scratch handwriting. Who is with me?
14480	Carla	Listen, I run back and forth for 18 hours a day between patients who _might_ die and patients who _will_ die, and if I find time to write an order for bedpans, I write it fast. So you will forgive me if I don't feel like being judged by some guy in his thirties who still wears shorts to work!Now, go ahead and say the only three words I want to hear coming out of your mouth.

14486	Jordan	Oh, I'm living my dream. Have a great day today.
14487	Dr. Cox	You make me want to kill myself and everybody around me! Ohh... Come, Dixie.
14488	J.D.	So, uh, you and Jordan...huh? You wanna talk about it?
14489	Dr. Cox	I do, but not here, because I'll probably just oh...cry...and it's too late! Here I swore I wouldn't do this. Come on, Perry, get it together. Get it together. Get it to you stop it! You stop it! You stop it! You stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Huuuuah!
14490	Randolph	Heyyy fellas, what's the good word?
14491	Dr. Cox	Uh, Mr. Randolph, your PSA number's* gone up quite a bit since your last blood test. Now, this could be from the prostatitis*, we won't know for sure until your biopsy results come back later on this afternoon. But I feel pretty certain that we're gonna find something.
14492	Randolph	Oh for God's sake Catherine, stop making a scene! I'm sorry doctors, but she gets a little emotional.
14493	Dr. Cox	Are you two WASPs?
14494	Randolph	Episcopalian. Why?
14495	Carla	I can't believe you would veto the French Riviera for our honeymoon because of the nude beaches.
14496	Turk	Baby, the whole point of marriage is that I'm the only one who gets to see your candies and whatnot.
14497	Carla	I gotta go. Meet me in the On-Call room in an hour, I have a very sexy surprise for you.
14498	Turk	Oh? Hell yeah.
14499	Carla	This guy's sick.
14500	J.D.	Thanks.
14501	Janitor	You're stupid!
14502	J.D.	See, now you're just embarrassing yourself. Pick someone else to annoy!
14503	Janitor	I don't pick 'em. They pick me!You know, loose debris can get sucked up into the air conditioning vents. And when that happens, I have to spend the entire day crawling around inside the wall, and I don't like that. You know why? 'Cause there's not enough air. I've hallucinated. I spent a day inside that wall thinking I was a mermaid. So here's the thing: you don't throw around loose trash, and I won't have to waste an entire workday granting the wishes of imaginary fisherman. 'Kay?
14504	Turk	Dude, I'm not scared of you. Life's too good. I'm untouchable.
14505	Janitor	That's what I hoped you'd say.
14506	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Murphy, how about you start us off by describing the medical condition of your patient Mr. Eronson here.
14507	Doug	He's got hypertrophic cardiomyopathy* with severe secondary pulmonary hypertension.*
14508	Dr. Kelso	Wrong. He's dead. Another one bites the dust, huh, sport? Next contestant, Dr. Reid.
14509	Elliot	Mr. Murdock was admitted with a COPD exacerbation*; he responded well to antibiotics and bronchial dilators* but he did develop a rash on his, um......private area.
14510	Dr. Kelso	Sorry, on his what?
14511	Elliot	His peepers.
14512	Dr. Kelso	Excuse me?
14513	Elliot	His schwing-schwong.
14514	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Reid, it's bad enough you run out on a patient in the middle of a pelvic exam. But you are a doctor, and you need to be able to say simple clinical words like "penis," or "vagina," or "anal."
14515	Elliot	"Anal" is not a dirty word, sir.
14516	Dr. Kelso	Tell that to my wife.
14517	Dr. Cox	The, uh, the biopsy's back and I'm afraid it's positive for prostate cancer.
14518	Randolph	Rats! Excuse my language, dear. You know what, Catherine, I can see this conversation being riddled with that kind of talk. Perhaps you should wait out in the hallway.
14519	J.D.	Uh, you know sir, I know that it's cancer, but I'm not really worried.
14520	Randolph	Excuse me, am I confusing cancer with some other disease?
14521	Dr. Cox	No you're not. I think what Captain Bedside here
14522	J.D.	Ow!
14523	Dr. Cox	is _trying_ to say is that it hasn't spread to the lymph nodes yet, so it's still quite easily operable.
14524	J.D.	Yes, and there's an opening in surgery tonight, I managed to jam you in. Look, I know this is happening awfully fast, you must have a lot of emotions swirling around, but I want you to know if you have any questions at all, I'm here.
14525	Randolph	Do you know what channel that Queer Guy show is on?
14526	Dr. Cox	It's okay, tell him.
14527	J.D.	Bravo, Tuesdays at 10, 9 central, 8 Mountain.
14528	Dr. Cox	Oh, lookathat, message from Jordan.
14529	J.D.	How's it going?
14530	Dr. Cox	Just great.
14531	Guy	Hey, watch it!
14532	J.D.	Dr. Cox, we've known each other for over two years.... Let me in, okay? Help me help you. Help me help you, help me help you
14533	Dr. Cox	Stop it.
14534	J.D.	-Help me, help you-
14535	Dr. Cox	Fine, Newbie! Let me let me tell you a little story. It starts every day at 5 in the morning which is just about the time that you're setting your hair for work when I am awakened by a sound: Is that a cat being gutted by a fishing knife? Nooo! That's my son. He's hungry and he's got a load in his pants so big that I'm actually considering hiring a stable boy. But, I go ahead and dig in; because I do love the lad and, well gosh, you know me, I'm a giver. And I'm off to the hospital, where my cup runneth over with both quality colleagues, such as yourself, and a proverbial clown-car full of sick people. But, what the hey, my pay is about the same as guys who break rocks with other rocks and I only have to work three or four hundred hours a week, so, so far I'm a pretty happy camper! And then I head back home where I'm greeted by the faint musk of baby vomit in a house that used to smell like, well...nothing! Nothing! Nothing! I-i-in fact it used to smell like nothing at all. And all I want to do before I restart this whole glorious cycle is, you know, maybe lay on the couch and have a beer and watch some SportsCenter and, if I'm not too sweaty from the day's labors, stick my hand right down my pants, buuut apparently that's not in Jordan's definition of "pulling your weight".
14536	J.D.	Well, that's easy! Just tell her about it. Tell her everything you feel.
14537	Dr. Cox	Should I give her every reason to accept that I'm for real?
14538	J.D.	First of all, no one understands relationships like Billy Joel, okay? "Uptown Girl" got me through high school long story for another day. Secondly, you don't want to end up like the Randolphs back there, just not saying a word to each other, do you?You wish _we_ were more like the Randolphs, don't you?
14539	Dr. Cox	God save me, I do. I reeeeally do!
14540	Turk	Rawwh! Come here.
14541	Carla	So, here's your surprise: You know we'll be getting married in six months.... And I just thought it would be so......hot...
14542	Turk	Yeah?
14543	Carla	...if we didn't have sex again until our wedding night.Can you imagine how great that night will be?
14544	Turk	Awww-So great! Um, how about this, though: How about...you stop having sex, but I keep having sex?
14545	Carla	You mean like an affair?
14546	Turk	No! I'll just have sex with you when you're sleeping.
14547	Carla	Turk, how can you not think this idea is so romantic?
14548	Turk	Maybe you got me confused with that little Amish boy you used to date.
14549	Janitor	Untouchable, eh?
14550	Doug	Hey, Dr. Kelso, none of my patients have died today.
14551	Dr. Kelso	Really? Mr. Ferguson's corpse begs to differ.
14552	Doug	Darn it!
14553	Dr. Kelso	Oh, and Dr. Reid, your patient, Mrs. Burke, has developed a urinary infection. Apparently it hurts when she makes wizzie-winkles through her sea-biscuit.
14554	Elliot	You know, it's not my fault that dirty stuff makes me uncomfortable.
14555	J.D.	Oh, who's fault is it?
14556	Elliot's Mom	But more important than anything, more important than never letting yourself get fat, is never let a man put his dirty howdoyoudo into your bajingo.Jorge! I need to see you in the potting shed.
14557	Elliot	She was always yelling at Jorge in that potting shed. But she never fired him. Even after he kidnapped her and took her to Acapulco....
14558	J.D.'s Thoughts	This is a job for Miss Busybody Smartypants!
14559	Carla	I know what you have to do, and I'm gonna help you through this.
14560	Turk	Dude, I'm dying here.
14561	J.D.	Turk, it's been like eighteen hours since you had sex.
14562	Turk	I'm saying, this is torture!
14563	J.D.	So why don't you just, like, "take care of yo'self"?
14564	Turk	Man, you know I don't do that.
14565	J.D.	You don't?
14566	Turk	Nah, I only did that like twice in my life.
14567	J.D.	Same here.
14568	J.D.'s Thoughts	If by "in my life" you mean "since I got home".If by "in my life" you mean "since dinner".
14569	J.D.	I gotta go to sleep, I'm tired.
14570	Dr. Cox	Ohhhhh, my little newbie-doobie-doo! Say, that whole "telling Jordan how I feel" thing just went terrific, thank you for that. Now I need a place to crash. Where's Naomi's bedroom? Good night, roomies.
14571	J.D.	We gotta get that lock fixed.
14572	Turk	The only lock I gotta get fixed is the one connected to Carla's panties. I need to get a key. I need to call a locksmith. I thought I was the locksmith, man.
14573	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14574	Turk	Then she cut me off, man, just like that. Full prison lock-down, no one gets in or out.
14575	Dr. Cox	Man, that's tough.
14576	J.D.	If you're not gonna use my bed, can I use it?
14577	Dr. Cox	No you may not, on account of this whole Jordan situation being your fault.
14578	J.D.	You told her that spending the day with the baby isn't really a job and that it's turned her into an inflexible shrew!
14579	Dr. Cox	Newbie, you told me to tell her exactly how I feel, I did just that. Now you'll remain on the floor until you come up with a new plan for me.
14580	J.D.	You know, Dr. Cox, I I know this is tough on you what with you being psychotic and all, but, I'm out, okay? It's 3 a.m. and there's nothing in the world that's gonna keep me from going to sleep right now.
14581	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14582	J.D.	What do you mean you changed your mind about surgery?
14583	Randolph	Catherine downloaded some information on alternative treatments diet, exercise, seed implants....
14584	J.D.	No, sir, those are, at best, a stall. Now I know there's trepidation when you talk about surgery in the area of the penis
14585	Randolph	Whoa! Quick pause on the guttertalk! Catherine, hallway.
14586	J.D.	Look, I
14587	Randolph	Go.
14588	J.D.	I know there are possible side-effects, but the incontinence goes away with most patients, and sexual dysfunction can be treated with anything from Viagra to a penis pump.
14589	Randolph	Penis pump? That sounds awkward.
14590	J.D.	Doesn't have to be.
14591	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14592	Randolph	Wow! It's a giraffe!End of discussion! I'm not having the surgery. Although I don't mind that they've shaved me already. Proportionately, everything seems much...grander.
14593	Carla	All right, Elliot, you just have to ease into it, okay? Let's forget about patients for now and start with this.
14594	Elliot	Ohh, my God! She's got a tattoo of a teardrop on her bajingo! Is it sad?
14595	Carla	Her _vagina_, Elliot, she has a tattoo on her beautiful vagina.
14596	Turk	Awwwh! This just isn't fair. Not fair at all. It's ridiculous!
14597	Elliot	This is stupid!
14598	Carla	Elliot, I'm just trying to help.
14599	Elliot	Yeah, you know what Carla, I don't remember asking for your help, okay?
14600	Carla	It does look a little sad. They always do.
14601	Janitor	Hey!
14602	Turk	This is a hospital, why are you playing that song?
14603	Janitor	Ohh! You mean "We Don't Have To Take Our Clothes Off" Jermaine Stewart's classic anthem to platonic love. No reason.
14604	Turk	Whatever it is you're trying to do, it's not working.
14605	Janitor	'Course not, not with you. You're, uh...what'd you say? Untouchable. Well, anyway, back to work.New friend!
14606	Elliot	Mr. Greenberg needs 2.4 milliunits of penicillin IM.
14607	Carla	Why, does he have a spinkle in his gherkin?
14608	Elliot	Carla, you're right, okay? That stuff makes me uncomfortable, and there was a time when that would've sent me into a shame spiral, but now I'm just gonna get over it at my own pace. And until then, I honestly don't mind that you're making fun of me, but what does bother me is that no one is ever allowed to make fun of you.
14609	Carla	People can make fun of me.
14610	Elliot	Come on! What about that delivery guy yesterday? I mean, you practically tore him a new binglebore.
14611	Carla	But he's not my friend. My friends can make fun of me whenever they want.
14612	Elliot	Really? Well, then, in that case you're a know-it-all smartypants and if you're not telling someone what to do, you're probably not talking.
14613	Carla	Okay, I guess I can be a little bossy.
14614	Nurse Roberts	A little? Girl, please! If you met Jesus hisself, you'd be trying to tell him where to park his donkey.
14615	J.D.	Oh, are we allowed to do this now? What about that whole, like, hands on the hips, "Carla from the block" thing she does when she's mad when she's like "Oh, Bambi, you do _not_ want to mess me with right now."
14616	Doug	You do sound like that.
14617	Carla	Careful Doug, we are not that close yet.
14618	J.D.	"Careful, Doug."
14619	Elliot	That's what's up. Mm-mm. Mmm.
14620	J.D.	"Doug, you better be careful, 'cause I'm Carla."Mr. Randolph.
14621	Randolph	What's he doing here? You know I don't like these people.Surgeons. Not African-Americans.
14622	Turk	Oh!... We're actually saying "black" now, sir.
14623	Randolph	I was right, Catherine!
14624	J.D.	Listen sir, I brought Dr. Turk here to help you get over your fear of surgery.
14625	Randolph	I'm not scared.
14626	J.D.	Then what is it?
14627	Randolph	I don't know if you've noticed, but Catherine and I don't always communicate that well.
14628	Turk	No, I can't
14629	J.D.	You're joshing!
14630	Randolph	No, it's true. But when I lay that beautiful woman down onto our bed to make love
14631	Turk	Wow.
14632	J.D.	Oh, God.
14633	Randolph	the walls come tumbling down. It's the one place that I can tell her how wonderful and beautiful she is, and how I would be lost without her. Now I know I will probably have to have this surgery eventually, but until then I am not going to risk losing the one thing that keeps me close to her. Not until I absolutely have to.Yes dear, you can come in.
14634	J.D.'s Narration	Maybe the dirty little secret about sex is that it isn't so dirty after all.
14635	Jordan	Do you think you could try to be a tiny bit mature?
14636	Dr. Cox	Oh, this is me mature. La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!
14637	J.D.	Uh, excuse me.
14638	Dr. Cox & Jordan	Whaaat?!
14639	J.D.	Okay, so there's that.... Uh, look, I realize I let you down before, and I was thinking I could make it up to you by, you know, maybe baby-sitting sometime.
14640	J.D.'s Narration	The weird thing is, even though it's natural, sex can make us uncomfortable.
14641	Elliot	You have a...penis. And I......have a vagina!
14642	Sean	That is so hot.
14643	J.D.'s Narration	But if we work at it, we can get beyond that discomfort.And realize that sex can actually be a comfort.
14644	Turk	Hey, baby. I was just with a patient who made me understand what romance really means. So as far as this no-sex thing goes, I'm with you a hundred percent.
14645	Carla	Everyone I know just spent the last two hours listing my faults. I wanna have sex. Now.
14646	Turk	I'll get the condoms.Sorry.
14647	J.D.'s Narration	Sex can even be a cure.
14648	Dr. Cox	Whoa, that was.... Well, why were you so angry at me?
14649	Jordan	Oh, I don't even remember.
14650	J.D.'s Narration	How do I know all this? Because no one understands how important sex is better than someone who isn't having any.
14651	J.D.	Helloooo, Cinemax.
14652	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14653	J.D.'s Narration	At Sacred Heart, there are certain things you can always count on. Dr. Kelso will systematically break Ted's spirit...
14654	Dr. Kelso	Oh, Ted. I meant to tell you eight months ago, all those days of vacation you saved up expire riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight...now!
14655	Lawyer	But sir! I was going to visit The Alamo with the guys from my public sp ...speaking class!
14656	J.D.'s Narration	...Turk will start a fight with Carla that he'll inevitably lose...
14657	Turk	I don't understand it. This wedding is supposed to be about us how come I can't be comfortable?
14658	Carla	And I don't know how many times I have to tell you that you are not wearing sweats!
14659	Turk	All right, fine! I don't have to wear sweats, I'll wear the slacks! But you know what? I'm also wearing the cape, and we gonna have a wind machine, and I'ma be standing on the altar like, "I DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"
14660	Carla	I'm marrying this! This is gonna be my husband!
14661	Turk	Holler!
14662	J.D.'s Narration	...Sean and Elliot will do whatever they can to keep their long-distance relationship going...
14663	Elliot	I love the new camera phone you got us. ... Really?Did you get it? ... No?
14664	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14665	J.D.'s Narration	...And the janitor will think of new ways to torture me.
14666	Janitor	Hey. Don't open your locker for the next couple of days.
14667	J.D.	Why?
14668	J.D.'s Narration	Still, all you need to break the pattern is for something shocking to happen. Like, say, Dr. Cox being in a good mood.
14669	Dr. Cox	You know, Kyle, after three long years of watching you climb that transplant list, I finally have a liver with your name on it.Check Mr. Iverson into Sacred Heart for the last time, will ya?
14670	J.D.'s Narration	You see, when Dr. Cox is in a good mood, well, it flows out of him like a cool breeze that lifts the spirits of everyone it touches.
14671	Dr. Cox	Ohhh, it's gon'ta be a great day-hey-hey-hey-hey-hey-hey-heyyy....!
14672	Lawyer	Not today! Life's too good!
14673	Dr. Kelso	Chicken.
14674	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14675	Carla	Come on, Turk! I got two minutes left on my break, how long is this surgery gonna take?
14676	Dr. Cox	Carla, cut the guy some slack. Surgery is not as easy as it looks. I mean, he's gotta make the incision, cut the wrong artery, panic, collapse into a ball of tears in the corner, and after all that he's gotta go wash up, check the board, and find out who he'll be killing after lunch. It's...a grind.
14677	Carla	You know, you're always taking shots at Turk, but you've never really told me what you think of him as a person.
14678	Dr. Cox	Me-me-me-me, me-me-me-me-meeee. Ah, there's the right pitch. Um, I think that
14679	Carla	Oh, hold that thought.
14680	Turk	I would _love_ to hear what you have to say.
14681	Dr. Cox	I don't think so, there, bowling ball.
14682	Turk	Well, you might as well spill it Carla tells me everything. Except, of course, about that curling iron you have in your locker. It slipped!It's back!
14683	Dr. Cox	I can totally do this.
14684	Turk	Wha-at?
14685	Dr. Cox	I think that your fiancé is a self-involved, bobble-headed jock itch who is not good enough for you. Not now, not ever.
14686	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14687	Elliot	Carla, if your wedding ceremony's gonna be in Spanish, then how will I know that you're officially married?
14688	Carla	Because all my cousins will throw tortillas in the air and fire their guns.
14689	Elliot	Really?God, I wish I was ethnic!
14690	J.D.'s Narration	It's always hard to work with terminally ill patients.
14691	Carla	Ted's helping Maggie with her will.
14692	Maggie	Thanks again, Ted. How'd you get through sixty pages so quickly?
14693	Lawyer	Well, Miss Hibersol, it helps to not really know what you're doing.
14694	Maggie	Stop it, Ted. You're a great lawyer.
14695	Lawyer	Ohh, I love her.
14696	Elliot	Maggie, you seem so at peace with everything.
14697	Maggie	There's really only one thing I'll regret.... I'm thirty-eight years old and I'm a virgin.
14698	Elliot	Me too.
14699	Carla	Elliot!
14700	Elliot	Sorry, sorry. It's just a reflex from college when I used to play the tambourine in a Christian rock band. Which was bull because everyone was sleeping with everyone. Sorry.
14701	Maggie	That's okay. I guess I was just waiting for someone special, and now I feel like I've missed out on one of the fundamental experiences of life for no good reason, you know?
14702	Carla	Is there anything we can do?
14703	Maggie	Don't people sometimes pay for sex?
14704	Elliot	Oh, boy, do they. I slept with Jenny Johnson's older brother in high school, and then he decided to tell all of his friends what my orgasm face looked like. Then three of them posed like that for their yearbook photos! Paid for that one for years.
14705	Carla	Elliot, I think she means pay _money_ for sex.
14706	Elliot	Oh, I got a story about that, too not about me, though, my mom.... She gets lonely.

14708	J.D.	Isn't it great being so comfortable with someone, you don't have to talk?
14709	Danni	Hmm.
14710	J.D.	Anyway, the point is, silence is awesome.
14711	Danni	I'm sorry, I'm just a little preoccupied. I accidentally walked in on my sister and Perry this morning. Can you imagine?
14712	Dr. Cox	Relax, Newbie, the gimp is chained up.
14713	Jordan	Be careful, though, Randall got loose.
14714	J.D.	Who?Owwwwwwwwwwww! ...Why?Powerful tiny fists....
14715	Danni	I gotta get out of there. You think maybe I could crash at your house?
14716	J.D.	Sure. Just bring your own toilet paper. It's...kind of a little rule we have with our guests.Preferably something two-ply!
14717	Turk	How's it going, Danni?
14718	Danni	Great. I'm crashing at your place tonight.
14719	Turk	Oh, cool.... Bring toilet paper.
14720	J.D.	I already told her.
14721	Turk	How'd you get Dr. Cox to like you?
14722	J.D.	Dr. Cox said he liked me!?
14723	Turk	No, you're missing the point
14724	J.D.	I need to know three things immediately: Where was he when he said it, what inflection did he use, and had he been drinking? You know what, I don't care about the third one; sometimes when you've been drinking you're the most truthful.
14725	Turk	Okay, look, I know Carla's gonna have her little pre-wedding panic attack, and what if she has her good ol' buddy Dr. Cox there to tell her what a jackass I am, huh? Then what?
14726	J.D.	You know what? I'm glad he was drunk.
14727	Turk	Thank you.

14732	Dr. Cox	I don't know what you're talking about, there, butch. I don't know if you're sucking up to me or making a pass at me, but I say you skip it and we continue in our state of mutual disdain.
14733	Turk	Dr. Cox, you got it all wrong, man! I don't disdain you! It's quite the opposite I "dain" you. Yeah. I think if you get to know me better, you just might "dain" me, too.
14734	Dr. Cox	Here that's interesting. Of course, it's gibberish, but it's it's interesting nonetheless. I'm gonna go ahead and pass, and here's why: You're a typical surgeon, and as a rule you guys are insensitive and egotistical and you have the sense of humor of about a fourth grader.
14735	Turk	That's just not true.

14741	J.D.	Randall, could you stop using that expression? Because I can't get it out of my head.
14742	Dr. Kelso	Ladies, explain to me why you are so concerned with my policy on patients having sex in the hospital.
14743	Carla	No reason!
14744	Elliot	Just curious!
14745	Carla	Trying to learn.
14746	Elliot	I love you...sir.
14747	Dr. Kelso	Well, why don't we make it the same as my sex policy with my wife: Absolutely not! Now make me a sandwich.
14748	Mr. Iverson	So, you and Jordan had a kid.
14749	Dr. Cox	Parenthood's pretty amazing.Tell you what, you're all set. Some peon from surgery's gonna come down here and do your pre-op and then you're good to go.

14756	Elliot	Our generation has the exact same morals and values as yours.
14757	Carla	Come on, Elliot. Let's go find ourselves a man-whore!
14758	Elliot	See ya!
14759	J.D.	You know, but she's not moving in permanently. She's just crashing for a while.
14760	Nurse Roberts	Mm-hmm.
14761	Dr. Cox	About a year ago, Jordan said she wanted to "crash for a while." Now my office is a nursery, my closet is my office, my clothes are in the entertainment center, and my TV is in the john, which I guess is kind of nice...I don't even know anymore.
14762	Lawyer	Same thing happened to me. After my divorce, I told Mariana I was going to crash at her place for a few weeks, and we've been sharing a bed for eight years.
14763	J.D.	Isn't Mariana your mother?
14764	Lawyer	Hey, who are we talking about here, you or me?
14765	Dr. Cox	Lookit, here's the rule, there, porn-star: The moment her toothbrush hits your sink, you've got yourself a permanent roomie.
14766	J.D.	How long will you be staying?
14767	Danni	For a while.Mmmmm, downy soft.
14768	J.D.	There'll be toilet paper everywhere!

14776	Elliot	He was Lutheran.
14777	Carla	This is it! This is it! Stop the car.Stop the car. Keep the meter running, we'll be right back.
14778	Elliot	Ha! What a rush! I mean, I have never slept with a prostitute before, but if it is half as much fun as buying one, sign me up!
14779	Cop	Hey! Quiet down back there!
14780	Elliot	Sorry. Heh.

14782	Turk	Now, even though I won't be performing the transplant, I am a key member of the surgical team. It's too complicated to explain what it is I do, but in layman's terms I...I guess you'd call it "watching."
14783	Mr. Iverson	Could you excuse me one second?
14784	Turk	Sure.
14785	Dr. Cox	I taught him that! Well struck, Barry.
14786	Turk	Heh. Heh. Let's let's finish up here, okay?
14787	Mr. Iverson	No, sir.
14788	Turk	Drinking?
14789	Mr. Iverson	Nope.Oh. I had a couple of glasses of champagne at my daughter's wedding last month. But a little champagne's no big deal, huh?
14790	Dr. Cox	Naaahhhh...hahahaha......ah?Look. Barry...Barry's a...he's a great guy.
14791	Turk	Yeah. I totally forgot the rule to the transplant list is no drinking...unless Cox says you're a great guy.
14792	Dr. Cox	Come on, pally, guy's been on the transplant list for three stinkin' years this is a no-brainer.
14793	Turk	You're right. He's out.
14794	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14795	Dr. Kelso	See, this is why you shouldn't get emotionally invested in your patients.
14796	Dr. Cox	Hey, Bobbo, now when the dark prince does finally call you home, please promise me that you'll donate your body to science. And I don't mean medical science, I mean NASA. Because when those buzz-cuts have all but given up on trying to figure out just exactly what a black hole is, and they get one look at that space where your heart was supposed to be, well by-gum, you know they're just gonna say, "Awwww, shucks! That's what it is!"
14797	Dr. Kelso	Hey, champ! What has two thumbs and doesn't give a crap? Bob Kelso. How ya doin'.
14798	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14799	J.D.'s Thoughts	All right, you're just gonna have to tell her she can't move in. It's no big deal, it's not like she has the keys yet.AAAAAAAGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!God, I'm horrible at giving bad news! Wait a sec, I'm a doctor, I give bad news all the time. Just like I did with Mr. Clark this morning. Who does his daughter always remind me of?Molly Ringwald! Heh. Man, she was good in 'The Breakfast Club'. I should rent that again.
14800	J.D.	Hello? ... Yes, this _is_ J.D.! ... I'd _love_ to pick you up at jail!
14801	Elliot	Slim, what are you in for?
14802	Criminal	Robbery.
14803	Elliot	Mm. Prostitution!
14804	Carla	Would you please stop enjoying this so much?
14805	Elliot	Mm! Photo-op!Slammer!
14806	Carla	You need to get your arm off me before I throw that phone of yours up in the street.
14807	Elliot	Why you gotta be playa-hatin'?

14810	Dr. Cox	Ohhh, hey Dr. Turk, you old turtle-headed pain in the ass. Aw! Dammit all, Perry, that is _so_ not what you came down here to say! Now you're _better_ than that! Turn the car around!
14811	Turk	Oh, so the worm has turned, huh? Don't bother. That's what's wrong with you medical guys. You ... never ... know ... when ... to ... face reality and realize that things are never gonna change between us!Ohh! Hell yeah!
14812	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14813	Elliot	Mm, it's so nice to have real food again.
14814	Carla	Elliot, they didn't even feed us.
14815	Danni	I love how much you guys care about your patients.
14816	J.D.'s Thoughts	Wow. Danni is so sweet. What am I worried about?
14817	Danni	You know, Jordan and I are from around here, and our friend Chuck's a stripper? I'm sure he knows tons of guys that would love to have sex with your patient.
14818	J.D.'s Thoughts	What the hell!? What's it gonna be like when she's at my place!?
14819	J.D.	Danni! Can you have the guys practice in the other room, please?
14820	Danni	Stop being such a fuddy-duddy! Now, who haven't I slept with yet?
14821	J.D.	There'll be banana hammocks everywhere!
14822	Carla	Let's roll.

14824	Turk	Excellent work, everyone.
14825	Todd	Nurse, I know you're new here, so I wanted to offer you the chance to assist me in a bypass later. And by that I mean we'd bypass the kissing and go straight to theOh, my God, you're a dude?
14826	Turk	Sorry, Larry.
14827	Todd	Aw, I feel so bad. Look, I'll make it up to him. I will hook him up with......that chick!
14828	Turk	Dude, that's Larry again.
14829	Todd	Ohhh!
14830	Dr. Cox	Oh, hello, and welcome to McSurgeon's. May I take your order? "Yeah, I was thinking about getting a simple operation with no unexpected complications, please?" Oh, gosh, here I'm sorry, we're fresh out of those. But! If you have a child, maybe you'd like to try one of our Infection Meals! That'll be seven thousand dollars, please pay at the second window.
14831	Turk	You know, I'm really getting sick of this
14832	Dr. Cox	Oh! I'm sorry! Are you talking? Because I've decided to keep my finger on the button, so I actually can't hear anything that's going on in there. But, for fairness' sake, I've decided to do your end of the conversation. It goes a little something like this: "Blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, cool hip-hop lingo, blah-blah, blah-blah-blah."
14833	Todd	Don't worry, sweetheart, this'll all be over in a second.
14834	Larry	Please stop.
14835	Todd	Oh! It's the hips that fool me.

14837	Elliot	Hm! Can't believe Chuck gave up stripping to become a city councilman!

14840	Carla	Elliot! You ain't as ghetto as ya think y'are, 'kay? Let's go see how Maggie's doing.
14841	Patient	Hey.
14842	Dr. Cox	Can I help you?
14843	Patient	No. He told me to say hi.
14844	Turk	That's Stephanie, our new transplant patient.
14845	Dr. Cox	Oh. And you picked her, so I'm quite sure she is so very nice.
14846	Turk	No, actually she's alienated every member of my surgical team.
14847	Dr. Cox	Sweetheart, you're not even _on_ the surgical team.
14848	Turk	I am a very important part of the team that! I am a very important part of the team, thankyouverymuch.
14849	Dr. Cox	I see, so what, that's...that's it? You say she gets the liver and that's the way it goes?
14850	Turk	No, she gets the liver because she followed the rules.
14851	Dr. Cox	Ah-ha.
14852	Turk	Dr. Cox, I know it's really hard on you medical guys, because you spend most of your time with your patients and you get emotionally attached. But as a surgeon, the person I'm closest to is the guy who's giving us the liver, because it's a gift, and I think it's important that it goes to the person that's proven they're up to the responsibility.
14853	Dr. Cox	Holy cow, I get it. I gotta collect myself for a moment, here. That's very touching.
14854	Turk	You know I'm right.
14855	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes we forget that rules are there for a reason. Other times, well...
14856	Carla	Uh, she's sleeping, sir.
14857	Dr. Kelso	So?
14858	Elliot	You know, there's cupcakes down in Pediatrics!
14859	Dr. Kelso	Ooh!
14860	J.D.'s Narration	Other times, rules are meant to be broken.
14861	Lawyer	You are so beautiful.
14862	Maggie	That was worth the wait! You are a stallion!
14863	J.D.'s Narration	And once in a while, you have to throw all the rules out the window and know that everything's gonna be okay.
14864	Danni	I feel really good about this!
14865	J.D.	Me too!
14866	J.D.'s Narration	...Or not.Of course, some rules are just plain silly.
14867	Dr. Cox	Ya got big plans for tonight?
14868	Carla	Oh.... It's Turk's stupid rule, I don't wanna talk about it.
14869	Dr. Cox	He is a complete tool.... But I suppose you could do a lot worse.
14870	Carla	Thanks.
14871	Dr. Cox	Bye.

14873	J.D.	Hey, Chocolate Bear. I didn't have time to shower this morning. Did you wax your dome?
14874	Turk	I sure did! Why?
14875	J.D.	Thanks, pal!
14876	Turk	Uh-huh....
14877	J.D.	Hold up!Chapped!
14878	Turk	Easy, Moose , that stuff is forty bucks a tin.
14879	J.D.'s Narration	With the long hours at a hospital, you don't have time to worry about your appearance.It may sound sexist, but with the female doctors, it's slightly more noticeable.
14880	J.D.	Hey, Janice. Is it windy out?
14881	Janice	No. Why do you always ask me that!?
14882	J.D.	Because I'm I'm captain of m-m-my kite-flying team? The M-m-mighty Kites?
14883	J.D.'s Thoughts	Agh! Okay, just say something innocuous.
14884	J.D.	Good morning, gentlemen.
14885	J.D.'s Narration	The truth is most of them don't even bother trying. Except of course...
14886	Elliot	Hey, girlfriends!

14888	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14889	Elliot	Oh, this? Heh. Yeah, it doesn't take long.
14890	J.D.'s Narration	I guess everyone has their morning routines.
14891	Mother	Hi, cutie! Since you have so many balls, and too many toys can be over-stimulating for an infant, Brantley here was wondering if he could borrow one to play with!
14892	Dr. Cox	Oh, that's funny, because Jack here was just wondering why the crazy lady who just spent the last hour chain smoking and talking on her cell phone while her kid ate sand would come over to two complete strangers and give them parenting advice!
14893	Jordan	Oh, oh! He also thanked me for not naming him "Brantley"!
14894	Dr. Cox	Y-yeah.I love our family.

14899	J.D.	Anyway, where's Danni? We're gonna be late for our movie.
14900	Danni	Stop. Lemme just go grab a sweater. I love you.
14901	Turk	Wow, she's using the "L word" now.
14902	J.D.	Yeeeaaah, but we're not really that serious.This isn't the movies?
14903	Danni	I just wanted you to see this; because if I move here permanently, this would be the type of place we could afford.
14904	Turk	Out of body experience?
14905	J.D.	Yeah. She wants to move in together. I have to break up with her!
14906	Turk	Dude, relax. Enjoy the show. Have a Bugle.
14907	J.D.	Ooh!
14908	Turk	Ooh, your ghost hands is cold!
14909	Danni	J.D.!?
14910	J.D.	I wanted to put them on my fingers and pretend I had witch nails.

14912	J.D.	Nothing.
14913	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14914	Dr. Cox	I just can't believe how comfortable I've gotten talking to you over these last few months. I mean, look, I'd still be with my old shrink if I hadn't cut across the park the day of the renaissance faire and realized that the man I tell my innermost secrets to likes to...likes to put on a big, giant beard and make pretend that he is a blacksmith....I've even started complimenting people.
14915	Todd	Oh, come on! Get your pump on!
14916	Dr. Cox	God help me, Sluggo, if you get any more buff, I'll be absolutely sure that you're gay!
14917	Todd	Oh, I'm gonna get more buff!
14918	Elliot	Dr. Cox never compliments me about anything!
14919	Janitor	Well, he should. Your new look has completely changed my perspective. For instance, this is not a broom with fraying edges this is now a broom that reminds me of blonde doctor's bangs. Tough and spunky!
14920	Elliot	Oh, my God! That is exactly the look that I was going for!
14921	Janitor	Really!?
14922	Elliot	Yeah!
14923	Janitor	Shoobity-doo! Hey! How 'bout I give you a ride to your next destination?
14924	Elliot	To the morgue! Watch it!
14925	J.D.	Hey!
14926	Turk	So, did you break up with her?
14927	J.D.	I was going to last night, but then I looked in her eyes, and I realized how rare it is to meet someone who's actually willing to have sex with me.
14928	Carla	How did you have sex with the woman you're about to break up with?
14929	J.D.	Okay, you know how the, uh, couch in the living room has those high arms...?
14930	Turk	Babe, you gotta understand, a guy will sleep with any woman he finds attractive, no matter how he feels about her. If Tyra Banks drove her car over my mom and then offered to have sex with me? I'd have to dial 9-1-1 in the nude because my pants would already be off!
14931	Carla	That's sweet! While your mother lays there dying!
14932	Turk	Tell her.
14933	J.D.	His mom doesn't die. Tyra uses her connections in the supermodel world to get government scientists to put Turk's mom's brain into Heidi Klum's body. She falls in love with me, we all move in together.
14934	Turk	It'd be awkward at first, but I'd make it work.... 'Cause I love my mom.
14935	J.D.	Mm, and I would love her, too.
14936	Carla	New low.

14938	Elliot	Oh, Mrs. Gorski, I know shingles are never fun. Unless you're talking about the games we made up the summer my parents got a new roof. It was kind of like Hide & Seek, only we'd throw shingles at each other? Ahh, summer time.... Still, a positive attitude can go a long way in helping you feel better, so let's see a big ol' smile!
14939	Dr. Kelso	Excuse me. Can I borrow Dr. Reid?
14940	Mrs. Gorski	You may keep her.
14941	Dr. Kelso	Here at Sacred Heart, I like to think that our patients choose our hospital not only because I leak vicious rumors about competing hospitals to the press, but also because when they see one of our doctors they think, "Now that's a professional!"
14942	Elliot	Um, I don't think I look unprofessional.
14943	Dr. Kelso	I've let this whole new look thing slide the last few months, but now that your colleagues are beginning to complain I'm going to give you the same advice I give my son every morning. Lose the makeup! Get a haircut! And stop using my razor to shave your fun zone!
14944	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14945	J.D.	I hate missing practice.

14947	& J.D.	Mighty Kiiiiites!
14948	Dr. Cox	Morning, class. As residency director, it is my pleasure to have both Surgical and Medical personnel here with us today. In fact, in this room we have enough brain power to light up a city! Not a real city, mind you, but definitely a tiny ant city whose government has recently passed a series of stringent energy conservation laws!
14949	Doug	Stringent what?
14950	J.D.	"Stringent updoc".It's happening.
14951	Dr. Cox	Yes, Nervous Guy?
14952	Doug	What's "updoc"?
14953	Dr. Cox	Okay, people, biphasic defibrillators. How many of you had a chance to practice on the mannequin?
14954	Todd	Oh, yeah.
14955	Dr. Cox	...With the defibrillator...?
14956	Todd	Uhhhh....
14957	Elliot	Ugh.
14958	Dr. Cox	And I assume none of you have even looked at the literature.I didn't do anything. No yelling, no breaking stuff, nothing. And right then , I figured out what's different. I figured out what that feeling was that I was having in the park the other day with my family. I'm...happy. Now does that not just make you sick? Ugh!

14960	Turk	Dude, with Danni you just gotta keep your eyes on the prize. Focus in on how great it is to be single! Chasing tail! Hell, I miss it every day.
14961	Carla	Oh, you don't care if you ever have sex again, do you?
14962	Turk	Baby, listen, I'm just trying to keep my man psyched, 'cause since I've known J.D., he's never broken up with anyone.
14963	J.D.	He's right. I don't like hurting people. But with Danni, I'm gonna do the honorable thing I'm gonna have someone in a fireman's outfit tell her I burned to death.
14964	Carla	Bambi, you owe her closure. Hell, you owe it to every woman you've ever dated.
14965	J.D.	Listen, Danni.......Lisa.... Drunk girl who was friends with the girl I really wanted to hook up with.... It's not all of you. It's me.Scott Gerber?!
14966	Scott	At soccer camp, I told you I wanted to be more than friends.
14967	J.D.	I thought you meant teammates!
14968	Scott	Well, I didn't!

14974	Danni	Me too. I just feel like my life is so scattered lately and you're the only good thing I have going right now.
14975	J.D.	Awesome.
14976	Carla	How's he doing?
14977	Nurse Roberts	The boy's got no biscuits.
14978	J.D.	I am trying to break someone's heart here, okay!?
14979	Danni	I'm feeling really bummed. Do you have a second to talk?
14980	J.D.	Actually, I'm kinda swamped right now, uh, let me get back to you, okay?Elliot, what's wrong?
14981	Elliot	Eh, forget it, you're busy.
14982	J.D.	Come on! I always have time for you!
14983	Elliot	Have the other doctors been making fun of the way I look?
14984	Carla	What? No! No way! Why would you say that?
14985	J.D.	Huh? I've never heard anything like that! Why?
14986	Nurse Roberts	Hell, yeah.

15001	Turk	Damn!
15002	J.D.	Besides, I gotta go deal with this whole Danni thing.
15003	Turk	You want me to just talk to her for you? I'll do it.
15004	J.D.	Nah, that's weak. I mean, if someone doesn't care about you enough to break up with you themselves, it's like they didn't ever care about you at all.

15012	J.D.	I still don't understand why Danni's breaking up with me, man. I gotta go talk to her.Okay, first of all, words cannot describe the smell that is currently on my cheek.
15013	Turk	You get out clean, and now you wanna go back in just 'cause she rejected you? Who else is that crazy?
15014	Dr. Cox	Not one resident showed up. Not one. Would you like to know why? Because they're not scared of me anymore. And I blame you. Yes. You have turned me into this soft, emotionally open, pathetic freak at home, and now it's starting to bleed over into work.
15015	Staff	"...Happy birthday to you!"

15053	J.D.'s Narration	I know it's a cliché, but ______ say that it is indeed the calm before the storm that lets you know that danger's coming.
15054	J.D.'s Thoughts	Uh-oh.
15055	Dr. Cox	First off, let me just say...thank you. For the last couple of months I have been adrift in a sea of puppy dogs, lollipops, and, let's face it, mediocre metaphors. Luckily, you people were kind enough to piss all over learning a procedure that could determine whether some poor sucker lives or dies. And that reminded me of something that I wanted to remind _you_ of. Because, you see, I am accountable. I am accountable for the continuous, crashing, undeniable amateurism that you people drag into this hospital day in and day out.Okay! Nervous Guy! Bring that nervous butt up here, lose the shirt; we're gonna show these good people how this thing works.Nice tan, there, champ.
15056	Doug	Thanks?
15057	Dr. Cox	Clear!
15058	J.D.'s Narration	After Dr. Cox exploded at us, so many thoughts were racing through my head: We have been slacking off lately. How did Doug get such incredible abs? And what the hell is the deal with Danni?
15059	Danni	Hey.
15060	J.D.	Hey.After you dressed up Rowdy, did you trim the clumpy areas around his butt?
15061	Danni	Yeah...?
15062	J.D.	Oh.... Thanks. He was due for a good grooming.
15063	Danni	Look....
15064	J.D.	Just tell me why.
15065	Danni	Your cell phone wasn't turned off.
15066	J.D.	What?
15067	Danni	When you called me.
15068	J.D.	Actually I'm swamped, Danni. Sorry, I gotta go.

15070	J.D.	Elliot, what's wrong?
15071	Elliot	Oh.... Forget it, you're busy.
15072	J.D.	Come on! I always have time for you!That stupid phone! You know, that's the same way Turk found out I collect scarves!
15073	J.D.'s Thoughts	Ooooh!
15074	Danni	J.D.
15075	J.D.	Sorry.
15076	Danni	you're still not over Elliot. And until you are, no one's ever gonna have a chance to get close to you. Right?That silence? That's you breaking up with me.
15077	J.D.'s Thoughts	Hey! I finally broke up with someone!
15078	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
15079	Carla	How you doing, Elliot?
15080	Elliot	Great! I figure I spend three quarters of my life in a place filled with misery and sickness; if I need to feel good about myself, then the hell with everybody!
15081	Carla	And for what it's worth, I think you look beautiful I wouldn't change a thing.
15082	Elliot	Ohh.... Oh! I did, uh, tone down the eye makeup a little bit.
15083	Carla	Oh, thank God! You looked so slutty.
15084	Elliot	There! All done.
15085	Mrs. Gorski	I look hot!
15086	J.D.'s Narration	Everybody has their own way of getting through the day.For some, it's as simple as standing up for a friend......and getting away with it.
15087	Dr. Cox	I I know what you're thinking, believe me, I...I do: Why in the world would a civilized, up-town man of the millennium such as myself even go ahead and give a good rat's ass about whether a bunch of snot-nosed baby docs were afraid of him. Right? Well, unfortunately the only way I know how to teach is through fear.And again, sorry about the gay sailor's outfit. Your mother _loves_ it. She couldn't be more pleasant when you have it on. Take it off nut bag. Have it on pleasant, approachable....
15088	J.D.'s Narration	As for me, if I'm not over Elliot, I might as well wait it out for the long haul. After all, it doesn't mean I'm gonna ignore opportunity if it falls in my lap.

15090	J.D.	Hey! Sheila!

15095	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
15096	J.D.'s Narration	Everyone here thinks they know me inside and out.
15097	Female Staffer	You look like you could use some help.
15098	J.D.	Nope.
15099	J.D.'s Narration	Even random people.
15100	Male Staffer	You need help, Dr. Dorian?
15101	J.D.	No thanks, Dr...whatever your name is.
15102	J.D.'s Narration	They won't leave me alone.
15103	Doctor	Free help, here.
15104	J.D.	Piss off, Mickhead.
15105	J.D.'s Narration	You'd think by now they'd know where I'm gonna end up.
15106	J.D.	Dr. Cox? I could use a little help.
15107	Dr. Cox	Beyoncé, you could use a lot of help. But, hey, we all have to play the hand the Big Guy dealt us. You know, unless you're lucky enough to have those insanely over-hyped 'Queer Eye' guys show up at your door, but I doubt even they have the brass ones necessary to fix whatever the hell this is.
15108	J.D.	Yeah, if you wanna use the appearance angle to knock down my self-esteem, best to do it on a day when my hair doesn't look awesome! I know it's new wax.
15109	Nurse Roberts	What is?
15110	J.D.	It's okay to want a piece!I just want you to check out Mrs. Barlow's chart; I'm always second-guessing myself when it comes to interstitial lung diseases.
15111	Dr. Cox	Oh, then you should definitely handle this yourself, there, Britney.
15112	J.D.	Got it.
15113	Dr. Cox	Noo.... I'm a good doctor.
15114	J.D.	Oh.
15115	Dr. Cox	Here you go.
15116	Turk	Oh, hello, Mr. Gallbladder. Don't you get too comfy next to Mr. Liver. Because here comes Dr. Turk's robot laser.
15117	Dr. Wen	Hey, Christopher. I could do without the color commentary.
15118	Turk	Why it gotta be a "color commentary"? 'Cause I'm doing it?
15119	Dr. Wen	That was a near-perfect laparoscopic cholecystectomy!Have you been working on your dexterity?
15120	Turk	Well, I've been playing a little John Madden Football on my X-Box....
15121	Todd	I'd like to play John Madden Football...on _her_ x-box.
15122	Turk	On who, Todd? There are no women here.
15123	Todd	Well, it's still funny!
15124	Dr. Wen	The Todd here used to be our number one lap-chole guy. But the torch has been passed.
15125	Turk	Thank you, sir!Dude! Yo, wait till you hear this!Dr. Wen just said that I'm their number one lap-chole guy now!
15126	Dr. Wen	Disappointed?
15127	Todd	I shoulda waited till there was a chick around to make that "x-box" joke, you know?He knows....
15128	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
15129	J.D.'s Narration	I was excited for Turk. And, God bless him, he was excited about my big hair news!
15130	Turk	New wax did that?
15131	J.D.	I couldn't believe it either!
15132	Carla	New wax did that?
15133	Elliot	I couldn't believe it either!
15134	Carla	Oh.Ye oh, sorry about the girl talk.
15135	J.D.	Oh, that's fine. We were talking man talk...you know....
15136	Turk	Really big trucks...
15137	J.D.	Solo-Flex...
15138	Turk	Have you seen these lately?
15139	J.D.	Sweat.
15140	Carla	Your hair smells like Elliot's.
15141	J.D.	Well, your breath smells like chimichangas!
15142	Carla	Is that racist?
15143	Elliot	That depends. Did you have chimichangas for breakfast?
15144	Carla	Maybe....
15145	J.D.'s Narration	I think what Carla really smelled was all the excitement in the air. See, there's a visiting professor coming today who's both a medical attending and a surgeon. _Two_ specialties, and to us that kinda makes him......Super-Doc!...Super-Doc...
15146	Dr. Casey	Dammit!
15147	J.D.'s Narration	...Fine. A super-doc with obsessive-compulsive disorder.
15148	Dr. Casey	Okay, okay. How hard can it be for me to step in here, left foot first and simultaneously exhale as my right foot plants? How hard?
15149	Turk	Not that hard?
15150	Dr. Casey	Exactly! ...Shaved-head guy.
15151	Carla	Hers.And his.
15152	J.D.	Huh?
15153	Dr. Casey	That's very pretty. And deeply disturbing.
15154	J.D.	The jar said unisex.
15155	Turk	I know.
15156	J.D.	_Unisex_.

15162	Dr. Casey	That's the word! Dr. Kevin Casey....
15163	Carla	Why do you keep saying your name?
15164	Dr. Casey	Oh, it just keeps me from losing my, uh...jinkies later, thinking I forgot something.
15165	Carla	Okay....
15166	Dr. Casey	Dr. Kevin Casey.... Dr. Kevin Casey.It's okay, you can say it.
15167	J.D.	It's just that you're...you're a doctor with pretty severe OCD.
15168	Dr. Casey	It's not a secret.
15169	J.D.	I know. I always talk like this.
15170	Dr. Casey	You're gonna have a hard time keeping that up the whole month I'm here.
15171	J.D.	I can do it!
15172	Dr. Casey	I believe in you!
15173	Dr. Cox	Kevin Casey? Holy cow, get outta Dodge! Te-tell me this, are you are ya shaking hands nowadays?
15174	Dr. Casey	Well, a lifetime of therapy...and a...whole lotta Zoloft...just so I can appropriately greet you, big guy!
15175	Dr. Cox	Atta boy!
15176	Dr. Casey	I do have a two-second limit.
15177	Dr. Cox	Boy, who doesn't!You realize I haven't laid eyes on you since we were residents together? And I'll tell you this, big Kev-o, I always knew I'd see ya again.Boy, I never thought I'd see that guy again!
15178	J.D.	I can't imagine you as a resident.
15179	Resident	Hey, Coxy!
15180	Dr. Cox	Shut up, jackass! I rock!
15181	J.D.	Was the blond hair and the earring 'cause you were in a rock band or 'cause you loved pirates?
15182	Dr. Cox	What?
15183	J.D.'s Thoughts	Loved pirates! Just like me!
15184	Nurse Roberts	I _don't_ want a piece.
15185	J.D.	Well you're the only one. Okay?
15186	Dr. Cox	Look, Pink, for the billionth time, no, I will not go out for a beer with you. Now repeat after me: Dr. Cox, you are not now, nor will you ever be, my mentor.

15192	Dr. Kelso	Stop babbling, Ted. No one's ever listening.
15193	Janitor	My new associate Randall and I can get rid of that garbage for you.
15194	Dr. Kelso	What the hell are you two doing here?

15204	J.D.'s Narration	I have to say it was amazing watching Dr. Casey work.
15205	Dr. Casey	All right, Carol, let's just put it out there you've got Lupus. But instead of dwelling on the negative, let's look at the positive signs, okay? Your, uh, pericarditis is resolving, your renal function is good
15206	Dr. Cox	Suicidal scavenger birds also an excellent sign, right Doctor?
15207	J.D.	It's a great sign.
15208	Dr. Casey	Okie-dokie, artichokie.
15209	J.D.	You are unflappable!
15210	Dr. Casey	It's true I can't be flapped.
15211	J.D.	I'm more skittish.
15212	Dr. Casey	Yeah, you know, you're like a big squirrel.
15213	J.D.	I wish a was a swashbuckling doctor. You know...like a pirate.
15214	J.D.'s Thoughts	Enough about pirates! Wait until you know him better.
15215	Dr. Casey	Ahoy, there.
15216	J.D.	You going to the, uh... O.Arrr? Heh.
15217	J.D.'s Thoughts	I said enough!
15218	Dr. Casey	You know, I couldn't have survived in medicine if I didn't embrace my OCD. And since I was compulsive anyway, you know, I I read the same text books over and over, I, uh, I went through the procedures over and over, I imagined every worst-case scenario over and over and over and over and over and over and over
15219	J.D.	Dr. Casey.
15220	Dr. Casey	and over and over and over
15221	J.D.	Dr. Casey!
15222	Dr. Casey	Dr. Kevin Casey.
15223	J.D.	Oh.
15224	Dr. Casey	Thank you.
15225	J.D.	Yeah.
15226	Dr. Casey	Even though my crazy brain made me do those things, it's still the best advice I can give to any young doctor: Expect the unexpected and you will never be surprised.
15227	J.D.'s Narration	It's weird, after one day it already felt like he was the type of mentor I always wished Dr. Cox would be. Still, I've gotta stay cool; I know I'm prone to hero worship.
15228	Dr. Casey	Man, the surgeon in me is antsy. I need to cut somebody up.Thanks for volunteering. I'm not really that strong on the brain. I think this is the language center.
15229	J.D.	Really? 'Cause I don't feel the daaaaaaaiiiiiioooooooowwww...heh-heh-how cool is thaaaat!

15242	Elliot	If there is one thing I've learned at this hospital, it's that you should never antagonize your boss...or the people that make the food, because either way you end up eating poo. Hear it, learn it, live it. Huh?
15243	Turk	Elliot, I can do whatever I want. Because these......are magic!These? Are gonna take me wherever I wanna go in life.Thanks to these! I'm king of the world, baby! Can you feel it!? Gimme your pudding!!Domo arigato!

15256	Carla	You get out.
15257	Dr. Cox	I know. But soon enough I established myself as the best damn doctor that ever roamed around these filthy halls; which is a curse, actually, because now I'm expected to make eye contact with every insult to medicine that comes into this dump.

15265	Dr. Cox	I beg your pardon?
15266	Dr. Casey	I took the liberty of testing his blood for deficiency of beta-glucosidase.

15340	Dr. Casey	Good. 'Cause you know, those those losers who've been practicing medicine for three years but are still looking for some kind of mentor to pat 'em on the back are just...pathetic, you know what I mean?
15341	J.D.	Totally.
15342	J.D.'s Narration	Yep. It's funny what one person can do.
15343	Dr. Casey	Aw, okay, I'm gonna need another beer.
15344	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
15345	J.D.'s Narration	None of us slept last night. How I know that is irrelevant. What does matter is I think we formed a special bond because of it.
15346	Dr. Cox	Stop looking at me or die.
15347	J.D.'s Narration	What's worse is that the guy who caused it thinks we're his best friends.
15348	Dr. Casey	Morning, fellas!
15349	Dr. Cox	Whatta say there, Kev.
15350	J.D.	Hey, yeah.
15351	Turk	Eh, morning.
15352	Dr. Casey	All right, all six of your butt cheeks just, uh, tightened up.
15353	Dr. Cox	Uh.
15354	J.D.	Uh.
15355	Turk	Uh?
15356	Dr. Casey	Someone around here pissing you guys off? 'Cause I will give 'em some attitude.
15357	J.D.	Uhhh.... That guy!
15358	Dr. Casey	Hey, Hair Club! That suit, that come with the flop sweat?
15359	Ted the Lawyer	You can do this, Theodore! Take as much time as you need.Okay.... Here we go, baby.
15360	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
15361	Carla	I just don't understand why this guy bothers him so much.
15362	Jordan	Carla, Perry is a dysfunctional, unsuccessful, emotionally-damaged old man! No offense, sweetie.
15363	Dr. Cox	None taken.
15364	Jordan	Being the best doctor here is the only thing he had to hang his hat on.
15365	Dr. Cox	Listen, just because we have a child together doesn't necessarily mean you know me, mmm'kay, princess? Watch and learn.Say, Kev-Kev? Would you love to come and join us?
15366	Dr. Casey	Oh, thanks.
15367	Carla	Um, what's up with the oatmeal today?
15368	Dr. Cox	Too much milk.
15369	Carla	No.
15370	Dr. Casey	Not enough butter.
15371	Carla	That's it!
15372	Dr. Cox	Did you just diagnose the oatmeal? You can't just go and diagnose the oatmeal.
15373	Jordan	He just did.
15374	Dr. Casey	Yeah. Why, are you?
15375	Jordan	I'm thinking about it.
15376	Carla	Heh. Yeah, me too.
15377	Dr. Cox	What what in the hell...just happened? Just.... J What just happened!?
15378	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
15379	Turk	Okay, I've removed the gallbladder, sealed the vessels, aaaand time!
15380	Elliot	Oh, my God! You can't even beat Dr. Kevin Casey's lap-chole time when you're _imagining_ it!
15381	Turk	So! I could be just as fast if I was like him and practiced over and over again on a simulator.
15382	Elliot	Yeah...but you don't.
15383	Turk	Yeah, well I could spend my spare time doing stupid hand exercises!
15384	Elliot	I know...but you don't.
15385	Turk	Yeah, well, I could
15386	Elliot	You don't.
15387	Turk	But
15388	Elliot	Don't!
15389	Turk	Could you enjoy this any less?
15390	Elliot	Because of theeeeeeeese! I don't think I can.
15391	Turk	In! Gallbladder! Out! Done! Four seconds! A new record! World record!
15392	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
15393	J.D.	Look, I did my psych rotation, okay? I know my father abandoning us and only showing up in my life when he needs a place to sleep or a free prostate exam is probably gonna be an issue. I get it. But it's not like I'm looking for a a mentor...I just want a little validation. It's like when Kelso gave you a cupcake 'cause you went four days without killing a patient.
15394	Doug	That was awesome!
15395	J.D.	You know!
15396	J.D.'s Thoughts	I've always felt like Doug understood me. It's weird; after knowing him for three years, I suddenly realized he was the type of mentor I always wished Dr. Cox would be.Wait!
15397	J.D.	Doug, get the hell outta here!
15398	Doug	Okay.
15399	J.D.'s Narration	I think when rational men are forced to face their shortcomings they all do the same thing: Blame Kevin Casey! Who gave him the right to judge me? 'Cause I sure didn't! I'll give him a piece of my mind! See how he likes it! Unfortunately no one knew where the son of a bitch was!
15400	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Dorian! I'm far too irritable right now to pretend I don't hate you, so let's cut to the chase.If you know where all the garbage in this hospital is going, I'll give you......eight dollars.
15401	J.D.	Sorry, sir.
15402	Janitor	Thanks!
15403	Dr. Kelso	Huh?
15404	Carla	Dr. Kelso?
15405	Dr. Kelso	What?
15406	Carla	The crows are back. They're making your pimp-mobile look like SpinArt.
15407	Dr. Kelso	Dammit!
15408	Ted the Lawyer	It's just one step. Come on, already! Aww, who'm I kidding?You did it, Teddy! It's over! Here comes sweet relief!Is this heaven?
15409	Janitor	It's garbage.
15410	Randall	Way to cost us a cherry gig, bra.
15411	Ted the Lawyer	Wha?
15412	Dr. Kelso	I want my money back! And Ted! Shower and get back to work!
15413	Janitor	You know, if you try that around the corner, you can land right in the street.
15414	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
15415	J.D.'s Thoughts	Found him! Brace yourself, mister! You're about to get an earful! J.D. style!
15416	J.D.	Hey, buddy.
15417	Dr. Casey	Hey...hey.... Uh, give give me a minute, will you?
15418	J.D.	No, Kevin, I have to talk to you _right_ _now_.
15419	Dr. Casey	DAMMIT!
15420	J.D.	Later's cool too.
15421	Dr. Casey	I'm sorry. I just, I... Look, I spent the last few days meeting new people and...trying to get used to this place, and I'm stressed and I'm fried......and I just want to go home.... But here's the punchline: even though my last surgery was two hours ago, I can't stop washing my damn hands.AAAAAAAAGGGGGGGHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
15422	J.D.	I'm sorry....
15423	Dr. Casey	No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look...this is a weak moment. Nobody's supposed to see this. And, uh, mark my words, I'll clean up the soap. ...Probably several thousand times.Everyone's got their own burdens, J.D., and I'm not gonna be one of those people that dumps mine on somebody else. Now whatta you need?
15424	J.D.	Nothing.
15425	J.D.'s Narration	None of us needed anything.
15426	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
15427	J.D.'s Narration	I think owning your burdens is half the battle.
15428	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
15429	J.D.'s Narration	Turk knows that he'll eventually have to decide what his priorities really are....
15430	Carla	Baby. Come to bed.
15431	J.D.'s Narration	And Dr. Cox knows he has to find something else to hang his hat on.
15432	Dr. Cox	You, my friend, are going to be the best baseball player in the world. Which will make me the best baseball player in the world's father.Can't you hear it, Jack? Can't you hear it?
15433	J.D.'s Narration	Still, it's not that daunting if you look around and see what other people have to deal with.
15434	J.D.	Goodnight, Dr. Casey.
15435	Dr. Casey	'Night, J.D.
15436	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
15437	J.D.'s Narration	I'm running a little late this morning, but that's okay because I've been working with Dr. Casey the last few weeks.
15438	Dr. Casey	Bink. Bink. Bink. Bink, bink bink...
15439	J.D.'s Narration	...by touching everything in his first patient's room.
15440	Dr. Casey	...Bink, bink, bink, bink. Bink. Bink. Bink. Bink.Bink, bink, bink, bink, bink, bink, bink, bink, bink, bink...
15441	Dr. Kelso	Good morning, doctors.
15442	J.D.'s Narration	He touches everything.
15443	Dr. Casey	Bink.
15444	Dr. Kelso	Oh. Okay. I suppose that's how they say good morning in Cuckoo Town.
15445	Dr. Casey	Pretty much. Bink.
15446	Dr. Kelso	Now. Your patients on this wing have all been complaining about odd noises.
15447	Dr. Casey	Oh, if it's a "bink" I can explain.
15448	Dr. Kelso	It isn't "bink"! Stop saying "bink"!
15449	J.D.	Was it "I come from the land down under! Where women glow and men plunder!" That wasn't me.
15450	Dr. Kelso	Just figure it out, dammit!
15451	Dr. Casey	Do you plunder?
15452	J.D.	I have been known to plunder.
15453	Janitor	That, my friends, is a roof toilet.
15454	Dr. Casey	I'm sorry, you said that like it's a normal thing.
15455	J.D.	Be careful with this guy, he's uh....
15456	Janitor	Hey! You're the guy that's been using up all my soap!
15457	Dr. Casey	Yeah, I've got OCD.
15458	Janitor	Really!? My grandpa had that. Every morning he'd take a gym sock, fill it up with nickels, and just beat us! That's OCD, right?
15459	J.D.	The bad kind.
15460	Dr. Casey	Who would use this thing?
15461	Janitor	You kiddin'? Oh, man! Just picture yourself, you're standing out here, in the open air, then you sit down and you take stock of your life.
15462	J.D.'s Thoughts	Damn him. He's right.
15463	Janitor	Listen, pal. I don't want you telling anybody about my epiphany toilet.
15464	J.D.	Who'm I gonna tell?
15465	Janitor	Ehp! Don't even think about it!
15466	J.D.	And get this: He calls it his "epiphany toilet"!
15467	Elliot	Yeah, you couldn't pay me to poop on the roof.
15468	Turk	No one's offering.
15469	J.D.	You're like Dr. Casey. I think he said using that toilet would be like his Everest.
15470	Dr. Casey	Using that toilet would be my Everest.
15471	J.D.	Yep, that's what he said.
15472	Turk	Huh.
15473	Carla	Ask him.
15474	Turk	Why?
15475	Carla	J.D.!
15476	Turk	Huh?
15477	Carla	Turk wants to ask you something, and it would mean a lot to the both of us if you said yes.
15478	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, my God! _Would_ I have a threesome with Turk and Carla? Well, it's certainly flattering, and I don't think they'd tell anyone....
15479	Turk	Will you be my best man?
15480	J.D.	Oh.
15481	Turk	Huh?
15482	J.D.	I mean, YEAH! Of course!
15483	Turk	Hell yeah, you will!
15484	J.D.	Thank you so much!
15485	Turk	You're my buddy! Yeah!
15486	Elliot	So is this, like, the best moment you guys have ever had?
15487	J.D.	A decoder ring! Heh.TURK!
15488	Turk	What?
15489	J.D.	It finally happened!
15490	Turk	A double-prizer?That was awesome.
15491	Carla	You guys realize you're doctors, right?
15492	J.D.	Double secret decoder ring-wearing doctors.Form of an ice menorah!
15493	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
15494	J.D.'s Narration	The reason I'm gurney surfing aside from the fact that it's totally bitchin' is that Kelso shut down this whole wing.
15495	Turk	Dude, I gotta go.
15496	J.D.	Oh, no!
15497	Turk	Oh!
15498	J.D.'s Narration	You see, a census said that hospital admissions dropped in February.The census...was wrong.
15499	Carla	Dr. Kelso! Where are we gonna fit these people? They're all sick!
15500	Dr. Kelso	It's not my job to take care of sick people.
15501	Dr. Cox	"Bob Kelso Healer"
15502	Dr. Kelso	Closing that wing saves us about sixty thousand dollars a month. You got that on you?
15503	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
15504	J.D.'s Narration	It's weird how much Dr. Casey has influenced me in such a short time.
15505	J.D.	Bink!
15506	Nurse Roberts	Hey! Bink you!
15507	J.D.'s Narration	And it wasn't just me. Dr. Casey has affected everyone.
15508	J.D.	What's he doing?
15509	Elliot	He's writing Dr. Casey a thank-you card.
15510	Todd	I could use a little help here.
15511	Turk	Todd, surgeon is spelled "-g-e-o-n"? And, uh...there are two Ds in "Todd".
15512	Todd	Yeah....
15513	Dr. Cox	I'm sorry, does mean stare at me like jackasses or does it mean get the hell over here?All right, then. Mr. Tanaka here is fatiguing and he needs to be intubated. Any questions?
15514	J.D.	Yeah, Turk has asked me to be his best man. You got any advice?
15515	Dr. Cox	Nuh-no. No. I don't. Not at this moment.
15516	Elliot	You know what sucks? Everyone keeps talking about how Dr. Casey has helped them, and he doesn't even know I exist!
15517	J.D.	So introduce yourself.
15518	Elliot	I haven't seen him all day. He's probably off trying to help figure out some procedure that's gonna help save humanity!
15519	Dr. Casey	Why can't I sit on you!? Why?
15520	J.D.	Probably.
15521	Dr. Cox	Newbie! It turns out I, uh, I do have some best man advice. Go easy on the mascara in case you cry during your toast. And if you're gonna chase after the bouquet with all of the other girls, make sure you kick off your pumps so you don't snap one of those chicken ankles of yours.
15522	J.D.	Thanks. Thanks for coming back.
15523	Dr. Cox	Barbie. Are you sure you went into his lungs? 'Cause it looks like you're blowing up his stomach.Aw, dammit, his O2 sat's dropping. Get out of the way, honey; come on.
15524	J.D.'s Narration	Even if you've done a procedure five thousand times, there's no guarantee you won't screw up number five thousand, one.
15525	Dr. Cox	A few more seconds, we would have been coding this guy.Barbie, as hard as it is to remember, but _air_ goes in _the lungs_.
15526	J.D.	Can I practice my toast on you?
15527	Dr. Cox	No.
15528	J.D.	I'm opening with a quote from 'Spartacus'.
15529	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
15530	J.D.	Actually it...goes a little lower.
15531	Turk	I don't know why Carla wants me to wear a cummerbund, let alone a red one.
15532	J.D.	Well, come on. As your best man, trust me, it's not about the style, it's about the fit. When you're out there on the dance floor, you don't want any restrictions, okay? Let's test these babies out one more time.
15533	Turk	Okay, ready? Five, six, seven, eight.And one, two, three, four, five six, seven, eight.
15534	J.D.	It _is_ hot!
15535	Turk	Put one hand on the floor!
15536	J.D.	I can't reach!
15537	Turk	You better feel the burn!
15538	J.D.	I can feel it burning!
15539	Tailor	Where I grew up, they didn't allow two men to marry.
15540	J.D.	Well, we grew up in ...
15541	Turk	Well, shoot, I grew up in the 'hood ...
15542	J.D.	...There you gotta do things like test suits out...
15543	Turk	...That's right.I'ma go change.
15544	J.D.	Uh.... I'm the best man. Do you have any advice for me to give my friend?
15545	Tailor	Just remind him over and over that the wedding is all about what the woman wants.
15546	J.D.	Yeah, I'll make sure and do that.
15547	Tailor	What did you have in mind?
15548	Priest	The ring, please?
15549	Turk	You got the ring?
15550	J.D.	It's got to be one of these!Oh, I've got ideas.
15551	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
15552	Carla	He's crashing. He needs to be intubated!
15553	Elliot	Dr. Cox!
15554	Dr. Cox	Oh, that's just dandy. I got a billion patients and no rooms, and I got Newbie pestering me for advice on how to be the best woman at Turtlehead's wedding, and I got a resident who can't do a simple procedure even though she learned it the first week she was here.
15555	Elliot	I'm sorry, Dr. Cox. I don't know what to do.
15556	Dr. Cox	I'll tell you what to do: Get the hell out of here.I swear to God, Carla, if one more annoying thing comes my way, please just go ahead and extract some of that extra air out of Barbie's head and inject it right into my veins!
15557	Dr. Kelso	Hey, ace! I want you to find my gardener, Hector, a room. He has a mild case of cellulitis, and I need him in tip-top shape by the weekend. I'm having my annual lawn-bowling tournament, and if anyone but Hector cuts my grass, my game goes to heck in a hand-basket.
15558	Dr. Cox	Dammit all, Bob, you know we don't have an extra bed in this dump!
15559	Dr. Kelso	Perry, what has two thumbs and still doesn't give a crap? Bob Kelso! I thought we'd met.
15560	Dr. Cox	Hector. Uh-heh. Cómo sea.
15561	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
15562	J.D.	Oh, man, this is amazing. I'm your best friend, now I'm your best man. What am I gonna be best at next?
15563	Turk	How about best at not talking?
15564	J.D.'s Thoughts	One one thousand, two one thousand.... And now I'm best at that!
15565	Janitor	Hey!
15566	J.D.	Me or him?
15567	Janitor	You.
15568	Turk	Cool.
15569	J.D.	What now?
15570	Janitor	Did you tell anybody about my epiphany toilet?
15571	J.D.	No, why?
15572	Janitor	Where're you coming from?
15573	Ted the Lawyer	Uhhh.......No...Hm?
15574	Janitor	If I find out you told anybody, I'm gonna beat you with poppy's old nickel sock.
15575	J.D.	First of all, why would I tell anyone? And secondly, no one has epiphanies on the john!
15576	Dr. Cox	Of course! It's so simple!Oh, Carla, good. Would you tell Hector here that he can stay just as long as he likes?
15577	Carla	Aye-aye, captain.Dice medigo...
15578	J.D.'s Narration	When two people collide, a lot of things can happen.
15579	Carla	...Okay?
15580	Dr. Kelso	What the hell is going on in here!?
15581	Dr. Cox	Oh, hey, Bob. Great news: we found Hector a room!
15582	J.D.'s Narration	For some it can be disaster.
15583	Elliot	I need help.
15584	Dr. Casey	Excuse me.Uh, buddy, can you not point that at me?
15585	Custodian	Sure.
15586	Dr. Casey	Hi. I'm Kevin.
15587	Elliot	I know!!! ...Um... I know.
15588	J.D.'s Narration	Still, the weirdest thing is when two people collide without ever being in the same room.
15589	Answering Machine	Hey, Turk, it's your brother. Good news! My business trip got canceled, so I can be your best man after all! I'm looking forward to it. Call me.
15590	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
15591	J.D.'s Narration	Sure I was hurt when I found out I was Turk's second choice for best man. But I'm not gonna be petty.... I mean, when the tux guy called to confirm Turk's measurements, I gave them to him.
15592	Turk	Dude! I look like I'm going to Ferrakhan day-camp!
15593	J.D.	Just paint your legs black, you'll be fine.
15594	Turk	Look at this lame-ass bow-tie and cummerbund, man!
15595	Tailor	Just remind him over and over that the wedding is all about what the woman wants.
15596	J.D.	You know what? You should totally say something. You know, unless you want to set a precedent where she's walking all over you for the rest of your life; but it's your call, you might love that, I don't know.
15597	Carla	I wanted those red cummerbunds because that's the theme!
15598	Turk	Red is a theme?
15599	Carla	Love is the theme! We're in love, you idiot!Just tell me why would you make such a big deal about something we both know you don't even care about?
15600	Turk	I don't know....
15601	J.D.	Well, I better get to work before all the good patients are taken.
15602	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
15603	Elliot	So tell me, is it harder being a surgeon or a doctor?
15604	Dr. Casey	Oh, definitely a surgeon. 'Cause when you tell people that a loved one died, you have to do that thing where you pull your surgical mask down and you shake your head. If you do it too fast, it says, you know, I knew he was gonna die. And if you take too long and pause with it, it gives 'em false hope. So you have to do it perfectly."Ahh, damn."
15605	Elliot	If one of my loved ones ever dies...I hope it's because of you.
15606	Dr. Casey	Hey, me too.
15607	Elliot	Are we, uh, flirting?
15608	Dr. Casey	A little bit.
15609	Elliot	Awesome!
15610	Dr. Casey	Have you seen the roof toilet?
15611	Elliot	No. But I'm a nervous pooer.
15612	Dr. Casey	Okay, now we're definitely not flirting.
15613	Elliot	Oh, it's just that I'm a little more comfortable with the setup that I have at home, you know. Like...extra locks.
15614	Dr. Casey	Yeah, I've only gone outside my house twice. Once on an airplane, and once at the White House.
15615	Elliot	How are the bathrooms at the White House?
15616	Dr. Casey	I have no idea, but the fountains are nice. And security? Quick as bunnies.
15617	Elliot	Listen, Dr. Casey, um, I know that you've helped out a lot of people, and I've got this, uh, intubating problem.
15618	Dr. Casey	I'll be right back.
15619	Elliot	Where are you going?
15620	Dr. Casey	To climb a mountain.
15621	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
15622	Dr. Kelso	This is completely unacceptable!
15623	Carla	Well, you said find him a room!
15624	Dr. Kelso	Not my office, dammit!
15625	Dr. Cox	He's your gardener, for God's sake!
15626	Dr. Kelso	I could have both of you suspended...
15627	Dr. Cox	You made your own bed, now your underpaid gardener's gotta sleep in it!
15628	Dr. Kelso	Fine! Get out of here! I'll get some paperwork done!
15629	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
15630	Janitor	Oh, man. Tell me you're not waiting to use my roof toilet!
15631	Nurse Roberts	Well, I would use Dr. Kelso's like I normally do, but I don't wanna wake up Hector.
15632	Janitor	Okay, look, attention roof-poopers! Setting aside for a moment the fact that I'm gonna make sure that you all live to regret this day, let's keep the magic rolling let's not tell anyone else that there's a toilet on the roof.There is not a toilet on the roof!
15633	Todd	But you just said there was.
15634	Janitor	No! Yes, I did, but I was using a metaphor...uhh...that means..."God is watching us." You've heard this, "There's a toilet on the roof."Right? People?
15635	Nurse Roberts	That's right, ain't nothing up there.
15636	Todd	Cool.

15639	Turk	J.D., can I talk to you?
15640	J.D.'s Thoughts	AGH!
15641	Turk	Have you seen Carla around?
15642	J.D.	Phew! False alarm.
15643	Turk	'Cause I need to, uh, talk to you in private? Sort of man to man?
15644	J.D.'s Thoughts	AGH!
15645	J.D.	I can't right now, Turk. I am completely swamped.
15646	Turk	You're drawing lightning bolts on your Nikes.
15647	J.D.	So I can get to my patients faster.
15648	Turk	How 'bout later?
15649	J.D.	Later's no good, dude. I gotta stop by the tux shop, then I gotta finish telling my whole family that you picked me as your best man!

15653	Elliot	Can't lick it, huh?
15654	Dr. Casey	Oh, God, no! I can't even sit on it.
15655	Elliot	Look, um, that problem I was talking about before.... I can't seem to intubate patients anymore. I mean, I used to do that better than anyone here. Now the only thing that sets me apart from the other doctors is that my beeper plays "That's the way, uh-huh, uh-huh, I like it! Mm-hm, mm-hmm!" I don't know what to do.
15656	Dr. Casey	It's just a piece of porcelain! I mean, there's no reason we both shouldn't be able to sit on it!
15657	Elliot	Yeah, um, about my career-ending problem....
15658	Dr. Casey	We must conquer the roof toilet.
15659	Elliot	ENOUGH ABOUT THE ROOF TOILET! Listen, all I've heard about from everyone is how amazing you are, and I'm not leaving here until you help me out!Dammit! I have to go.

15665	Carla	I'm sorry, Dr. Kelso, but I'm trying to get their lunch orders!
15666	Dr. Kelso	Oh, that reminds me. Hector, Enid made you a prosciutto and mozzarella sandwich, but I...uh...well, there was a misunderstanding and now it's gone.

15679	J.D.	Cool. I'll see you tomorrow.
15680	Dr. Casey	Uh, actually, no. I got a call I have to go back to my hospital.
15681	J.D.	Why? Why do you have to do that?
15682	Dr. Casey	Well, look at it this way: Uh, I may be leaving here, but I will always be there.
15683	J.D.	I know.
15684	Dr. Casey	I am so messing with you.
15685	J.D.	Ha, I know.... Okay. Well, sir, it was amazing to work with you.

15688	Dr. Casey	Okay.
15689	J.D.'s Narration	Watching Kevin go, I wondered how gay I looked giving that two-handed handshake. And also how weird it was that someone could just walk into your life, have such a big impact, and then vanish just like that, never to be seen again.But mostly I thought about how, in some small way, Kevin had helped every single person he met here.

15694	Elliot	Kevin left. Didn't even say goodbye.
15695	J.D.	Elliot, he didn't say goodbye to a lot of people. Just me, Dr. Cox, Carla, Doug, Snoop Dogg Intern...
15696	Snoop Dogg Intern	Where my hos at?
15697	J.D.	I haven't seen them.
15698	Elliot	Look, I don't wanna sound pathetic, but, he didn't even help me.
15699	J.D.	He didn't help a lot of people, Elliot. It was just me, and Turk, and Carla, and Dr. Cox, and Doug, and Dr. Mickhead
15700	Elliot	Mickhead? No, Mickhead's in rehab.
15701	J.D.	_Was_ in rehab, Elliot. Was. He'll never huff paint again.

15709	Dr. Cox	I know you do, sweetie, but here I'm plum out of hair scrunchies. Now scram, princess, we're waiting for somebody. Go on.
15710	Dr. Kelso	Hector's wife just set my drapes on fire with her damn prayer candle!
15711	Carla	He's here!
15712	Dr. Kelso	I want them both out of my office!
15713	Carla	Sir, there's a ton of empty beds right here. All you have to do is flick the switch.
15714	Dr. Cox	You know how to do that, don't you, Bob? You just bend over...and flick.Yeah, I thought so.
15715	Elliot	Who took this?
15716	Turk	With Marbury, I really believe New York has a shot at the title, man.
15717	J.D.	Yeah, me too.
15718	Turk	Which sport are we talking about?
15719	J.D.	I wanna say tennis....
15720	Turk	The only reason I asked my brother to be best man was because I knew he couldn't come to the wedding. But now his plans have changed and he's all excited. Dude, it has to be you, you know that.
15721	J.D.'s Thoughts	It's always uncomfortable when two guys wanna say something each other.
15722	J.D.	Look, you've been my best friend for ten years, man; I've loved you since college, and you know I'd do anything for you.
15723	Turk	Dude, look, man, you're my friend and I frickin' love you; and no one's looked out for me like you have.Cool.
15724	J.D.	Solid.You know, if it makes it easier, I guess we could be co-best men.
15725	Turk	You have no idea how much stress that would relieve.
15726	J.D.	...Even though...God said it's supposed to be one....
15727	Carla	You ever think there's more to Dr. Kelso than we know?
15728	Dr. Cox	Sure, is he in fact a latex-encased robot with real human hair and a circuit board where his heart should be? I can't...I can't rule that out.
15729	Carla	You know, Hector told me he's worked for Dr. Kelso for twenty years. That's half his life. I mean, I know he looks 50, but that's what being in the sun all day does to your skin.
15730	Dr. Cox	Right, right.
15731	Carla	The point is, it doesn't seem like he hates Dr. Kelso.
15732	Dr. Cox	Say...Say, Bobbo...Is it possible that you're occasionally a decent human being in your life outside of this place?
15733	Dr. Kelso	Well, champ, seeing as you don't exist in my life outside this place, I doubt it's any of your damn business.
15734	Paramedic	Go! Let's go, let's go!
15735	Elliot	Uh, hi. We don't have a helicopter pad
15736	Paramedic	We're out of time! He's losing oxygen, he needs to be intubated now!
15737	Elliot	Okay, just let me get someone.
15738	Paramedic	NOW! You! Let's go! Do it!Come on!
15739	Elliot	I'm in.
15740	Dr. Casey	You see, this is why I wanted you to use the bathroom up here.If there's something you know you can do, whether it's intubating a patient or...copping a squat on the roof, and your mind keeps throwing up roadblocks, just know you can drive right through 'em.
15741	J.D.	I can't believe it's gone.
15742	J.D.'s Narration	I think it's human nature to search for answers.
15743	Turk	Dude. Why is your tux gonna cost four thousand dollars?
15744	J.D.	No reason.
15745	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes the answer you get is the one you least expect.
15746	Dr. Kelso	All right, pipe down! Now, who's up for Dairy Queen?
15747	Hector & Family	Dairy Queen!
15748	J.D.'s Narration	But more often than not, the answers we've been looking for have been inside us all along.
15749	Dr. Cox	Well done, there, Barbie. You're now exactly where you were three years ago.
15750	J.D.'s Narration	I guess the important thing is to never stop searching.

15763	Elliot	Sean's coming back in a few weeks. What am I supposed to

15851	Carla	My fiancé would like to have his mole removed.
15852	Plastic Surgeon	That? That's cute. It's like a tickle button.
15853	Turk	No, it's not. It needs to go away.
15854	Plastic Surgeon	All right. I'll scrap it away and we'll cover it with skin from the

15949	Carla	Ahem. Sorry, sir. It's been an emotional couple of days.
15950	Kelso	I'm just here to, ah,
15951	Carla	I just wish I didn't hate that mole soThank you, sir.
15952	Turk	All right, I'm gonna get right down to it. You tell Carla that

15955	Turk	Ow!Don't sweat it.See ya!
15956	Plastic Surgeon	<Miffed at losing the 10 K) Great, an open surgery slot just gone to waste.
15957	Elliot	Not necessarily.Look at this.
15958	Plastic Surgeon	Waugh!
15959	Elliot	Oh.
15960	Cox	Those are the most ridiculous things I have ever seen.
15961	J.D.	You know, you're right. I was an idiot to buy these shower shorts. I mean, it's not like
15962	Cox	Look, I just want to say. That what happened. Wasn't your fault. And I'm
15963	J.D.	Thanks. I really needed to hear that.
15964	Ben	Good. Fun. Let's get dressed and go.
15965	Cox	Shower Shortz?
15966	J.D.	For the man who has nothing to hide. But still wants

15971	Turk	Can you tie my tie, Mrs. Espinosa?
15972	Turk's mole	Answer him!
15973	Turk	You just kissed my mole.
15974	Carla	Mmm-hmm.
15975	Cox	So how come you don't have to get all dressed up?
15976	Ben	I am dressed up. You see any holes in these pants?
15977	Cox	No.
15978	Ben	I'm glad you made it. Listen. There is one more thing you have to do for me.
15979	Cox	You can't keep me from getting drunk.
15980	Ben	You have to forgive yourself for everything that went down the other day.Yeah.
15981	Cox	Okay.
15982	Ben	Good.
15983	Cox	Now, where is your camera? Aren't, aren't you going to take some pictures?
15984	J.D.	Pictures of what?
15985	Cox	You know. Crying babies. Covered in chocolate. People singing

15989	J.D.'s Narration	It's been two weeks since Ben's death, and even though he was Jordan's brother, Dr. Cox was having a much harder time with it than she was.
15990	Jordan	Sweetie, are you gonna lie around on the couch all day again today?
15991	Dr. Cox	What am I supposed to do?
15992	Jordan	You know what might be fun? Cleaning yourself.
15993	Dr. Cox	I'd wash up, but I'm afraid to go in our bathroom.
15994	Jordan	Why?
15995	J.D.'s Narration	Jordan's best friends came to town for the funeral, and unfortunately for Dr. Cox, they still haven't left.
15996	Maddie	Since Perry won't stop using the loo without lifting the seat, I've started to use his sink.
15997	Jordan	Aren't you a little dolled up for the movies?
15998	Allison	If little miss co-dependent here doesn't get "shagged" every two days, she gets the shakes.
15999	Maddie	It's true. Look.
16000	Dr. Cox	'Course, that could be 'cause you're sober for a change.
16001	Maddie	Maybe!
16002	Dr. Cox	Mmm!
16003	Allison	You silly. Are you still mad because we tried to fix Jordan up with someone yesterday?Scary!
16004	Dr. Cox	Oh, God.
16005	J.D.'s Narration	Dr. Kelso was having a little female trouble of his own.
16006	Carla	Dr. Kelso, the sexual harassment around here has gotten out of control. Yesterday somebody asked Laverne if her boobs were made for walking! It's rude! ...And it makes no sense.
16007	Nurse Roberts	Paris and Nikki were not amused.
16008	Carla	You named your breasts after the Hilton sisters?
16009	Nurse Roberts	Other way around, sugar!
16010	Ted the Lawyer	Ladies, this hospital's policy on sexual harassment is well-established. Plus
16011	Dr. Kelso	I'll handle this. I think what Garfunkle here is trying to say is that you should all take a second, think seriously about what's really bothering you, and then have a big group unbunching of your panties.
16012	J.D.'s Narration	Every time Turk's in a hurry, I'm always tempted to jump out and scare him. Well, today's the day!
16013	J.D.	Booga! Booga! Booga! Booga!Wooo! Ack!
16014	J.D.'s Narration	The...reason Turk's in such a rush is because he's starting a rotation with the hospital's new attending surgeon.
16015	Dr. Miller	So.... You guys my new residents?
16016	J.D.'s Narration	I could tell what the guys were thinking.
16017	Dr. Miller	Oh! There's so much blood! I hope it doesn't get on my dress!I'm Dr. Miller. A few quick things: Don't talk while I'm talking, never utter the phrase "It's Miller time", and I don't like the smell of cologne in my operating room. Now, I'd like to take a minute to listen to any questions or comments that any of you might have, and then after this minute I never want to hear from any of you ever, ever, ever again. Anyone?
16018	Turk	Uh...I'm allergic to shellfish...?
16019	Dr. Miller	Any other allergies? No? Great! You, and unibrow, go scrub up.
16020	Turk	Wht?
16021	Todd	My waxer's in the Bahamas.
16022	Turk	Get a new one!

16024	Jordan	Okay, why don't you show the girls around while I'm in my board meeting.
16025	Dr. Cox	Love to. Newbie? I've got a job for you.
16026	Jordan	No, no. No pawning them off on Radar. They want the big-boy tour.
16027	Allison	Hey, I've been sharing a guest room with razor-knees, here, for the last two weeks. Do you have a queen bed?
16028	J.D.	Well, it would be "queen" if I took my "cwothes" off it.
16029	Maddie	Ooh, he's quick. What's he like in the sack?
16030	Jordan	Quicker.
16031	Allison	Oh.
16032	J.D.	May I be excused?
16033	Dr. Cox	You move, you die!
16034	Jordan	Be nice to my friends. Bye.
16035	Allison	Bye.
16036	Jordan	Bye.
16037	Dr. Cox	Okay! Here's the tour: This is where the patients enter, upstairs is where they go to die, and down in the basement is where we slide their cold, dead bodies into the wall. Oh, and that's the gift shop.
16038	Maddie	Where can one get a nice gin and tonic?
16039	J.D.	You know, down the street on the right, they'll make an appletini that'll knock your socks off.
16040	Maddie	Right! Let's go and get drunk before pilates!
16041	J.D.	So, uh, Jordan seems to be doing pretty well.
16042	Dr. Cox	You know Jordan, she is a rock.
16043	J.D.	How 'bout you? How you holding up?I...I know it's been kind of tough with Ben dying.Are you gonna talk ever?
16044	Dr. Cox	Let me go ahead and tee this up for you, there, Annika: We are all going to die someday. For the lucky few of us it'll be nice and fast. But for most of us it'll be just as long and slow and painful as a conversation with you.
16045	J.D.	That's a beautiful sentiment.

16048	Turk	Todd. Todd, let's get off on the right foot.
16049	Dr. Miller	Hey! It might just be 'cause my expectations are low, but you guys did not suck in surgery yesterday.
16050	Todd	Well, as long as your expectations are low, maybe we should have sex!
16051	Turk	Perfect.
16052	Dr. Miller	I'm concerned about you. I think you hold us women responsible for the fact that your mommy didn't pay attention to you, and if you don't get help, you'll eventually start picking up prostitutes and killing them.
16053	Elliot	I've always wanted to say that to him!
16054	Dr. Miller	Welp, now you don't have to! Ha-ha-ha!
16055	Todd	She just talked to me like I'm an idiot.

16060	Dr. Kelso	Nurse Espinosa, it's been brought to my attention that there's been some inappropriate behavior lately.
16061	Carla	I know. _I_ brought it to your attention.
16062	Dr. Kelso	Anyway, it occurred to me that we can't allow this to continue.
16063	Ted the Lawyer	It occurred to _you_ because _I_ researched case studies detailing the hospital's liability instead of going to single's night at the Korean church by my house!
16064	Dr. Kelso	Ted's sad life aside, I have decided that you are going to run a sexual harassment seminar.
16065	Carla	No one's gonna show up for that!
16066	Dr. Kelso	It isn't optional. Anyone gets more than three complaints here in the boxthen they have to attend.
16067	Janitor	Teddy!
16068	Subtitle	Teddy, we missed you last night.Shut up.
16069	Ted the Lawyer	What? He's baitin' me.

16071	J.D.	Seriously, how are you?
16072	Dr. Cox	Oh, my God. Look, Abby, I didn't write to you asking for help. So, if you continue on down this road, you're going to end up eating, breathing, and relieving yourself through a tube of some kind. Signed, Dealing With It On His Own in Kansas.
16073	J.D.	I wrote Dear Abby once in seventh grade 'cause I didn't have body hair like the other guys? By the time her response came out in Parade magazine, it was like a forest down there. Well, you know, "nothing ventured..."
16074	Dr. Cox	Looking for streamers and a and a marching band, because this will be the ceremonial one-millionth time I've had to shake off something that you've said.Ahh. Yes, Newbie, I'm having a tough day. And of course I'd love to head home, but Jordan's satanic brood has taken over my apartment and no man in his right mind would dare enter that place.
16075	J.D.'s Thoughts	Hmmm.... I should probably go to his place....

16077	Turk	Agility exercises?
16078	Todd	No. I'm air-fondling Dr. Miller's boobies. Who's with me?No? Eh.
16079	Turk	Why don't you lay off Dr. Miller? And don't say "I'd like to lay _on_ Dr. Miller."
16080	Todd	High-five later for reading my mind!
16081	Turk	You know, I don't think you're stupid, Todd.... Even though you're washing your hands with your gloves already on.
16082	Todd	Dammit!
16083	Turk	But keep your mouth shut, okay?It's hard for Dr. Miller being a female surgeon around here.
16084	Dr. Miller	All right. All those who are assisting me today, step forward.Uh-uh, not so fast, beer-bong. You're out.
16085	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16086	J.D.	Hello? The door was openOh, God! I'm sorry! I'm very sorry! I just came to to tell you both that I-I think it would be better for Dr. Cox emotionally if if you two would would leave. Okay? Thank you.
16087	Maddie	Just a second, darling.
16088	J.D.	Uhhh, um.
16089	Maddie	Of course, we will leave, but before we go, Allie could really use a man's opinion.
16090	Allison	Does this bra make my boobs look real?
16091	J.D.	Ohh, yes.
16092	Allison	Damn. Let's switch.
16093	J.D.	No, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no switchies. I think we should all be happy with the bras God gave us! I really should go.
16094	Maddie	Oh, it's all right. We were going to go to the gym, but I could just as easily throw up instead.
16095	Allison	Or you could just give us a work-out right here.
16096	J.D.	Uhh....I guess I could hang for a smidge.
16097	Maddie	Good. 'Cause we've got something to tell you. Right, Allie?
16098	Allison	How dare you tell us to leave our best friend's house because you want to kiss Perry's ass.
16099	J.D.	You know...ladies...I'm not usually into the rough stuff, but.... Oooooh.You shall not feast on me!

16105	Carla	Oh! Dr. Kelso, you have five.
16106	Dr. Kelso	Oh, I know! I put those in myself to prove a point. If you'll notice, all the "Kelso"s are written with a lower-case "K".

16114	Turk	Anybody gives you any trouble, and I'll handle the guy.
16115	Dr. Miller	'Cause, uh, little ol' me can't.
16116	Turk	Well, I didn't mean it that way.
16117	Dr. Miller	You know what's worse than the basic knuckle-dragging scalpel jocks I usually work with? You. You are the worst kind of sexist. You're one of the sneaky ones who prides himself on saying all the right things when, deep down, what you really think is that I'm just a little girl who needs protecting.
16118	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes it seems like men and women speak a completely different language.

16132	Turk	Dr. Miller accused me of being sexist. Me! I'm marrying Carla who do you think wears the pants? And the shirts...and the shoes...and sometimes my underwear.
16133	Elliot	Really?
16134	Turk	I said nothing.
16135	Nurse Roberts	Mr. Roberts likes to wear my brassieres.
16136	Elliot	Hm?
16137	Turk	Elliot, this woman doesn't like me. It could keep me from becoming the youngest chief of surgery in history, which could keep me from curing paralysis, which could keep me from having my birthday be a national holiday! And everyone knows I hate to work on my birthday!
16138	Dr. Cox	May I ask you something, there, Judy? Do you have any idea what it's like to have three angry, under-fed women tear you several new ones for a full hour?
16139	J.D.	Actually, yes. I caught the matinee of that show; definitely not for the whole family.
16140	Dr. Cox	Then for the last time, don't stick any part of your hairless body into my business. Trust me, there is nothing for you to gain from it. Because even if you went on a cruise to the most remote regions of the ocean and rescued my drowning, salt-soaked body in time to pump the sea water out of my lungs and bring me back from the brink of death, I would STILL be upset that the first face I saw was yours!
16141	J.D.	Well, you wouldn't see my face because it would be buried in your chest, giving you the hug you've been afraid to ask for your whole life!
16142	Dr. Cox	Huh!
16143	J.D.	Now, if you don't want my help, then fine, I'll back off.... But only because I feel a little bit guilty.
16144	Dr. Cox	About what?Uh?
16145	Ted the Lawyer	Dr. Cox, you received four complaints about calling male residents by girl's names.

16149	Carla	Did I say any of you boys could talk? No, I did not.Now, this part is especially important, so I need everyone's full attention.

16153	Elliot	Dr. Miller, hi!
16154	Dr. Miller	Thanks! My patient just died, but if I'm looking good, I'm psyched!
16155	Elliot	No, no. It's just that you work in a very tough specialty, and you manage to maintain your femininity and I find that very...um...sexy.
16156	Dr. Miller	Are you asking me out on a date?
16157	Elliot	Please! We just met! ...Not that it would make a difference if we hadn't...um....
16158	Dr. Miller	Uggh.
16159	Elliot	and he is not a sexist. And I know sexist. I mean, when my dad's not asking the maid for a neck-rub, he's telling me if I'm going to get emotional, I should do it in a closet because no one likes to see a hysterical woman.
16160	Dr. Miller	There's a closet right there!
16161	Elliot	I know, it's one of my favorites....
16162	Dr. Miller	Dr. Reid! I've seen you strutting around this place with your can-do attitude, and I know that you think because you're a female doctor, you're part of the solution. But you're not. Everything about you screams, "What does the cutie in Radiology think about me?" And yes, your friend Dr. Turk, he may ask you relationship advice or where to get his unfortunate girlfriend some naughty lingerie because we both know that when it comes to gifts, women all crave a nice leather push-up bra with tassels that go around and around and around like this but still, I ask you, is that _respect_?Uh, don't answer. I don't care!

16171	J.D.	Well, uh....
16172	Dr. Cox	Spill.
16173	J.D.	Dr. Cox had nothing to do with me going to see your scary friends. I did it all on my own.
16174	Jordan	I love how adult our relationship is!
16175	Dr. Cox	Fine. You want some straight shootin'? I'm glad that you're dealing with Ben's death so well. The fact is I'm strugglin'. And having those two harpies nesting in our home is not helping. For the life of me, Jordan, I cannot figure out why they're still here. It is beyond me!
16176	J.D.	You okay?
16177	Jordan	Why don't you grow a pair, Sally!

16180	Turk	Well?
16181	Elliot	I hate to quote my mother, but Dr. Miller is so uptight she could use a pitcher of martinis and an afternoon on top of a smooth-chested pool-boy.
16182	Turk	I knew you'd hate her.
16183	Elliot	I love her! Turk, do you know what I would give to have a female attending like her pushing me not to let the fact that I'm a woman hold me back? I mean...you have no idea how hard it is.
16184	Turk	_I_ have no idea?
16185	Elliot	Look, I'm not gonna fight about whether in medicine it's harder being black or a woman.
16186	Turk	Black!
16187	Elliot	Woman!
16188	Turk	Much prop, Dr. Rhodes.
16189	Elliot	Mm.

16193	Carla	Nooooooo, Todd. The term "melons" _is_ just as bad as "sweater meat."
16194	Todd	Well then I am thoroughly confused!
16195	Carla	This is a total waste of time!
16196	Dr. Cox	And do you know why it's a total waste of time?Well, now, take Bobbo, here. He's just a product of a different era!
16197	Dr. Kelso	Foxy, Enid!
16198	Enid	Oh!
16199	Dr. Kelso	Hot mama.Those were the days.
16200	Dr. Cox	And...this one. God save me, I can't even imagine what that upbringing must have been like.
16201	Todd's Dad	Boy, I'd like to take a swig out of her jugs.Hey, I'm talking, numb-nuts!
16202	Todd	Dad! I'm listening to 'Annie'!It _is_ a hard-knock life.
16203	Dr. Cox	My point is that in this tight-ass PC culture, it is damn hard to know what's kosher!
16204	Carla	Well, then you should try stepping into our shoes! Even the strongest women walk around with this thick coat of armor all day long, because God forbid we should show the slightest sign of weakness. So just squeeze those smelly, oversized feet into the shoes of someone you really care about; and trust me, in a heartbeat you will know the right thing to do.
16205	J.D.'s Narration	At that moment, Dr. Cox knew why Jordan's friends were still around.
16206	Jordan	Oh, would you turn off the lights? The baby doesn't know I'm here.Doesn't matter. Likes the nanny better than me anyway.
16207	Dr. Cox	Me too.
16208	Jordan	I miss Ben.
16209	Dr. Cox	Me too. God, me too.
16210	Turk	You want me to help you move that table?Not that you can't move it!
16211	Dr. Miller	What do you want, Dr. Turk?
16212	Turk	I was just thinking about...you know, what you were saying when I said that thing, and
16213	Dr. Miller	Just say it.
16214	Turk	...I'm sorry.
16215	Dr. Miller	Scrub up.
16216	Turk	So we're cool?
16217	Dr. Miller	-Ish. But you're a decent surgeon, and uh, I'm not one to be petty. So why don't we put on a little music?
16218	Turk	Yes. Why don't we.
16219	J.D.'s Narration	There will always be a battle for power between the sexes.Sometimes a man just has to give in.
16220	Todd	Gotta grab those.
16221	Dr. Kelso	No!
16222	Staffer	Ugh!
16223	Dr. Kelso	Remember, we look...but we don't touch.
16224	Todd	Okay.
16225	J.D.'s Narration	Other times it's enough just to take a positive step.And once in a while, even it seems cliché, a man just has to be there for her.

16230	Dr. Cox	Look, Carol, I know you think you look dashing in your navy blue scrubs, but I can't deal with the fact that I walk into the front door of this place and I find you standing there taaaalking at me.
16231	J.D.	All I said was "good morning".
16232	Dr. Cox	Exactly! And who in God's name wants to hear that every day?! "Good morning." In the immortal words of Daffy Duck: I demand that you shoot me now.If only.
16233	J.D.'s Narration	I couldn't help but think two things. First, I do look stunning in these navy scrubs I mean, come on, who wants a taste? Second, everyone's day begins differently around here.The surgeons for instance are the most superstitious bunch. So they always start their mornings with an oddly homo-erotic ass slap...
16234	Turk	Dude! Too deep!
16235	J.D.'s Narration	...and then their own personal good luck rituals.
16236	Turk	Ohhh, where's my lucky Tabasco 'do-rag!?
16237	J.D.	Why don't you just use Power Rangers?
16238	Turk	How are Power Rangers as lucky as Tabasco?
16239	J.D.	You remember when communications with Zordon went down and the Megazord was destroyed?
16240	Turk	How did I miss that episode? Ohh, that's right I was making love to a woman.
16241	J.D.	Power Rangers, hoooaaa!
16242	J.D.'s Narration	All you can really hope is that nothing bites you on the ass.
16243	Elliot	Gaby, you all set for your bone marrow transplant today?
16244	Gaby	I'm scared. I wanted to bring my stuffed pink doggie with me, but Mean Nurse says I can't.
16245	Elliot	Well, I promise you you'll have it.Honestly, _Mean Nurse_, why would you say that?
16246	Carla	Because she lost her stuffed pink doggie two days ago.
16247	Elliot	Frick!
16248	Turk	Since I been wearing that Tabasco 'do-rag, my surgery record's like 23 and 0.
16249	J.D.	Are you counting the boil you lanced yesterday?
16250	Turk	Question: Did he die? Answer: No, he did not. The point is, I gotta stick with whatever's hot. Like last month, it was not wearing any underwear.
16251	J.D.	So why don't you just take off your underwear?
16252	Todd	That's what I keep telling him!
16253	J.D.	Todd knows about the underwear thing?
16254	Turk	No.
16255	Todd	Oh, yeah.
16256	Turk	Look, the 'do-rag still has the juice, okay? I mean, can you imagine what could happen without it?I can't find any kind of obstruction!
16257	Dr. Wen	Keep looking. It must be there!
16258	Turk	I felt it!
16259	J.D.	Powerful, tiny fists....
16260	Turk	Hm!
16261	J.D.	He's back.
16262	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16263	J.D.'s Narration	Some people say everything comes down to luck....
16264	Turk	I need my lucky 'do-rag!
16265	J.D.'s Narration	What I believe is that the most minor event even a butterfly flapping its wings can affect everything.
16266	Turk	Hillside landing.
16267	J.D.'s Narration	Because once that seemingly insignificant event happens....
16268	Carla	What is wrong with you!?
16269	Turk	Baby, I wasn't looking at her lovelies. Okay? I was looking at the butterfly that just happened to _land_ on her lovelies. And who could blame it? There they are, all snuggly and safe and whatnot....
16270	J.D.'s Narration	...It sets everything else in motion.
16271	J.D.	Uncomfortable!
16272	Janitor	Okay, who do I kill?
16273	J.D.	She did it!
16274	Janitor	Man, I don't wanna clean this up!
16275	Nurse Roberts	Well, then, I think you picked the wrong day to be the janitor.
16276	Turk	Oh!
16277	Elliot	Janitor? Could you help me find a little girl's pink stuffed doggie?
16278	Janitor	I would love to, Darlin', but I'm a little bit busy right now.
16279	J.D.'s Narration	And insignificant events can lead to significant events.Like me being on time and Dr. Cox being late for a change.
16280	Dr. Kelso	Where the hell is Dr. Cox? His shift started four minutes ago!
16281	J.D.'s Thoughts	Uh-oh. You've gotta cover for him.
16282	J.D.	Have to learn to play the banjo.
16283	Dr. Kelso	Dammit, son, are you listening to me?
16284	J.D.	Yes, sir!
16285	J.D.'s Thoughts	And _buy_ a banjo.
16286	Dr. Cox	Hey, fellas. What'd I miss?
16287	J.D.'s Thoughts	And here he is!
16288	Dr. Cox	Goodness gracious. Suddenly I'm getting the most intense headache.Better. Worse. Better. Worse. I could do this all day!
16289	Dr. Kelso	You know, Perry, since Dr. Dorian was on time and you were busy in the break room coming up with that hilarious "better-worse" bit, maybe you should answer to him all day.
16290	J.D.	Uh, Dr. Kelso? That's my pen.
16291	Dr. Cox	Nice grab.
16292	J.D.	Well, I'm a lefty.
16293	Dr. Cox	You know, my head's probably going to melt when I say this but Kelso's idea wasn't half bad. Letting you run this place for a day would be a great educational experience. And, come on, let's face facts the training bra's got to come off eventually. So, it's your show, Debbie. Is this moment just the way you always pictured it?
16294	J.D.	It's your show, Debbie. Is this moment just like you always pictured?Stupid homemade dolls....It's a little bigger...?
16295	Dr. Cox	Ehhhhh.
16296	Carla	Turk, I just got off of a 12-hour shift. I'm starving and I have yet to take a single bathroom break which, by the way, is why I'm dancing a little and you want me to run home, search through your nasties, and bring back your lucky 'do-rag?
16297	Turk	And if you could be back in twenty minutes that'd be great.
16298	Dr. Kelso	Nurse Espinosa, your shift ended nine minutes ago. How is it that your time card isn't punched out?
16299	Carla	Well, sir, I
16300	Turk	Dr. Kelso, how is it that you had an ambulance take you to your dinner reservation last night just so you wouldn't lose it?
16301	Dr. Kelso	How do you know that?
16302	Turk	Because I'm the "homeboy" you screamed at to get my "ghettomobile" off the road.
16303	Carla	Turk! I don't need you to fight my battles for me. It makes me look like I can't defend myself!
16304	Turk	You're absolutely right, baby. And I apologize! Remember! 'Do-rag!
16305	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16306	Carla	Huh!Hello?
16307	Elliot	Hey, it's Elliot. What are you doing?
16308	Carla	Nothing disgusting.
16309	Elliot	I can't find that girl's little pink doggie anywhere.
16310	Todd	I got a pink doggie for you but it is not little.
16311	Elliot	Look, if you show me your penis, I'm gonna take it away from you.
16312	Todd	Cool.
16313	Elliot	Yeah, that was Todd.
16314	Carla	Don't worry about the doggie. I'll be right there.
16315	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16316	Mr. Strauss	Basically, I've had nausea and stomach pains for a couple of days now.
16317	J.D.	Mr. Strauss, I don't wanna tell you how to live your life, but maybe you should avoid eating sushi from the Gas 'n' Go.
16318	Patient	It came free with the fill-up! What am I supposed to do, just throw it away?
16319	Dr. Cox	Yes. Yes, you are. Fortunately, though, your vitals are normal, so we'll check back with you in a little while.
16320	J.D.	Sounds to me like a G.I. bleed.
16321	Dr. Cox	Sounds to me like angina.
16322	J.D.'s Thoughts	Come on...you can do this. Navy scrubs! Navy scrubs! Navy scrubs!
16323	J.D.	Hhhheeeere's the deal, Eleanor: We're gonna go ahead and get a full work-up on this guy. So, while I drop an NG tube and do a gastric lavage, why don't you go ahead and get an order on EKG with cardio biomarkers. If you need to know where those are, they're on page 37 of the Ann Taylor catalog right next to that salmon cable-knit sweater you've wanted for so long but haven't had the courage to order...'cause you're worried the weave's so thin, your nipples might just go ahead and peek their little pink selves through. Isn't that right, Dr. Cox....Dr. Cox...
16324	Dr. Cox	Oh, I-I-I'm sorry. Here I was in my own little world, talking to myself and dreaming about candy bracelets.
16325	J.D.	I don't like candy bracelets.
16326	J.D.'s Thoughts	I love them!Now you gotta grab that elevator. But not without giving him his patented shoulder bump!
16327	J.D.	Good day.OW!How you like me now?
16328	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16329	J.D.	Hey, you find your pink doggie yet?
16330	Elliot	Nope. But I had the pleasure of meeting Helen, the laundry room lady.
16331	J.D.	Oh, I think I know her! Does she have blonde hair?
16332	Elliot	No.
16333	J.D.	Brown hair?
16334	Elliot	Y-nuh-uh.
16335	J.D.	No hair!
16336	Elliot	That's the one.
16337	J.D.	Yeah, that's from the dryers.Hey! You know, the janitor's still downstairs. Why don't we just check his custodial closet?
16338	Custodian	Hey. You're not welcome here.
16339	Randall	'Sup.
16340	J.D.	Randall?!
16341	Randall	Just got the job, brah.
16342	J.D.	So that's why he's been back in my dreams....
16343	Custodian	Beat it.
16344	J.D.	Gotta go.
16345	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16346	Turk	Did you bring my lucky 'do-rag?
16347	Carla	Why don't you wear the fluffy puppies 'do-rag that I got you for Lent?
16348	Turk	Baby, I hate to tell you this, but the fluffy puppies? They killed like three people they banned from the O.R.
16349	Carla	Well, what do you want me to do, Turk? I forgot!
16350	Turk	You forgot. You never pay attention to the little things that are important to me.
16351	J.D.'s Narration	You'd be surprised how when one thing goes wrong around here, everything seems to go wrong.
16352	J.D.	What happened?
16353	Dr. Cox	Vitals are tanking!
16354	Nurse Roberts	No pulse in lower extremities.
16355	J.D.	I don't get it, he wasn't showing any signs of distress!
16356	Dr. Cox	Come on, come on, come on! We gotta make a decision here.
16357	J.D.	Uh...let's get him a CT angiogram stat.
16358	Dr. Cox	Good.It's an aortic dissection. It's bad.
16359	J.D.	Call surgery. Tell 'em we're on our way.
16360	J.D.'s Narration	In a hospital, it's hard to avoid letting people down.Whether it's someone you made a promise to...
16361	Gaby	I want my doggie!
16362	Elliot	I'm so sorry.
16363	Dr. Cox	Let's go, Gandhi! You're on!
16364	J.D.'s Narration	...or someone you love...
16365	Turk	I gotta go.
16366	Carla	Turk, I'm sorry!
16367	J.D.'s Narration	...or even letting down someone you barely knew at all.In the end, it's the "what ifs" that hurt the most. Like, what if things had gone a little differently?
16368	Dr. Cox	Lookit, it's just that aortic dissections are a doctor's worst nightmare. If you don't catch 'em early, there's about a ninety percent mortality rate. I mean, honestly, unless your patient was lucky enough to trip and fall into a CAT-scan machine, he wasn't gonna have a happy ending. Newbie, we didn't have a chance on this one.
16369	J.D.'s Narration	Me, I don't believe in fate. I believe we have more control than we think, and that every action has a reaction. After all....The most minor event even a butterfly flapping its wings can change everything. Sometimes for the better. Even if it doesn't seem like it at first.
16370	Turk	Look away.
16371	J.D.	I can't.
16372	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16373	J.D.'s Narration	It's funny how a seemingly insignificant event can set everything else in motion.
16374	Turk	Hillside landing.
16375	Carla	What is wrong with you? I can't believe you're looking at that guy's cleavage while Suzy Big-Rack over there is sitting there busting out of her niece's tank top.
16376	Turk	How the hell did I miss that?
16377	Carla	Damn, you're whipped.
16378	Turk	Uh-uh!
16379	Carla	Kssshhh!
16380	J.D.	Mmmm! Orange Goo Goo!
16381	Nurse Roberts	Ain't nothing here for you, mooch!
16382	Janitor	All done.
16383	Elliot	Janitor, could you help me look for a little girl's pink stuffed doggie?
16384	Janitor	I would love to. I'll meet you upstairs in ten minutes.
16385	Elliot	You are like...the sweetest guy!
16386	Janitor	I'm blushing.
16387	J.D.	Heh. So charming. Could you be half as nice to me as you are to her?
16388	Janitor	You are right. We need a fresh start. Come on.
16389	J.D.	Fresh start.
16390	Janitor	Mm-hmm.I think we need a longer fresh start.
16391	J.D.	How long do ya...suppose this'll be?
16392	Janitor	Probably ten minutes.Ease into it. Let's mix it up let's saw some wood. There we go. Nice. Very good.
16393	J.D.'s Narration	And insignificant events can lead to significant events.Like me being late because I was in the world's longest handshake.
16394	J.D.	Sorry I'm late. What'd I miss?
16395	Dr. Cox	Take a wild guess.
16396	J.D.'s Thoughts	I should get Turk a washboard!
16397	Dr. Kelso	Son, do you think I got to be chief of medicine by being late?
16398	Dr. Cox	Nooo, Bobbo! You got there by back-stabbing and ass-kissing.
16399	Dr. Kelso	Maybe so, but I started those things promptly at 8.
16400	J.D.	Uh, Dr. Kelso? That's my pen.
16401	Dr. Cox	Nice grab.
16402	J.D.	I'm a righty.
16403	Dr. Cox	Ehhhhh.
16404	Carla	...You want me to go all the way home and search through your nasties and bring back your lucky 'do-rag?
16405	Turk	And if you could be back in twenty minutes, that'd be great.
16406	Dr. Kelso	Nurse Espinosa, your shift ended nine minutes ago. How is it that your time card isn't punched out?
16407	Carla	Well, sir
16408	Dr. Kelso	Start punching out on time or I'll punch you out on time!I don't mean that violently, I was just trying to turn a phrase.
16409	Carla	Turk! Why didn't you stand up for me?
16410	Turk	Baby, you said I was too whipped.
16411	Carla	I need you to be more supportive.

16417	Janitor	No! Mark my words: We will find that little girl's stuffed animal.
16418	Elliot	You are really taking a personal interest in this!
16419	Little Janitor	Mommy! Where's my teddy bear?
16420	Janitor's Mom	Oh. I must have accidentally thrown it out when I was cleaning up.You know, this never would have happened if your room weren't so filthy.
16421	Janitor	Never again.

16425	Patient	Basically, I've had nausea and stomach pains for a couple of days now.

16429	J.D.	Sounds to me like a G.I. bleed.
16430	Dr. Cox	Look, Newbie, if you go ahead and leave this hospital knowing only one thing and God save me, it looks like there's a real chance that might happen please let this be that one thing: I'm in charge, and I don't care about your opinion. Now go get me a cup of coffee.
16431	J.D.'s Thoughts	Whatever. Just avoid the shoulder bump, catch the elevator, and make a great wise-ass remark before the doors close!
16432	J.D.	Hoohoo, hey, Dr. Cox, if you're so smart, maybe you should just...go ahead and be the...you're the kind of......Oh, dammit!I don't know what happened there. I'm usually quick and funny....
16433	Doctor #1	So I had this guy today presenting vomiting and abdominal pain? Two hours and one CT later, I tell him he's got ischemic bowel.
16434	Dr. Mickhead	Mm.
16435	J.D.	Have you ever noticed that words that rhyme with "bowel" are always bad? Like "scowl", "growl"..."movies with Andie MacDowell"....
16436	Dr. Mickhead	You're right, J.D. You are funny.
16437	J.D.	Stop.
16438	J.D.'s Thoughts	Ischemic bowel! That's it!

16453	Turk	You found it! Ha!
16454	Carla	'Course I did.
16455	Turk	See, that's what I love about you, baby. You always pick up on the little things that are important to me.
16456	Carla	Yeah, that's my job.
16457	Turk	Ah.
16458	J.D.'s Narration	You'd be surprised how when one thing goes right around here, everything seems to go right.
16459	J.D.	Look, Dr. Cox, I know my opinion doesn't mean anything and I'm always wrong and apparently useless which deep down you know isn't true because... ...shoot, I forgot your coffee. Anyway, I was thinking we should get a CT scan on Mr. Strauss, because he might have bowel ischemia.
16460	Dr. Cox	You know what, what the hell. It can't hurt. Let's get on it.
16461	J.D.	All right.It doesn't look like he's ischemic.
16462	Dr. Cox	No, Newbie, but that right there is the start of an aortic dissection, and dammit all if we didn't catch it early.
16463	Mr. Strauss	Is that good?
16464	Dr. Cox	That's very good. Laverne, will you call the O.R. and have it prepped?
16465	J.D.'s Narration	In a hospital, it's great when you get to come through for someone.
16466	Gaby	Thanks!
16467	Elliot	See you when you wake up.
16468	Dr. Cox	Will you be joining us, there, Gandhi?
16469	Carla	Good luck.
16470	Turk	Already got it.
16471	Dr. Wen	Clamp.
16472	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, it still doesn't always work out the way you'd hope.
16473	Dr. Wen	Rachel, clean up.
16474	J.D.'s Narration	In the end, you learn to treasure the times when things go your way.
16475	Elliot	So glad you're okay!
16476	J.D.'s Narration	And be there for the ones you love when they don't.And most importantly, you learn to accept that some things are out of your hands.
16477	Dr. Cox	Didn't matter when we caught it, Newbie. It was just his time.
16478	J.D.	Yeah....
16479	J.D.'s Narration	But still, with so much of life left up to chance, you can't help but look back and wonder.... What if things had been different...?
16480	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16481	Turk	Buddy, I get that you and Carla have been hanging out a lot, but pretending you're gonna steal her from me makes you seem sad, pathetic, and very lonely.
16482	J.D.	Your woman wants me so bad, we've developed our own little shorthand with each other.Mornin'!
16483	Carla	Morning!
16484	J.D.	That means "good morning"!
16485	Turk	Noted.
16486	Carla	Oooh.Come on!!!!
16487	J.D.	Enough beads! No more flashing.
16488	Carla	More beads, dammit! Come on!
16489	J.D.	Fine.
16490	Crowd	WOOOOOO!
16491	Carla	Yeah, baybee!
16492	Turk	Sounds pretty embarrassing.
16493	J.D.	Only because Jasper becomes an innie when he gets nervous....Still
16494	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, not all relationships are as solid as Carla's and mine.
16495	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Reid! Why are you using standard macrolides to treat your patient instead of Clovaritol?
16496	Dr. Cox	Ohh! Clovaritol is a drug? Now, honestly, Bob, here I was under the impression that it was a travel agency, what with all the free golf trips they've gone ahead and sent you on.
16497	Dr. Kelso	I'll have you know that I do not authorize any drug for this hospital that I haven't personally researched.
16498	Elliot	What did the research for Clovaritol say, sir?
16499	Dr. Kelso	"When life's not fair at all...use Clovaritol..."
16500	Dr. Cox	Check out Barbie bo-hody slamming big Bob! Atta girl!
16501	Elliot	Look, I have spent the last three years in this hospital getting pushed around because I'm "little Barbie from Connecticut!" But there is a new toy in town, and her name is Bitch-Slap Barbie! ...From...Connecticut.
16502	Dr. Cox	Still, let's remember that you can't even drive the doctor car without big daddy sitting right there beside you. Because you went ahead and accidentally gave the patient over in bed four macrolides and opiates two medications that I guarantee you are gonna make her nauseous.
16503	Elliot	My patient is fine. And I don't need you to
16504	Dr. Cox	I roughly think that would be the faint sound of your patient vomiting. You may be having trouble hearing it over the much louder sound of me being right yet again. Oooooh.God! My brilliance is now becoming a bit of a burden. Get back to me.
16505	Carla	I gotta give Mr. Ingram his meds so, latah!
16506	J.D.	Latah!That means "I'll be seeing you later."
16507	Turk	You want my fiancée? Just go ahead and take her, 'cause she's been nagging the crap outta me. "Pick up your socks. Wash your dishes. Stop whispering 'booya' to J.D. in the morning after we have sex."
16508	J.D.	How else am I supposed to know?
16509	Turk	I'm sayin'!
16510	J.D.	Ooooooh! That ass warrants the Batman sound effects loop!
16511	Turk	POW!
16512	J.D.	ZAP!
16513	Turk	BOPYOWoooooo.....
16514	Carla	Turk, how come every time I turn around you're checking out some woman's you-know-what?
16515	J.D.	Tushie parts?

16519	J.D.'s Narration	When you work in a hospital, you can count on an ever-changing roster of new faces. Whether it's the new flower lady who winks too much......or the plastic surgeon who's returned after spending three years fixing cleft palates in third world countries.
16520	Dr. Kelso	So, if any of you are interested in following in the philanthropic footsteps of Dr. Ramirez, he has graciously offered to answer any of your questions.I told you no one would care.
16521	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes a new face will just outright surprise you.
16522	Turk	What the hell are you doing?
16523	Roscoe Janitor	Me? Nothing, man. Just waiting for my brother to get off work. Maybe you know him! He's a janitor here? My name's Roscoe.
16524	Turk	Why is he doing that?
16525	J.D.	I think he gets bored.
16526	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16527	Carla	So I'm supposed to marry someone who can stare at women for the rest of my life?
16528	J.D.	Well, I wouldn't put it that way in your vows.
16529	Carla	Well, let's see how he likes it when I do it in front of him.Hey, honey!
16530	Turk	What's up, baby.
16531	Carla	Mm! Mm! MM!
16532	Turk	It's good, isn't it? That's because every time Estelle's working, she puts extra croutons into the stuffing.
16533	J.D.	And yet the salads always suffer....
16534	Carla	Excuse me. I am talking about that man's ass?
16535	Turk	Gotta go.
16536	Carla	You know, 'cause it's such a fine, chiseled, dig-your-fingernails-into-it kinda ass!
16537	Turk	Babe, he probably works out.
16538	Dr. Ramirez	Carla?
16539	Carla	Ron....
16540	Dr. Ramirez	Hey!
16541	Carla	Hi!
16542	J.D.	Kudos on the nice pooper.
16543	Dr. Ramirez	...Thank you...
16544	J.D.	Mine's firm, like mutton.
16545	Dr. Ramirez	Lovely.
16546	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16547	Elliot	Okay, Mr. Thompson, we've got your fever down, but how's the pain in your abdomen?
16548	Mr. Thompson	Practically gone.
16549	Elliot	Really? Huh!
16550	Mr. Thompson	Aaagh!
16551	Elliot	Heh. Little trick I picked up in med school.
16552	Mr. Thompson	Good trick!
16553	Elliot	Hm.
16554	Mr. Thompson	I think my insides exploded!
16555	Elliot	Now, I suspect you've got pancreatitis, so we're gonna run some LFTs and do an ultrasound, but in the meantime I am going to prescribe you something for your pain.
16556	Mr. Thompson	No, no, no, no, please. Please, don't sweat it. I'm used to the pain. Besides, my mom is bringing by the kids later, and I figure there should be at least one sober adult in the room.No, seriously, she's a drunk.
16557	Elliot	Ew, sorry. Heh.Oh, you!
16558	Mr. Thompson	Stop it.
16559	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16560	J.D.'s Narration	There's nothing worse than being around two people with a history.
16561	Ron	So did Sherry and Steve ever get married?
16562	Carla	You didn't hear what happened?
16563	J.D.'s Thoughts	Please say you heard.
16564	Dr. Ramirez	No, I didn't!
16565	J.D.'s Thoughts	Damn you, Ron!
16566	Carla	Steve took a year off to take care of his parents, and while he was gone, Sherry starting seeing Dr. Harding.
16567	J.D.'s Thoughts	Nooooo!
16568	Dr. Ramirez	Really!?
16569	Carla	Yes!
16570	Dr. Ramirez	Sherry and Gary?
16571	J.D.'s Thoughts	Nooooo!
16572	Carla	Yes!
16573	J.D.	Oh, thank God!You know, 'cause they...they both died doing what they loved.... Rafting.
16574	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16575	Elliot	So everybody treating you okay?
16576	Mr. Thompson	Yeah! You know, the nurse that does the sponge baths, I wouldn't be shocked if she's killed before.Heeey, sunshine!
16577	Nurse Roberts	Why don't you just calm your ass down? You was barely bleeding.
16578	Mr. Thompson	From a _bath_, woman!
16579	Nurse Roberts	Mmmm-hmmm.
16580	Elliot	I don't get it. I've run every single test; I cannot figure out why this guy is in so much pain.
16581	Dr. Cox	Did you run a D-U-H test?
16582	Elliot	What's a "D-U-H"?
16583	Dr. Cox	Uh, duuuuuh! The guy is a drug addict trying to score pain killers.
16584	Elliot	But he refused drugs.
16585	Dr. Cox	Mm! My bad! He is a very _clever_ drug addict. Look, I hate to question your three years of wisdom, but your pain guy is just like a million other drug addicts walking the hospitals every year with their aches, and their pains, and their spasms, and their cramps, and their myalgia, and their neuralgia, and their otalgia, and their every other -algia they can possibly think of just so they can get a fix.
16586	Elliot	Well, I believe in this guy.
16587	Dr. Cox	Would you like to go out on a limb? Sign him in, keep him overnight?
16588	Elliot	You know, Dr. Cox, you think that you have seen it all and done it all, but guess what? Heh. You haven't done me!
16589	Dr. Cox	Give her a second there, gang.
16590	Elliot	That didn't come out right.
16591	Dr. Cox	Go!
16592	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16593	J.D.	Yo, if you're captain out there today, pick me first, and then I'll be like, "Dude, we always play together!" Then you can pick who you really wanted to pick, but everyone else will think you wanted to pick me first.
16594	Turk	When do you think of this stuff?
16595	J.D.	Every minute of every day.
16596	Janitor	Hey, either of you guys see my twin brother?Hey, I asked you a question!
16597	Turk	You're better than this!
16598	Roscoe Janitor	Naghhey! Any sign of my brother? The janitor?
16599	Turk	Dude, there is no way that we'll ever, ever believe this one.
16600	Janitor	Could someone say "keep rockin'"?
16601	Roscoe Janitor	Argh!
16602	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16603	J.D.	Hey, Carla, after you check Mr. Ruck's IV in room 310, can you zip down to the cafeteria and flirt more with Dr. Hot Butt?
16604	Carla	Fine. So I was flirting with him a little. But...I used to have such a crush on the guy! And besides, you flirt sometimes. It's harmless, right?
16605	Woman	Can I press your button?
16606	J.D.	I don't know.... Can I press yours?Not always harmless.
16607	Dr. Ramirez	Hey! Uh, Carla.... I was, uh, wondering if...you wanted to grab dinner with me tonight.
16608	J.D.'s Narration	It's always a risk when you go out on a limb. Ultimately, you just make yourself vulnerable.
16609	Elliot	Laverne, did you pull up Mr. Thompson's old charts?
16610	Nurse Roberts	He was here like eight years ago complaining of the same abdominal pain, but as soon as he was given his pain medication, he went AMA.
16611	Elliot	What, he just took the drugs and bolted?
16612	Nurse Roberts	No.... He took some towels, too.
16613	Elliot	Frick!
16614	Dr. Ramirez	So what do you say?
16615	J.D.'s Narration	And you just hate to see anyone get crushed. ...Even Dr. Hot Butt.
16616	Carla	Sure! That sounds great!
16617	J.D.'s Thoughts	I'm sorry, what?
16618	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16619	J.D.	What the hell just happened?
16620	Carla	I don't know! He asked me out to dinner and I said yes! It just came out!
16621	J.D.	Shame!
16622	Carla	Look! Everyone thinks it's just guys who get all freaked out before the wedding, but it happens to women too!
16623	J.D.	"Ronnie"?
16624	Carla	"Ron." Ron he's not just some guy, J.D. He's my "what if?" guy. The one I always wondered about, the one I idealized, you know?
16625	J.D.	Now I want you to go.
16626	J.D.'s Thoughts	That she's a sorceress!
16627	Carla	Look, I would never do anything inappropriate.
16628	J.D.	Then you won't mind if I tell Turk!
16629	Carla	If you have to, go ahead. But! Then I'll know that we're not as close as I thought!
16630	J.D.	Damn beads....
16631	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16632	Elliot	Mr. Thompson, I was just taking a look at your old chart!
16633	Dr. Kelso	Yes! He was just telling me that the last time he was here his doctor couldn't diagnose him and just threw a bunch of pain killers at him instead!
16634	Elliot	He did?
16635	Mr. Thompson	I was so frustrated, I took off.
16636	Dr. Kelso	So this pain you're having is making you delusional.
16637	Mr. Thompson	No. Why?
16638	Dr. Kelso	No reason.
16639	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16640	Carla	Well, this is nice. After all these years, actually being out with you.
16641	Dr. Ramirez	Yeah.... So, where do you want to sit?
16642	Carla	How 'bout here?
16643	Waiter	We have a lovely selection of condoms.
16644	Carla	Ooh! Lemon zinger!
16645	J.D.	Uncool!
16646	Turk	What were you thinking about?
16647	J.D.	...What you'd look like if you were Chinese...?
16648	Turk	Me too!
16649	J.D.'s Thoughts	Hoo! That was lucky!
16650	Janitor	Hey, fellas! Guess what's on! A little show that I like to call Indisputable Evidence!
16651	Troy	Thank you, brothers, for inviting me to your twin birthday party!
16652	Janitor	No problem, Troy! Hey, brother! Why don't you enjoy this nice pen set that I got for ya! Check it out!Take your time! Approach it slowly!
16653	Roscoe Janitor	Hey! Wow! Thanks, bro! I'm definitely gonna use this to write to you when I finish my around the world travels. Put 'er there, man.All right! You do a good job around here!
16654	Janitor	And that, boys, is a brotherly handshake.
16655	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes around here you can't believe what you're seeing......Other times it's as clear as day.
16656	Elliot	Thanks.
16657	Dr. Cox	Ohhh, great! You're getting medication for your pain patient! But, say, why stop there? How's about we load up our fanny packs with happy pills, drive downtown, I'll hang out of the sun-roof, and we can just throw fistfuls of 'em right at drug addicts and it'll just be a big happy parade!
16658	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16659	Elliot	You know what's amazing about you? You have this unbelievable ability to make me doubt myself.
16660	Dr. Cox	I don't think I could possibly make you doubt yourself, ya rascal, unless you had the unnatural talent for being wrong most of the time.
16661	Elliot	Well, I'm not wrong. I just saw Mr. Thompson writhing in pain, and he had no idea that I was watching him. But you probably don't care about that, because you're more concerned with _being_ right than _doing_ what's right. Aren't you?
16662	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16663	J.D.'s Thoughts	Stay calm. Turk's never gonna find out about her date.
16664	Turk	Hey!
16665	J.D.'s Thoughts	AGGH!
16666	Turk	You got a minute to talk?
16667	J.D.	I got lots of time to talk. Do you wanna talk about anything? Anything? Hours to talk. We could talk about our feelings. Wh-what's up?
16668	Turk	Look, I been thinking about this whole Carla nagging me thing, right? And I know it's coming from a good place because, well, let's face it, the woman lives and dies for me.
16669	Carla	Mm.
16670	Dr. Ramirez	More wine?
16671	Carla	Oh, God! Yes!
16672	Turk	So I'm supposed to marry someone who's gonna bust my chops every time I look at a woman for the rest of my life?
16673	J.D.	Well, I wouldn't put it that way in your vows.... Hand me that?
16674	Turk	Here you go.
16675	Carla	So you and that girl Kelly finally broke up, huh?
16676	Dr. Ramirez	Yeah.... What was that cute name that you used to call her?
16677	Carla	Skunk-face! ...I was a little mean back then.
16678	Dr. Ramirez	Nahhh. I always used to think you were...the sweetest girl on earth.
16679	Turk	Nag! Nag! Nag! Nag! You see how Carla is lately. I mean, is that all I have to look forward to?
16680	J.D.	I hear they're coming out with a 'Stuart Little 3'.
16681	Turk	Nah, it's on hold. The director dropped out.
16682	J.D.	Turk, don't you have any work to do?
16683	Turk	Dude. Surgeon.
16684	J.D.	Beads, keep me strong!
16685	Turk	What?
16686	J.D.	Nothing.
16687	Carla	I'm so glad we did this!
16688	Dr. Ramirez	Oh, me too. You know, I have to leave for a lecture tour on Monday, but I'm back the last week in April, so maybe we can get together then.
16689	Carla	I'm getting married April 24th.
16690	Dr. Ramirez	So then our plans would totally interfere with your honeymoon.
16691	Carla	A little bit.
16692	Dr. Ramirez	Excited about it?
16693	Carla	I'm so excited.
16694	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16695	Elliot	Mr. Thompson, I have decided I'd like to prescribe you something for the pain.
16696	Mr. Thompson	Well, you know, that's your call.
16697	Elliot	There's just...one little problem.
16698	Mr. Thompson	Oh, my God! Just give me the drugs! 'Kay, lady? For God's sake, I've been working you from every possible angle: I refused pain killers; I did the "you're the greatest doctor!" bit, which I know you loved; then somewhere between, uh, getting a tube in my ass and a tube in my mouth which, by the way, I'm still praying wasn't the same tube I found time to do the whole "I'm writhing in pain but I don't know if you're watching me" thing! So please, or pretty please, or however you want me to say it, Doctor, why don't you say it! Why don't you say it! Why don't you tell me what the problem is, AND SAY IT!
16699	Elliot	Um.... I was just gonna say that my pen doesn't work, and I needed a new one to write out your dosage.
16700	Mr. Thompson	Oh. Awesome.
16701	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16702	Carla	I felt nothing for him! How cool is that!
16703	J.D.	I had a dream just like this...except I had a saddle on my back and you were an Indian. Turk was a donkey.
16704	Carla	I'm gonna go tell Turk.
16705	J.D.'s Thoughts	Awww, that's great. She's gonna go Wait, what?
16706	Carla	Whoooa!
16707	J.D.	Whatever you do, don't scream.
16708	Carla	Why would I scream?
16709	J.D.	I don't know. People always said that in the movies.
16710	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16711	Turk	You did what!?
16712	J.D.	Make that twenty years.
16713	Turk	Honey, that was a long time ago.
16714	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16715	Turk	Why are you still living here?
16716	J.D.	Because I've got nowhere else to go!Sorry.
16717	Carla	But still, what if I want to tell him?
16718	J.D.	Well, that's up to you, isn't it! Gotta go!
16719	Carla	Damn beads.
16720	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16721	Janitor	Yuk it up, I don't care. I'm getting the last laugh! 'Cause my brother's waiting for me downstairs, and when these elevator doors open, you'll see, he's gonna be staring right at you two guys.Okay, I don't know what I thought was gonna happen, but I think we can all agree that this isn't working out, it's costing me a tremendous amount of time and effort, so let's just call it a draw.
16722	Turk	Hell, no! You lost! Live with it!
16723	J.D.'s Narration	It's hard when you lose for the first time.It's even harder when it's the hundredth time.
16724	Dr. Cox	Say it.
16725	Elliot	You're always right.
16726	Dr. Cox	I know! But it is still so nice to hear it.
16727	Elliot	How did you know that he was lying?
16728	Dr. Cox	Well, you said that he wasn't; and as a rule, I always take whatever you say and just go in the exact opposite direction with it. But, more than that, Barbie, the main reason is because...well, lookit, medicine is all about experience. Hell, wouldja......wouldja like to go ahead and have a look at who the last doctor was to give Thompson drugs?
16729	Elliot	You?
16730	Dr. Cox	Oh!
16731	Elliot	Why didn't you say something earlier?
16732	Dr. Cox	What, give up my front-row seat to Barbie's Wild Ride? "He's a drug addict! He's not a drug addict! You make me doubt my self!"You're more interested in being right than doing what's right! And I just couldn't take it! Can't take it anymore!"
16733	J.D.'s Narration	And yet sometimes losing is a good thing.Like, for instance, when you lose your insecurities about the guy you're marrying, which makes it a whole lot easier to cut him some slack once in a while.
16734	Carla	Go ahead, look.
16735	Turk	Really, baby?
16736	Carla	Yeah. Besides, you're cutting up your napkin.
16737	J.D.'s Narration	I guess you can never underestimate how the smallest gesture can make everything better.
16738	J.D.	You know, for a minute there I actually thought you had a twin brother.
16739	Janitor	Really?
16740	J.D.	Mm.
16741	Janitor	Was it when my twin brother was here?
16742	J.D.	Stop it.
16743	Janitor	Sorry.Too much.
16744	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16745	J.D.'s Thoughts	Today's gonna be a great day. Still, no time to dilly-dally God, that's a fun phrase I have to meet Dr. Cox in five
16746	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16747	J.D.'s Thoughts	Good God! Check out those dilly-dallies! That may be the future Mrs.Okay, back to work. Because Dr. Cox has hand-selected me to help him on a research project.
16748	J.D.	Hey, research buddy!
16749	Dr. Cox	We're four seconds in and I'm already regretting my decision.
16750	J.D.	Things Jordan says during sex! Ha!
16751	Dr. Cox	Are those the charts I wanted?
16752	J.D.	Noooo. They're the charts you wanted, plus! patient history charts from the last ten years, which yours truly stayed up all night organizing not only chronologically but by severity of condition.There's a good chance I'm gonna kill someone.
16753	Dr. Cox	Things you say when you talk to your patients.
16754	J.D.	Clever.
16755	Dr. Cox	Ah, don't bother with that, Trish. You know, I've been getting my hair cut by my barber, Big Frank, for seventeen years now. Is it because his prices remained the same? No. Is it because I like the way his man-breasts feel gently resting on my shoulders when he does my sideburns? A little, yes. But, mainly, it's because, unlike you, he does just exactly what I tell him to do. You see, it's my way or the highway, and since you've already broken that dictum you're out!
16756	J.D.	No, but wait!I already got my shifts covered for the next two days! Besides, where're you gonna find somebody else? You think Lonnie, my intern, gives a rat's ass about acute thomrobotic thrombocytopenic purpura?
16757	Lonnie	ATTP? It killed my father.
16758	Dr. Cox	You're in.
16759	Lonnie	It is gonna be so amazing working on the disease that tore my family apart.
16760	J.D.	Kiss ass.
16761	J.D.'s Thoughts	I guess I could go home.... But there's plenty of important stuff I need to do around here.
16762	J.D.	Hey, Laverne. What'd you give me if I get this jelly bean into your cleavage?
16763	Nurse Roberts	A concussion.
16764	Elliot	Guys! Three long years of busting my hump at this place and it has finally paid off!
16765	J.D.	You got the fellowship?
16766	Elliot	No! I get to be the clown in Pediatrics!
16767	Carla	Heeeey! That old clown was really good. So, uh, you got some really big shoes to fill!Dammit, I'm funny!
16768	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16769	J.D.	YES! He hits it at the buzzer!

16775	J.D.	Dude, my tongue is totally dry. How many more of these wedding invites do I have to lick?
16776	Turk	Fine. Don't lick 'em.
16777	J.D.'s Thoughts	Come on, don't get mad at Turk. What's really bugging me is that, thanks to Dr. Cox, I've got nothing to do...nothing to talk about...no stories to tell.
16778	Turk's Thoughts	From the moment I woke up this morning, I have been freaking out about getting married. Luckily, Carla's being cool.
16779	Carla	Okay, this is your last chance to uninvite that slut you went out with in high school.
16780	Turk	She's married to my brother!
16781	Carla	Isn't that convenient.
16782	Turk's Thoughts	Thank God she thinks that hot chick, Tina, I invited is my cousin! Well guess what! There's no blood there, baby!
16783	Carla	Oh, and by the way, don't think for a second that your "cousin" Tina's gonna be sitting at our table.
16784	Turk's Thoughts	Oh, my God! She's in my head!Make me a grilled cheese sandwich, woman!
16785	Carla	Make it yourself.

16790	Turk	WHAOA!
16791	Carla	It's okay, sweetie, just drop them in here.
16792	Turk	I don' wanna.
16793	Carla	If you're nervous, come here and I'll tell you a secret that'll make you feel better.Come here. Come here.Give me those invitations! Give them to me! Give them to me!!

16795	Elliot	Sean, I'm just bummed that I'm so busy I might not be able to do this clown thing today. I know I'm a doctor first, but what about that summer I spent at clown academy? I mean, it's starting to seem like that was just a giant waste of time. I wish you were here. I can't believe you've been in New Zealand for 5 months.
16796	Sean	I can't believe you still haven't figured out the time difference. It's 4 A.M. here!
16797	Elliot	I'm sorry.... It's just I miss talking to you...I miss seeing you...I even miss that weird way you sleep with your eyes open.Sean? Sean!
16798	Turk's Thoughts	Daaaamn, Elliot's got a nice ass for a white chick!Oh, great, my new scary boss and her amazing chest, butt, feet.... I love feet.
16799	Dr. Miller	Dr. Turk! This is Bryan. You'll be assisting me on his tumor debulking this afternoon.
16800	Turk	Wussuuuuuuuup, Bry-Bry! You, my friend, have just won the lottery. I'm not saying I'm good, but if there was a surgeon awards show around here, it'd be called The Turkies. You know what I'm sayin'?
16801	Dr. Cox	You don't have to know what he's sayin' none of us do.
16802	Dr. Miller	Mmmm....may I have a quick moment?Mm, excuse us.
16803	Turk's Thoughts	What now, you mean witch?
16804	Dr. Miller	I'm sorry, but if you act like a cartoon character in front of one of our patients again, I'm gonna spend the next ten years introducing you as the guy who sponges off my forehead.Bryan! Dr. Turk is gonna take you back to your room.
16805	Dr. Cox	That was...that was glorious.
16806	Dr. Miller	Okay.
16807	Turk	You didn't mind that cocky stuff, did ya?
16808	Bryan	Noooo. I love "Bry-Bry". Never had a nickname before.
16809	Turk	Well, lemme tell you something there's plenty more where that came from, Killer B!

16811	Elliot	What are you doing here? I thought you had like two days off?
16812	J.D.	Had to pick up a mouth guard from oral surgery. Some of the kids at the park said I couldn't jump Jones Creek on my bicycle; so now I gotta give 'em the 4-1-1 on my mad daredevilin' skills!
16813	Elliot	Meanwhile, back in adult world.... I was just given twelve new admits and now there's no way that I can be a clown for the kids today!
16814	J.D.	Ooh, you know, if it helps, I could I could examine her...for you. Elliot, please!Ow! It hurt through my helmet!
16815	Elliot	Heh. Mrs. Bell, your EKG showed a slight irregularity, but nothing too serious.
16816	Mrs. Bell	Maybe when my husband hears that he'll stop worrying, go home and get some rest.
16817	Mr. Bell	Hey, honey?
16818	Elliot	Oh, and this must be your hobbit! I mean husband! Of course. Heh. I rented 'Lord of the Rings' last night, so.... I would do Frodo. ...He's short...too. Heh.

16820	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Miller! I am attending a hospital administrator's luncheon this afternoon. I would love for you to join me.
16821	Dr. Cox	Not so fast, there, Bob. You forgot to affix the warning label to your forehead. You know, the one that reads "Exposure to Bob Kelso can be hazardous to your health" thus affording the reader a fighting chance to escape the waste and contamination that is...Bob Kelso.
16822	Dr. Kelso	Gosh, darn it, Perry, you are entertaining. You know, like Howie Mandel or a monkey in a funny hat.
16823	Todd	Check out Cox and Kelso fighting over Dr. New Girl!
16824	Dr. Kelso	No, she's coming with me!
16825	Dr. Cox	I want her.
16826	Dr. Kelso	Too late for you.
16827	Dr. Cox	She's mine!
16828	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16829	Turk	She'll have to get one of those cars you drive with your feet!
16830	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Miller, I hope to see you later.
16831	Dr. Cox	Look, I like you...so here's some advice: Never, ever do anything with Bob Kelso. Don't talk to him, don't look at him, don't even associate with guys his age on the outside chance that they just shared a steam together in that never ending Klan meeting that they call a "country club"; right? He is...pure evil.
16832	Dr. Miller	I'll remember that. Not the crazy "where the hell is he going with this?" ranting, but you know, the gist the Bob Kelso-bad part.
16833	Dr. Cox	Fair enough.
16834	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16835	Turk	Nurse Espinosa, would you mind getting me some sugar, stat.
16836	Carla	Why, yes, Doctor.Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
16837	Bryan	Wow! This hospital rocks! Did you two just meet?
16838	Turk	No. We're getting married.
16839	Carla	Yep! The invitations went out today!
16840	Turk	Yes! You know they did, baby! Invitations went out _today_!No, they didn't!
16841	Bryan	I could never get a girl like that.
16842	Turk	Why?
16843	Bryan	Well, girls don't usually go for the piano-playing power geek.
16844	Turk	Are you a good pianist?
16845	Turk's Thoughts	"Pianist"! Heeheehee!
16846	Bryan	Yeah, I got a scholarship to Juilliard.
16847	Turk	Bry-Bry! You're in the money! Girl's love the artsy type you'll be getting more tail than you know what to do with.
16848	Bryan	Ohhh, okay.
16849	Turk	"Tail" is sex, Bryan.
16850	Bryan	Ohhh! Awesome!
16851	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16852	J.D.	Ow!
16853	Carla	Okay, okay, okay.
16854	J.D.	I don't know the exact distance in terms of feet and inches, but in laymen's terms, I would have to say...about halfway.
16855	Dr. Cox	Never stop peddling, Annie. You are a shoo-in for the Little Girl X-Games.
16856	Dr. Miller	Has anyone seen Dr. Kelso? We're supposed to leave for that luncheon.
16857	Dr. Cox	Oh, that's strange. Because I remember having a conversation with you about this very subject never do anything with him, pure evil ringing any bells?
16858	Dr. Miller	Just the one in my head that goes off when I'm incredibly bored.
16859	Dr. Kelso	Wow! Perry, people usually don't stop caring about what you have to say 'til after they've been here a few months! Oh, no he didn't!That's the correct use of that phrase, right?
16860	Dr. Miller	I don't know, sir.
16861	J.D.	Ow!
16862	Dr. Cox	Ah, ba da ba.
16863	J.D.	Owwww.
16864	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16865	Elliot	Awwwwwwwwww!Ummm.... Mrs. Bell, uh
16866	Mrs. Bell	How'd I end up with him?
16867	Elliot	Yes.See, I've got this boyfriend, except he's all the way in New Zealand and...well...how did you know that Mr. Bell was the right guy for you?
16868	Mrs. Bell	Kurt was the one that was always there for me. And at the end of the day, that's who you want the guy who shows up when you need him, without having to ask.
16869	J.D.	Dr. Reid couldn't be here today, children, so I'm here in her place.
16870	Kid	Why're your pants so tight? Clowns have baggy pants!
16871	J.D.	Well, Brad, I'm the type of clown that likes to wear tight pants.
16872	Kid	But the other clown has baggy pants!
16873	J.D.	What other clown?
16874	Janitor	Hello, old friend.
16875	J.D.	Janitor!
16876	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16877	Turk's Thoughts	Man, the way Dr. Miller stares makes me all itchy. What can I say to let her know I'm in control?
16878	Turk	Have you ever slept with a black man?
16879	Dr. Miller	Just finish the procedure please.
16880	Turk's Thoughts	That's a yes! And now her mind will drift back to that wonderful day. Wait for it.......And there it is.
16881	Turk	Dr. Miller, please, feel free to drift off. Although there is a lot of bleeding.
16882	Dr. Miller	You lacerated the brachial artery. Move out of the way!Look, you made a mistake. Every one of us has made a mistake. You should consider yourself lucky instead of losing his arm he'll just have some nerve damage and limited use of his right hand. It could have been a lot worse. If you want I'll even tell him for you.
16883	Turk	He's a concert pianist.
16884	Dr. Miller	Oh. You tell him.
16885	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16886	Turk's Thoughts	Okay, just go in there and get it over with.
16887	Turk	Heeeey! Bry-Bry! What's the happie-haps!
16888	Bryan	My hand is feeling really weird.
16889	Turk	Ummm, about that....
16890	Turk's Thoughts	"I made a mistake"! Just say it! I made a mistake!
16891	Turk	I'm not really too sure on the specifics, but uh...apparently there were some complications.
16892	Turk's Thoughts	Ah, ya big chicken.
16893	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16894	Dr. Cox	Well, now, you are looking slim. Are those new scrubs? Or is it the fact you no longer have a soul?
16895	Dr. Miller	What's your problem?
16896	Dr. Cox	Come on, the only reason Kelso wanted you at that dinner is because he knows standing next to a pretty doctor will get his picture in all the medical journals. Assuming his image actually shows up in photographs.
16897	Dr. Kelso	So what? Publicity is good for the hospital. Plus, pictures of us together lend credence to the rumors that you and I are having a fling.I'm joking! There are no rumors.The point is, Cox just wants you on his side, and until that happens he's gonna be all over you.
16898	Dr. Cox	Fine, maybe he's right.
16899	Dr. Miller	Please get out of here.
16900	Dr. Cox	Look, you're in with Kelso now, but trust me, he will turn on you the minute you say no to him on anything.
16901	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Miller! Would you care to accompany me to the proctology dinner tonight?
16902	Dr. Cox	Yeah! Wouldja!?
16903	Dr. Miller	Heh. I don't know yet.
16904	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16905	J.D.	Okay, kids, I've never made balloon animals before, but raise your hand if you like your eels!
16906	Janitor	You're a horrible clown.
16907	J.D.	Save it for the post-show, Lurch.I think what Angry, Disturbed Clown is trying to teach us is that it's never funny to push!
16908	Lonnie	Dr. Dorian?
16909	J.D.	Okay, let's take a little break, kids. Duck, Duck, Eel.
16910	Lonnie	Mr. Millican just died, and his family needs to be notified. Since I'm still kind of new at this, I was hoping you could do it.
16911	J.D.	So you steal my research project and now you want me to do your dirty work?
16912	Lonnie	Dr. Cox told me if you said that to say, "That's right, Melinda."
16913	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16914	Carla	Hey.
16915	Turk	Hey.
16916	Carla	How you doing?
16917	Turk	Babe, I've never screwed up a kid's life before.
16918	Carla	That watch is inside Mr. Conte? Well, thank God! All this time I thought you didn't like it!But we're talking about you. And you, honey, you did a courageous thing. You took responsibility for your actions. Right?
16919	Turk's Thoughts	No, I didn't.
16920	Turk	Yes I did.
16921	Carla	You're just upset because it's never easy to give someone bad news.
16922	J.D.	Unfortunately your grandfather's bowel burst, causing a severe sepsis. We were unable to save him. I'm so sorry.Again, I'm...I'm very sorry.
16923	Elliot	J.D., what are you doing?
16924	J.D.	Oh, just breaking some bad news...circus style.
16925	Elliot	You were a clown for me?
16926	Janitor	Break's over, Binky.
16927	J.D.	The show must go on.
16928	Turk's Thoughts	So I didn't tell him.... It's not like it would change anything.
16929	Carla	Christopher!
16930	Turk	"Christopher"? You only call me Christopher when you're mad...or when we're having sex. Baby, are you mad when we're having sex?
16931	Carla	Sometimes.Come. Let's take a walk.
16932	Turk's Thoughts	Oh, this is bad. Okay, what did I do? Think. I accidentally got her a present on my ex-girlfriend's birthday. I referred to that new cute nurse as a young Carla Espinosa damn, that was stupid. I've been known to leave my toenail clippings on her throw pillow. Oh, and I forgot to put the toilet seat down last night and she bruised her butt! Wow, why is she marrying me? Marrying me! Oh, God! She knows I haven't mailed the invites!
16933	Carla	I thought you might want to talk to Bryan before you went home.
16934	Turk	How'd you know?
16935	Carla	Who you talkin' to?Get in there.
16936	Turk	Okay.Bryan. Uh.... Look, I got a confession to make, man.
16937	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16938	Dr. Kelso	Ahh, there's my dinner buddy! Shall we head out?
16939	Dr. Miller	Oh, no, no, no. I'm not going. I have a date. And even if I didn't, I don't think I'd want to go to a snooze-fest with a bunch of drunk proctologists just so you could get your picture in the latest edition of Bend Over Weekly.
16940	Dr. Kelso	A simple "I'm busy" would have sufficed.
16941	Dr. Cox	Big boys don't cry, there, Bobbo.
16942	Dr. Miller	Why are you smiling?
16943	Dr. Cox	Oh, I don't know, I guess I'm just glad you wound up in my camp.
16944	Dr. Miller	Yeah, I'm an adult, I don't actually go to camp. Listen, if Dr. Kelso had asked me to go somewhere that I thought was actually good for my career, I'd be gone so fast you'd be left here staring at an imaginary woman's chest while she was trying to make a point.
16945	Dr. Cox	I'm I'm sorry, you're right, it's my fault. That dress just screams "respect me as a doctor." Heh.
16946	Dr. Miller	You try and paint Dr. Kelso as this jackass who turns on people who don't do his bidding, when you were ready to write me off just for having lunch. So honestly? How are you any different?
16947	Dr. Cox	I'm taller than he is?
16948	Dr. Miller	Hmm. Feel free to watch me leave.
16949	Turk's Thoughts	It's weird. Just by the simple act of pushing me to do the right thing, I remembered why Carla's the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with.End of story.
16950	J.D.	You did it!
16951	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, man, what a long day.Still, any day can be salvaged by drinking a few cold ones with a good friend.
16952	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16953	J.D.	Awesome. 'Judge Dredd' is starting.
16954	Elliot	Mm.You still have a little clown makeup on you!
16955	J.D.	Elliot, The Judge, please.
16956	Elliot	Fine, I'll get it.
16957	J.D.'s Thoughts	What the hell is she doing? It's The Judge!Oh.
16958	J.D.	I can't find the clasp.
16959	Elliot	What?
16960	J.D.	The clasp! The clasp!
16961	Elliot	I switched to frontsies!
16962	J.D.'s Thoughts	Naughty!
16963	Elliot	Position One, Two, or Three?
16964	J.D.	We only had two.
16965	Elliot	Oh, yeah. Well, I have something to show you later.
16966	J.D.'s Narration	It's a mystery how one woman can drive you crazy over and over again.While another can bring you right back down to earth.In the end, you have to trust that the perfect woman will always lead you in the right direction.
16967	Carla	So did you ever get the guts to mail the invitations?
16968	J.D.	Look, Elliot, I don't want to jinx this, but, how did that just happen?
16969	Elliot	You were a clown for me. You were there when I needed you without me even having to ask.
16970	J.D.	Sean?
16971	Elliot	Sean!?Oh, my God! When did you get back from New Zealand?
16972	Sean	Something in your voice told me that you needed me. So I just...I decided to show up, even though you didn't even ask.
16973	Elliot	Ohhh, Sean....
16974	Sean	Good to see ya, J.D.Hey! You switched to frontsies!
16975	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16976	J.D.'s Narration	I can't stop thinking about last night. I mean, it's incredible how fast things can go from amazing......to complete disaster.
16977	Sean	I have been looking all over for you!
16978	Elliot	What are you doing back from New Zealand?
16979	Turk	Morning.
16980	Carla	What's up with him?
16981	Turk	He slept with Elliot last night.
16982	Carla	Is it _that_ time of year again?
16983	Turk	Dude, ignore her. That's three years in a row who's feeling you?
16984	J.D.	You be.She's already back with Sean.
16985	Carla	How soon after you guys hooked up?
16986	J.D.	About ninety seconds.
16987	Turk	Oooooh.
16988	J.D.	What should I do?
16989	J.D.'s Narration	That was a huge mistake. Because the closer Turk and Carla got to their wedding, the more they became one of those annoying couples that thought they knew everything about relationships.
16990	Turk	You first, honey.
16991	Carla	J.D., love is like a butterfly. Hold it too tight and...you'll crush it.
16992	Turk	Too loose and it flies away.
16993	Carla	Mmm.
16994	J.D.'s Narration	The phone call was Elliot asking me to meet her so we could talk.
16995	J.D.	Irrrrrv!
16996	Irv	Howdy, Dr. Dorian.I'm sorry, sir. But there's no parking allowed at the emergency curb. But I'd be happy to park your car for ya, and run the keys up to you in a jiff.
16997	Guy	Yeah.... Except this is my only set? And I'm afraid you might eat them. Okay? See ya, tubs.
16998	Irv	I've been trying like the dickens to cut down on my snacking, but it's just so
16999	J.D.	Ehp-ehp-ehp! You look great, Irv!
17000	J.D.'s Narration	Irv didn't look great, but I didn't have time to talk.
17001	J.D.	Danni!?
17002	J.D.'s Narration	When you run into someone you used to date, either you find them totally annoying or enough time has passed that you've idealized everything about them.
17003	Danni	Hey, J.D.
17004	J.D.'s Thoughts	"Hey, Jay-Dee!"
17005	J.D.	I'm actually on my way to see somebody, so, you know....
17006	Danni	Oh, okay. I'll see you later.
17007	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, be nice.
17008	J.D.	Danni, wait!How've you been?
17009	Danni	Well, actually, I
17010	J.D.	Ooh! Gotta go!
17011	J.D.'s Narration	And there she was my lady.
17012	J.D.	Hey, Elliot.
17013	Elliot	J.D., I can't talk right now.
17014	J.D.	Should we just hold each other?
17015	Sean	Sorry! Sorry! I couldn't find a parking spot! Heh.Hey, J.D. What's up?
17016	J.D.	What's up....Attention, Sacred Heart! Everyone please gather 'round. Doctors, nurses, patients, hear ye, hear ye.Everyone should know that last night, Elliot Reid and I made passionate love for a good hour and a half. Check that! A _great_ hour and a half.When I hit it, I hit it good! That is all!
17017	Carla	Aww, Bambi freeze up again?
17018	Turk	It's not our problem, honey.
17019	Carla	Tsk-aww.
17020	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
17021	J.D.	You've got something on your face.
17022	Sean	What?
17023	J.D.'s Thoughts	The love of my life.
17024	J.D.	You got it.
17025	Sean	So, I'll see you after work.
17026	Elliot	'Kay.
17027	Sean	Bye, J.D.
17028	J.D.	Peace out, Sean.
17029	Elliot	Listen, J.D.... Last night was really important to me.
17030	J.D.	I know. I mean, you don't want to be rusty at sex before you throw down with your real boyfriend, do ya?
17031	Elliot	Look, you and I have been down this road before and we both know where it ends.
17032	J.D.	I totally understand. You know, Danni and I are getting back together, too.
17033	J.D.'s Thoughts	We are?
17034	Elliot	Danni? Danni, Danni, Danni.... What was her last name?
17035	J.D.'s Thoughts	Damn! I should know this!
17036	Elliot	Blonde hair!
17037	J.D.	Yes! Raspy voice!
17038	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
17039	Dr. Miller	Oh, yeah. That incision's healing up nicely.
17040	Jeff	Thanks again, Dr. Miller. I'm gonna have my band write a song about you.
17041	Dr. Miller	Well, I'm glad I struck a chord!
17042	Dr. Cox	Yeah, listen: While you were proving once and for all that pretty girls do not in fact need to be funny, I went ahead and took a look at your little rock star's chart.
17043	Dr. Miller	Oh, didja?
17044	Dr. Cox	Yes, I did. And his urine output is dropping, so you should probably start him on Lasix.
17045	Dr. Miller	You amuse me. So even though he's post-op and still technically my patient, I'm gonna pretend to consider your opinion before I walk away and do whatever I want!
17046	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
17047	Janitor	Some hooligan keeps disconnecting the alarm.I told Security to look into it? But no, no, they'd rather catch the guy who's stealing organs from the transplant ward.
17048	Carla	You really want to be a security guard?
17049	Janitor	Who around here commands more respect than the men who wear blue and green?
17050	Turk	The uniforms are black and gray.
17051	Janitor	You got me. I don't see colors well. Happy now?
17052	Carla	Look, if you're really into Security, Irv's position just opened up!
17053	Janitor	What happened to Irv?
17054	Guy	Tubs?
17055	Irv	Who's tubby now!?!?!
17056	Orderly	Stop him!
17057	Carla	Oh, oh, okay!
17058	Turk	Uh-oh, uh-oh, aggh!
17059	Carla	He had to be let go.
17060	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
17061	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, Elliot really hurt me. Still, right now I need to keep a level head. My emotions are all over the place, and it's important that I don't do anything rash.
17062	J.D.	Do you have to do that here?
17063	Danni	What? I like smoking after sex.
17064	J.D.	And during. God, you never used to smoke!
17065	Danni	Yeah, but back then I was pretending to be someone I thought you wanted me to be, and that didn't work. So now.......I'm gonna let the real me come out. And the real me wants to do it again...and she wants to do it rough!
17066	J.D.	Oh, I don't know, Danni. The real me's not really into that.
17067	Danni	GIVE IT TO ME!
17068	J.D.	Oh, my God, Danni, I am so sorry. I thought that's what you wanted.
17069	Danni	It was.
17070	J.D.	YAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!
17071	Dr. Cox	Quick question: Will my son ever stop crying?
17072	Jordan	You know what's so sweet? This morning, Jack called her "Da-Da".
17073	Dr. Cox	I'm I'm I'm sorry. Look, there's a new doctor at the hospital, and she is such a relentless chore that every time she's harping at me, I actually see your face.
17074	Jordan	I love that you think about me at work!
17075	Dr. Cox	Honestly, Jordan, I have never despised anyone more.
17076	Jordan	Oh, my God. You have a crush on her.
17077	Dr. Cox	Who said who to what now?
17078	Jordan	It is so _typical_. We have an amazing son, we're totally getting along for a change...but that's too boring for you; it's too nice! So you have to go and blow the whole thing up, don't you? Well, bravo, Perry. Ohh...fantastic!
17079	Dr. Cox	Now, I know you say you love us all equally. But you don't, do ya. I'm onto you, Big Man!
17080	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
17081	Dr. Kelso	Okay. This badge is now yours.
17082	Janitor	I just want to thank you for believing in me. And I want to assure you that I am gonna be guarding these hospital gates the way Cerberus guarded the gates of Hell!
17083	Dr. Kelso	Yeah, that's terrific.
17084	Janitor	Uh?
17085	Carla	Look at you in your new uniform! And they give you a nightstick!
17086	Janitor	Well, actually, this is my dad's. He used to use this baby every day at work.
17087	Turk	Was he a cop?
17088	Janitor	Uh, no, cat trainer.
17089	Turk	Meow!That way!

17092	J.D.'s Narration	I felt bad about hooking up with Danni. But luckily no one knew.
17093	J.D.	You want any water?Well, do you guys?
17094	Carla	Bambi! We know you were in there with Danni. We heard you say her name!
17095	J.D.	Oh, no, no. I was I was in there with my buddy Danny, from the gym.
17096	Turk	But we heard you say "Take it all, Danni!"
17097	J.D.	He's a...really...good...buddy.
17098	Janitor	Whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Moving a little quick there, aren't we, bub?
17099	Dr. Cox	Here's a story: It's called The Security Guard Who Was Sodomized With His Own Nightstick.
17100	Janitor	Why don't we just consider this a warning.
17101	Dr. Cox	Yeah.
17102	Janitor	My cousin is a bank teller, and he gave me one of those exploding ink cartridges they put in stolen money so I could figure out who's been disconnecting the emergency exits!
17103	Dr. Kelso	Nice work.
17104	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
17105	Dr. Miller	Okay, that's all from me, Jeff. Any other questions you might have you can direct to Dr. Cox, here. I'm sure you'll find him to be quite...something!
17106	Dr. Cox	Ha-ha!
17107	Jeff	You think it's cool if I broke out tomorrow and play a set with the band? They're going on tour in Europe and...I won't get a chance to play with them for a whole year.
17108	Dr. Miller	I think we can work something out.Don't worry about it. I will drive him out there myself, he can play with his friends for an hour, and then I'll drive him back.
17109	Dr. Cox	I won't worry about it. Mostly because he's not going. You see, I'm his doctor now.
17110	Dr. Miller	Oh-ho, I didn't listen to you before, so now you're gonna take it out on the patient.
17111	Dr. Cox	Look, I honestly don't think that going to some dive bar is necessarily appropriate for somebody who just had kidney surgery.
17112	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
17113	Carla	Bambi, when you broke up with Danni, you said it was the happiest day of your life!
17114	J.D.	No, that was only because 'Barney Miller' came out on DVD.
17115	Turk	And WoJo's commentary on it? Priceless!
17116	J.D.	Look, maybe Danni's not the love of my life, all right? But she's she's beautiful, and she quirky, and she's very...sweet.
17117	Danni	Man, I get so gassy after having sex.Oh, by the way, some skank named Barbara called, and I told her to back off.
17118	J.D.	Barbara's my mom.
17119	J.D.'s Narration	In life, there are personal realizations....
17120	J.D.	I hate my girlfriend.
17121	J.D.'s Narration	....and professional ones.
17122	Dr. Kelso	Listen, Serpico, I go four steps out that door to my car every day. And that's important, because if I don't beat Enid home from her thighs & buns class, I have to help her peel off her leotard. So remember this: I hired you, and I can fire you.
17123	J.D.'s Narration	But the worst are the realizations that sneak up on you.
17124	Dr. Miller	Excuse me, I need to get a, uh
17125	Dr. Cox	Book about supply closet etiquette? Yeah, look, I'm kinda using this area?
17126	Dr. Miller	Oh, oh, you are so annoying; you must drive your wife insane. ...Are you married?
17127	J.D.'s Narration	Like when you realize you just might have a crush after all.
17128	Dr. Cox	No, no I'm not.

17130	J.D.'s Narration	In a big hospital, you can hide from almost anything. Except your conscience.
17131	Jordan	Hello.
17132	Dr. Cox	Oh, hey! Hey, Jordan! You know what's weird?
17133	Jordan	Tell me.
17134	Dr. Cox	We're so close, and yet if anybody asks if we're married, all either one of us can say is is no.
17135	Jordan	Actually, I say we were married for five years then got divorced, now we're back living together, have a child, but we're in a long-term, committed relationship.
17136	Dr. Cox	Yeah, that's what I say, too.... That or...no.
17137	Jordan	Oh, Mr. Mid-life. We both know what this is about. And you should just go ahead and enjoy your crush! Because, honestly, I don't care. I don't!
17138	Carla	Mm, mm, mm.
17139	Turk	That's sad.
17140	Nurse Roberts	Hey, Q-Tip! Some girl who says she's your girlfriend is on the phone!
17141	J.D.	Oh, uh, tell her I'm not here.
17142	Janitor	Godspeed, sir.What? I'm in a pickle! A pickle!

17144	J.D.	Hey, you wanna play darts?
17145	Danni	Sure!
17146	J.D.	Great! Have fun, I'll be over here.
17147	Danni	Do you even enjoy spending time with me?
17148	J.D.	"Enjoy" is such a strong word.... I...I'm used to it. You know, like cafeteria food, or the constant threat of terrorism.
17149	Danni	Not really. I'm more into tough guys, you know?
17150	J.D.	Last night in bed, I knocked you unconscious!
17151	Danni	For like _five seconds_!
17152	J.D.	So I guess...this is over.
17153	Danni	Why?
17154	J.D.	So, you'd rather hang out with someone you don't even like than be alone?
17155	Danni	Yeah, pretty much.
17156	J.D.	Yeah, me too. I mean, come on, how many couples out there actually have fun together?
17157	Sean	Guys! Elliot and I are in the middle of a marathon game of Hide & Go Seek. If she comes in, you didn't see me!
17158	Elliot	Ninety-nine! One hundred! Have you guys seen Sean?
17159	J.D.	Yeah, he'sWhere'd he go?
17160	J.D.'s Thoughts	Aw, he's a dynamite hider.
17161	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
17162	Dr. Cox	Oh, don't even start, Tarla, or Curk, or whatever you're calling this little two-headed judgmental freak-show. Why don't I do a little piece for you I like to call Your First Year of Marriage: "I do." Oh, kiss, kiss, kiss. "Why can't we have a baby?" "Why you spending so much money on clothes?" "Why you sleeping with my sister?" "Why can't I hang out with my peeps?"
17163	Turk	Baby.
17164	Carla	Hmm?
17165	Turk	I would never sleep with your sister. She's hideous.
17166	Carla	And I would _never_ have a crush on someone else.
17167	Dr. Cox	I do not have a crush.
17168	Carla	What is this?
17169	Dr. Cox	That is a form allowing Mr. Stockton's band to come visit him so that Dr. Miller will be happy that I did a nice thing for her. Ehhhh!
17170	Carla	Turk, he wants to be with Dr. Miller because he thinks it'll make him what?
17171	Turk	Happy.
17172	Carla	Exactly. But he's really only happy when he's...?
17173	Turk	Miserable.
17174	Carla	Right! So why does he really want to be with Dr. Miller?
17175	Turk	'Cause she got big-ass boobies!
17176	Carla	No, no, no. Because he likes being miserable.
17177	Dr. Cox	If I actually enjoyed being miserable, then why wouldn't I stay here talking to you two?
17178	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
17179	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, let's see how Elliot likes it when I'm all over my lady?
17180	J.D.	Hey, I've got something for you.
17181	Danni	What?Okay, I'm gonna buy the next round. Which one of you handsome boys wanna help me carry it?
17182	Sean	We're both good-looking guys, am I right? We'll sort this out when I get back!
17183	J.D.	Okay, sort away, Seany-Sean-Sean!Oh, my God!How could you do this to me?
17184	Elliot	Do...what?
17185	J.D.	Ohh, I don't know! Come over my house, sleep with me, and then dump me the minute Sean shows up so I feel like a complete loser!
17186	Elliot	Oh, you seem real crushed! I mean, you jumped into bed with Danni so quick you didn't have time to change the sheets!
17187	J.D.	You know I only have one set.
17188	Elliot	Look, J.D., can I ask you a favor?
17189	J.D.	Could I ask you one?
17190	Elliot	Sure, anything. What is it?
17191	J.D.'s Thoughts	Damn, I don't have one.
17192	Elliot	Didn't have one, did ya?

17200	Jeff	Hey, Rick!
17201	Bandmate	Hi!
17202	Jeff	Audrey! Ryan! Tim! Jamie! Tobey!
17203	Bandmate	Hey, Jeff!

17207	Janitor	Don't look at me like that! This is your fault, anyway! You two made me dream again.
17208	Turk	Hey, we weren't the ones who caved in to Kelso.
17209	Janitor	I do not owe you an explanation for that!
17210	Carla	You're right, you don't owe us an explanation!
17211	Turk	Lay some truth on him, baby!
17212	Carla	You owe one to yourself.
17213	Turk	Ouch.
17214	Carla	Now I'm gonna let my husband-to-be tell you what life's really all about, because he has more of this than any man I know.
17215	Turk	Archie comics?
17216	Carla	No, the other thing.
17217	Turk	Oh, that's right integrity.
17218	Carla	Oh. Here's your chance!
17219	J.D.'s Narration	I was so mad at Elliot I couldn't sleep last night. Also, Danni snores like a gutted wild boar. But mostly it was the Elliot thing.
17220	Sean	Hey, J.D. Can I talk to you for a sec?Look, things have been a little weird between Elliot and I since I got back.
17221	J.D.'s Thoughts	Good.
17222	Sean	J.D., listen. Did anything happen between you and Elliot while I was gone?
17223	J.D.	Sorry, everybody. False alarm.
17224	Crowd	Awwww.
17225	Sean	Well?
17226	J.D.'s Narration	There comes a time when every man has to make a choice. Whether it's a professional choice...
17227	Dr. Kelso	Come on! What are you gonna do about it?
17228	J.D.'s Narration	Or whether it's a personal choice.
17229	Dr. Miller	Hey. Wanna go for a beer after the show?
17230	J.D.'s Narration	In the end, it's about integrity.
17231	Turk	Oh!
17232	Carla	Yes!
17233	Turk	No!
17234	Carla	No!
17235	J.D.'s Narration	And it's about chasing after what you really want.
17236	Dr. Cox	Here's your beer.
17237	J.D.'s Narration	Even if that means showing you both care a little.
17238	Dr. Cox	Did you...did you do that for me?
17239	Jordan	I thought it'd be fun. See, now there are two blondes you can't have sex with!
17240	Dr. Cox	I don't care! It is so naughty!
17241	Jordan	Hah.
17242	Dr. Cox	Cheers.
17243	J.D.'s Narration	And sometimes...well, sometimes you just have to do what's right for your friend.
17244	J.D.	No. Sean, nothing happened.
17245	Sean	Yeah, I figured. Good talk!Hey!
17246	Elliot	Hey.
17247	J.D.'s Narration	Even if it means sacrificing your own happiness.
17248	Danni	Giddyup, Dr. Dorkian!
17249	J.D.'s Narration	When it comes down to it, you just have to be proud of the decision you make.
17250	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
17251	J.D.'s Narration	In some ways, Dr. Cox and Dr. Kelso are a lot like an old married couple.
17252	Dr. Kelso	I need your opinion about something.
17253	Dr. Cox	Yes, Bob, those pants do make you look like you're holding water.
17254	Dr. Kelso	Perry, I'll tell you the same thing I told a comic I once saw at a strip club in Reno I'm not here for the jokes.
17255	Dr. Cox	Color me intrigued, Bob.
17256	Dr. Kelso	I am considering offering full body scans here at Sacred Heart. What do you think?
17257	Dr. Cox	I think showing perfectly healthy people every harmless imperfection in their body just to scare them into taking invasive and often pointless tests is an unholy sin.
17258	Dr. Kelso	Does sound a little sketchy ethically, doesn't it? Thanks, Perry.
17259	Dr. Cox	Did that just happen? Anybody?
17260	J.D.'s Narration	Me, I was stuck at a couples-only dinner party. There were the soon-to-be newlyweds....There were the girl that I loved and the guy trying to eat her face....And then there's Danni....
17261	Danni	You know what I was thinking?
17262	J.D.	Nobody cares, Danni.
17263	Carla	Aww, this has been fun, but I have to drive Turk back to the hospital.
17264	Sean	Yeah, and I gotta get up early and look for an apartment.
17265	Elliot	Yeah, he wouldn't take this perfect one he saw today just 'cause the last tenant died there.
17266	Sean	Elliot! Rats ate his tongue out!
17267	Elliot	Yeah, but the kitchen was so cute!
17268	Sean	Oh, please.
17269	J.D.	Hey, Turk! Where're you guys gonna live after you get married?
17270	Carla	You mean where _you_ gonna live.
17271	Turk	Baby, not now. Don't know yet!
17272	J.D.	Guess it's just the two of us.
17273	Danni	You wanna have sex?
17274	J.D.	I guess.
17275	Danni	Do I have to look at you?
17276	J.D.	Please don't.
17277	Danni	Shut up.
17278	Dr. Cox	I can't believe Kelso really asked my opinion. You know?
17279	Janitor	Look, pal, if I wanted to sit and listen to someone yammer on about their lives, I'd be at my AA meeting right now.
17280	Dr. Cox	Listen, there, scrub-brush, it just so happens it was the only empty seat in the whole joint. And besides, as a fellow abusive drinker, you are honor bound by barstool protocol to listen to every last word out of my mouth.
17281	Janitor	Go.
17282	Dr. Cox	Kelso.... Kelso really listened to me about this whole full body scan thing.
17283	Patron	I was thinking about getting one of those scans.
17284	Dr. Cox	What did he say?
17285	Girl	Mommy? When's daddy coming home?
17286	Mother	He isn't. If only he'd loved us enough to get a full body scan at Sacred Heart!
17287	Dr. Cox	Holy cow!

17290	Turk	Oh, my goodness! I totally kicked that hernia's ass!
17291	Dr. Miller	Nicely done, as usual, Dr. Turk.
17292	Todd	Dude. Why is Hot Doc being so nice to you lately?
17293	Turk	I don't know, but it's about time. I haven't had to work this hard to win someone over since Carla's mom.
17294	Todd	I thought Carla's mom hated you?
17295	Turk	Yeah, but she died, so I'm counting it as a win.
17296	Dr. Miller	I bought a killer dress for your wedding yesterday. Ooh! Speaking of which, it's only two weeks away. Has your bride-to-be started freaking out yet?
17297	Turk	No, Carla's not the "freak out" type.
17298	J.D.'s Narration	Turk didn't realize that everyone has their moments when emotions run high.
17299	Carla	TURK!
17300	Dr. Cox	KELSOOOOO!

17307	J.D.	Not here.
17308	Turk	Danni!
17309	Danni	I'm gonna go put some clothes on. After all, I am a lady.Oh, by the way, I used your razor to shave my pits.
17310	J.D.	Keep it.Dude, Danni did the weirdest thing last night she called out her own name during sex.
17311	Turk	That is weird. Why are we whispering?
17312	J.D.	Because she hears like a bat.
17313	Turk	Bats hear really well?
17314	J.D.	Yeah, 'cause they can't see.
17315	Turk	Oh, yeah, that's right, sonar. Wait a second, that's whales!
17316	J.D.	No, no, no, no, no. Bats and whales, bats and whales!
17317	Turk	Okay, okay, okay.
17318	J.D.	Anyway, I have to break up with her.
17319	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, just let her down easy.
17320	J.D.	Danni, I'm not sure how to do this but, uh...I just don't think we should see each other anymore.
17321	Danni	Cool. I'm already kinda sleeping with this guy named Danny, anyway.
17322	Turk	Whoa! I guess she wasn't calling out her own name after all!
17323	J.D.	You know what! I don't even care, you know why? Because I bet she's calling out my name while she's sleeping with him!
17324	Danni	No, I don't!
17325	J.D.	See, like a bat, dude! Like a bat!
17326	Turk	Check.
17327	J.D.	Aaaaaaaaagh!

17329	J.D.'s Narration	It actually wasn't that awkward breaking up with Danni.

17332	Danni	Later, butt-licks!
17333	J.D.'s Thoughts	Maybe not.
17334	J.D.	Oh, just make sure you got all your things out of my bedroom, okay?
17335	Danni	I put all my stuff at Danny's house three days ago.
17336	Turk	Crunchberry, wrong pipe.
17337	J.D.	Mmm.
17338	Danni	Hey, J.D., don't come chasing after me like you do with Elliot. Because if there's one thing everyone knows about John Dorian, it's that he always wants what he can't have.
17339	J.D.	That's not true, is it?
17340	Turk	Hell no.

17344	J.D.'s Thoughts	That made absolutely no sense, so just keep sipping.
17345	Elliot	Come on, Sean. I want you to meet this patient, Tommy. He's only five, but he's got like the voice of a grown man.
17346	Sean	Yeah, he?

17356	Carla	Nothing's cool! Nothing's cool!
17357	Turk	Okay, okay
17358	Carla	The centerpieces are supposed to be cupids, but they have no arrows, so now they're just fat babies. I have 187 people who RSVP'd "yes" for a 125-seat wedding. Plus, I have to wear my grandmother's choker, but with my hair up it makes me look like one of those African tribeswomen with a coil around my neck!
17359	Turk	Okay, first of all, you best be nice to my cousin, Mfume. Second, baby, if we have too many guests, you can un-invite some people.
17360	Carla	Really?
17361	Turk	Really. It'll be fine.
17362	Carla	Okay.
17363	Turk	Close your eyes.
17364	Carla	Okay.

17371	Dr. Kelso	Why not? It sounds like something I'd do.
17372	Dr. Cox	You mark my words, if one single person gets a full body scan, I will...I will kiss your ring.
17373	Dr. Kelso	I'll take that bet, champ! You're our witness, Laverne.
17374	Nurse Roberts	How very exciting for all of us.
17375	Dr. Cox	I'm not even sweatin'! Because, honest to God, what kind of gullible chump would go ahead and spend a thousand dollars on some silly scan if he's feeling perfectly fine?

17382	J.D.	She's quite mad, you know. I hope she doesn't rub off on you.
17383	Todd	Oh! Too easy.
17384	Turk	Please, man. I'm Christopher Duncan Turk.
17385	Todd	Duncan?
17386	J.D.	His dad loved doughnuts.
17387	Turk	That's not true. Okay, you really need to stop saying that. The point is, I don't lose my cool.
17388	J.D.	I don't know. Remember back in college, when we had tickets to see Michael Jordan in the playoffs?
17389	Turk	We're goin' to see Michael Jordan! We're goin' to see Michael Jordan! We're goin' to see Michael Jordan! 'Cause we got good tickets! We went five hundred miles
17390	J.D.	Hey, was I supposed to bring the tickets or the sandwiches?Oh, God.
17391	Turk	OH! NO! Leave it on the floor! You leave it on the floor!
17392	J.D.	You shaved your head for the first time after that.
17393	Danni	Wanting what you can't have.

If it would make you happy, we can just go ahead and do the exact same thing we've done the last fifty times you've been in here take your temperature, draw some blood, and give you a rectal. It's your basic "Ah, Ow, OH!"
17400	Mr. Corman	Why should I even listen to you? The last time I was here, you tried to torture me to prove a point. Dr. Dr. Dr.
17401	Dr. Cox	Cox.
17402	Mr. Corman	Mengele!
17403	Dr. Cox	Uh!
17404	Mr. Corman	Now, if you will excuse me, I've already talked to the insurance company, so there is nothing you can say that can stop me from doing this!
17405	Dr. Cox	Now, Mr. Corman, apparently your insurance company's not gonna cover it.
17406	Mr. Corman	Good day to you, sir.

17408	Turk	I'm ready to make the first incision.
17409	Dr. Miller	Nah-uh! You get to retract the pannus.
17410	Turk	You want me to hold the fat flaps?
17411	Dr. Miller	More than anything in the world.
17412	Todd	Thank you!
17413	Turk	Oh, man!
17414	Dr. Miller	Now this is your big shot, so if you don't want me to throw you out of here, you've gotta get through this whole procedure without making a single sex joke.
17415	Todd	No problem.
17416	Dr. Miller	All right, to really get at this, I think we need to go in from behind.AND STAY OUT!
17417	Todd	Totally worth it!

17419	Janitor	You're pathetic!
17420	J.D.	What!?
17421	Janitor	For three years I've been watching you pine after Blonde Doctor, and I gotta tell you, everyone is sick of it "Will they? Won't they? Looks like they're going to! Oooh, the last second, something might oooh oooh oooh!" Come on! Enough already! I mean, you guys aren't exactly Ross and Rachel.
17422	J.D.	Who?
17423	Janitor	Dr. Ross, and Rachel from Bookkeeping.
17424	J.D.	Mmm.
17425	Janitor	Why don't you just let her be happy with...stunningly handsome, full-lipped guy.
17426	J.D.	You know, I I don't even care what you think.
17427	J.D.'s Narration	In the heat of battle, it's important to hold your ground.
17428	Mr. Corman	Doctor.
17429	Dr. Cox	Well, now, Bobbo, you hooked him, you got him in the boat, but he still got away!
17430	J.D.'s Narration	Because victory can be snatched away at the last second.
17431	Dr. Kelso	Mr. Corman, your full body scan is on the house.
17432	Mr. Corman	I'm listening.
17433	Dr. Miller	Excuse me.
17434	Turk	Mm-hmm.
17435	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes you don't even know how it happened.
17436	Turk	Baby, I don't get it. Last night I was the golden boy, and now I'm fat flap guy. Why would Dr. Miller turn on me? I've been great in surgery, I've been nice to her...she's coming to the wedding!
17437	Carla	No, she's not.
17438	Turk	What?
17439	Carla	I un-invited her.
17440	J.D.'s Narration	Yep, it's amazing how your world can change in an instant.
17441	Elliot	You guys! Guess what. I just asked Sean if he would move in with me and...tell 'em what you said!
17442	Sean	"Yes!"
17443	Elliot	Isn't that great!
17444	Janitor	That _is_ great! Isn't that great?
17445	J.D.'s Thoughts	Full-lipped bastard.
17446	J.D.	Great!
17447	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
17448	J.D.'s Thoughts	What does Sean have that I don't have?
17449	Janitor	Don't compare yourself to him. He's better.
17450	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
17451	Mr. Corman	Thanks for the lift. Because, for some reason on Tuesdays, my feet just swell up like Jiffy Pop bags. I'm sure it'll show up on the scan. Oh, if anything turns up green, it's probably an emerald that I swallowed from my mother's jewelry box when I was five. Gee, I'd like to get that back to her....Hey, what's going on?
17452	Dr. Cox	Zip it. I know a shortcut.
17453	Mr. Corman	Help! I'm getting chair-jacked!
17454	Carla	Okay, why are you mad? You told me to un-invite people!
17455	Turk	So, without asking, you went to my new boss and told her you didn't want her to come to the wedding.
17456	Carla	Nooo. I told her _we_ didn't want her to come.
17457	Nurse Roberts	Well, hello there. Can I give you some help?
17458	Tommy	My mommy said you had lollipops. Gimme a red one!
17459	J.D.	So, moving in together, huh?
17460	Elliot	Yeah.... It's a little scary.
17461	J.D.'s Narration	And just like that I saw my window.
17462	J.D.	It _is_ scary! You know, I knew this girl in college who moved in with her boyfriend? Everything changed stopped talking to each other, started fighting all the time and...you know the rest.
17463	Elliot	They broke up?
17464	J.D.	Oh, no, he killed her.
17465	Nurse	Dr. Reid? They need you to check on that stabbing victim in Room 301?
17466	J.D.	Could be you!
17467	Elliot	What?
17468	J.D.	Nothing.
17469	Sean	Don't do that.
17470	J.D.	Why are you here, Sean?
17471	Sean	Elliot listens to you, J.D. Why are you messing with her head?
17472	Danni	It's 'cause he wants what he can't have.
17473	J.D.	Okay, new rule! Hospitals are for doctors and sick people only! Okay?
17474	Sean	Look, J.D., you've had so many chances, and you never stepped up to the plate. Me, I'm terrified, but I'm going for it because that's how much Elliot and I mean to each other. We work. So if you really care about her, you won't mess this up.
17475	Turk	Un-invite my boss, huh? Well, we'll see how she likes it when I mess with her world, huh?
17476	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
17477	Mr. Corman	Listen, I appreciate the lunch. But are you actually trying to convince me, an admittedly frugal hypochondriac, not to get a free full body scan?
17478	Dr. Cox	Mr. Corman, you're not dying of anything! Although if you do try to swipe one more bite of my lamb medallions I will be forced to kill you.
17479	Mr. Corman	Well, look who never learned to share.
17480	Dr. Cox	Listen to me! I am not losing a bet to Bob Kelso!
17481	Mr. Corman	All this concern about my _health_ and my _well-being_, and it's about a _bet_!? You know what, that's a pretty reprehensible thing to do! Well, if you'll excuse me, I have a full body scan to take!You drove me here.

17483	Baker	Miss Espinosa, it was a little difficult changing your cake at the last minute, but I was able to make it non-dairy like you requested.
17484	Carla	My Uncle Ramon thanks you, and the rest of the people at table 3 thank you even more.Oh, it's perfect! Isn't it Turk?
17485	Turk	What's up with the white people on top?
17486	Carla	Turk, they don't have tiny plastic interracial couples.
17487	Baker	I'll just color it in with some chocolate frosting.
17488	Turk	Oh, that's a great idea. Put 'em in blackface.
17489	Carla	Turk!
17490	Turk	What? While you're at it, why don't you put a string in the back of him, so when you pull it he sings "Mammy"!
17491	Baker	Forget it.
17492	Turk	Where're you going? To the back of the bakery where you keep all the other colored cakes? I'ma call Jesse! And we gonna march on your ass!Mm!
17493	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
17494	J.D.	Hey, Elliot.Uh, look, I was just goofing around before...about that whole thing. I think it's great you guys are moving in together.
17495	Elliot	Thanks, J.D. I...really needed to hear that from you.
17496	J.D.'s Thoughts	Maybe it's true that I'm someone who only wants what he can't have. But what if the thing I want is the girl I'm supposed to end up with?
17497	J.D.	It should be me.
17498	Elliot	What?
17499	J.D.	Look, Elliot: Every year we bounce around this thing, and I never have the courage to stand up and tell you how I feel. I'm crazy about you. And I want you to know if I had the choice of hanging around with anyone in the entire world or staying at home with you, eating pizza and watching a crappy TV show, I'd choose you every time.
17500	Elliot	I.... Um.... I have to go.
17501	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
17502	Dr. Cox	Not yet, you don't.
17503	Mr. Corman	For Pete's sake.... Will you leave me alone?
17504	Dr. Cox	Look! This baby would mess with a normal person's mind. So please hear me when I say that if you get this scan, it will ruin you. The next year of your life is gonna be a series of endless tests, and I'll do whatever it takes to keep that from happening to you. Even if it means giving you free medical treatment the rest of your life.
17505	Mr. Corman	How can I believe that you even care about me?
17506	Dr. Kelso	How are we doing, Mr. Corman?
17507	Dr. Cox	Oh, uh, Bob. We, uh, we just had our scan. You win.
17508	Dr. Kelso	And...?
17509	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
17510	Dr. Kelso	Now, Perry, I know that was our first date, but next time, don't be afraid to put a little feeling into it.
17511	Dr. Cox	There you go. It's damn sure not about the bet anymore. You do whatever you want.
17512	Turk	I cannot believe you are freaking out about this! It's a great idea!
17513	Carla	Turk! We are not having wedding PIE!
17514	Turk	That is so typical of you, Carla! This whole wedding has been about you, and I'll prove it!
17515	Carla	Give me back my wedding planner!
17516	Turk	Frank Sinatra as our first dance. Please, baby, that guy has only got one good song. You got...pink roses. I hate pink! Big screen TV at the reception! Big screen TV at the reception?
17517	Carla	I knew how much you wanted to see the play-offs.
17518	Turk	You did that for me?
17519	J.D.'s Narration	It's amazing how one simple gesture can bring you back from the brink.
17520	Sean	Hey! So, U-Haul is parked outside, everything I own is in there. Well, except for this half of my salad tongs, but I-I was using it to scratch myself on the way over.
17521	Elliot	This isn't gonna work.
17522	J.D.'s Narration	I guess the funny thing about love is you never know how things are gonna work out.Like me. I lost Elliot. But at least I went down swinging.
17523	J.D.	Elliot? What are you doing?
17524	Elliot	What are we watching?
17525	J.D.	'Little House on the Prairie.'
17526	Elliot	Mm.
17527	Dr. Kelso	If you're wondering what this is, Perry, it's a list of the hundreds of people who've already signed up for our full body scan.
17528	Dr. Cox	Well, bully for you, there, Bobbo.
17529	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes the smallest victory is enough to get you through the day.
17530	Mr. Corman	I didn't get the scan.
17531	Dr. Cox	I know you didn't, Mr. Corman.
17532	Mr. Corman	Please, call me Harvey.
17533	Dr. Cox	"Harvey Corman"?
17534	Mr. Corman	Doesn't get me as much action as you'd think.
17535	Dr. Cox	...Just in case. Heh.
17536	Carla	Do you want me to re-invite her?
17537	Turk	Do you want her there?
17538	Carla	No. She's too pretty. I want people looking at me.
17539	Turk	Okay, she's out.
17540	Dr. Miller	Dr. Turk. Meet me in the O.R.
17541	Turk	Fat flaps?
17542	Dr. Miller	You got it!
17543	Turk	I love fat flaps.
17544	Carla	I love _you_!
17545	J.D.'s Narration	As for me, all I needed was Elliot.
17546	Elliot	J.D., it's just so weird. I mean, my whole future was right there in front of me, and I just walked away. All because of you.
17547	J.D.	Well, I think you made the right choice.
17548	J.D.'s Narration	I think that the problem with most people who want what they can't have is that, when they actually get the thing they covet, they don't want it anymore. But not this guy.
17549	Elliot	Well, Dr. Dorian, you have me. You finally have me.
17550	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, my God! I DON'T WANT HER!
17551	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
17552	J.D.'s Thoughts	I'm a sick man. Last night, after three years of chasing Elliot, I convinced her to dump her perfect boyfriend and then immediately realized I don't want her. What the hell's wrong with me?
17553	J.D.	Ooh! Ooh! Ooog!
17554	J.D.'s Thoughts	An _incredibly_ heavy sleeper.
17555	J.D.	Wow.
17556	J.D.'s Thoughts	I knew I needed to talk this over with someone who understood me. Someone I had recently been intimate with.
17557	Larry	Yeah?
17558	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, not him.
17559	Danni	J.D., this is Larry. Larry, this is J.D.
17560	Larry	I think I'll go put on some underwear.
17561	J.D.	Please, Larry!What the hell you doing with that guy?
17562	Danni	I don't know. I thought it'd be cool to date a celebrity.
17563	J.D.	He's not a celebrity!
17564	J.D.'s Thoughts	Wait a second!
17565	J.D.	Are you the Soup Nazi from 'Seinfeld'?
17566	Larry	No.
17567	J.D.	Say the soup thing.
17568	Larry	No!
17569	J.D.	Dammit!
17570	Carla	Turk! We're getting married tomorrow!
17571	Turk	Yeah....
17572	Carla	Why aren't you excited?
17573	Turk	'Cause, baby, we've been here for an hour and you've already said it like thirteen times.
17574	Carla	But we're getting married tomorrow!!!!Have you been working on your vows?
17575	Turk	Define "work."
17576	Carla	It's the difference between special birthday sex and _no sex_ on our wedding night.
17577	Turk	Yeah, I do like the special birthday sex.
17578	Carla	Turk, when I asked you if you wanted to write your own vows, you said yes.
17579	Turk	Baby, I'm on top of it, all right? I promise you this weekend'll go off without a hitch!
17580	Carla	Oh, hey, how did it go picking up my brother at the airport this morning?
17581	Turk	I'm sorry, what?
17582	Carla	How could you forget him!? You two have enough trouble getting along as it is!
17583	Turk	Baby, I'm joking!
17584	Carla	Aww.
17585	Turk	Hey, Marco! The invites said no dates!No da ....
17586	J.D.	Look, Danni, the reason I'm here is well, first of all I wanted to give you back your skull lighter.Secondly, you always seem to have some insight in to why I'm so messed up. I mean here I-I chase after Elliot for three years, now I don't want her!
17587	Danni	Well maybe it's 'cause you idealize women and no one can live up to your standards.
17588	J.D.	Why would I idealize women?
17589	Danni	What's your mom like?
17590	J.D.'s Mom	I love you, honey. You're the smartest, handsomest, sweetest boy in the whole world. And no matter how hard you look, you will never find a woman who'll love you as much as I do.
17591	Little J.D.	I know, Mommy.
17592	J.D.	My mom is perfect.
17593	Larry	Look, kid, you're just confused. All you need to do is focus on the little things you love about her. Like...the way she puts out a cigarette...or how when she finishes a beer, she looks inside the can just to check if there's any left.
17594	J.D.	Hm?
17595	Danni	Sweetie, it's 5 to 9, and my Denver omelet's not gonna make itself.
17596	J.D.	It's 5 to 9?! I gotta go!
17597	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, he is so the Soup Nazi! Trick him!
17598	J.D.	What is it again? It's like, you're out of luck in the soup department?
17599	Larry	NO SOUP FOR YOU!
17600	J.D.	Ha! Rad.Oooog! Ow!
17601	Elliot	What are you doing?
17602	J.D.	Just lying here, watching you sleep.
17603	Elliot	Awww.
17604	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
17605	J.D.'s Thoughts	I don't think my hang-up with Elliot has anything to do with my sexy, amazing mom. And I'm not that much of a commitophobe. Maybe I just don't feel I deserve someone as great as Elliot because I have low self-esteem.
17606	Elliot	Do you know that you have really nice hands?
17607	J.D.	"Nice"? Elliot, these are the hands of a god!
17608	Elliot	Heh!
17609	J.D.'s Thoughts	Fine, so it's not the self-esteem thing.
17610	J.D.'s Narration	Then Elliot and I got to witness an event that many had spoken of, but none had ever seen.
17611	Elliot	The arrival of the janitors!
17612	J.D.	Morning!
17613	Janitor	Is it? Is it really?
17614	J.D.	No, I was I was kidding.
17615	Another Janitor	I'd stay out of his way today. He just lost the election for union president.
17616	J.D.	Who won?
17617	Yet Another Janitor	Congratulations, sir.
17618	And Another Janitor	Hey.
17619	Randall	Welcome to work, boys! Be the best janitors you can be today!No hard feelings, brah.
17620	Janitor	Oh, there's hard feelings.Grrrrrrrrrrr...hah! Eh?
17621	Randall	All right.
17622	Janitor	Nyah! What the? Oh! It's like a mechanical vice!
17623	Another Janitor	Change is good.
17624	Dr. Cox	Sweetheart, I slept like a log.
17625	Jordan	Really. See, I didn't notice, 'cause I was up all night with Jack.
17626	Dr. Cox	Tell me this: How do you not scare him when you go in there? Do you wear a nanny mask, or do you just slap on a nametag that says "Hi, I'm your mommy"?
17627	Jordan	I refuse to be judged by a grown man wearing a hockey jersey.
17628	Dr. Cox	Say the word and I'll go out and buy a whole new wardrobe; and to pay for it we'll just sell one of your shoes!
17629	Jordan	Great! We made him cry!If we keep this up, we're gonna scar him for life!
17630	Dr. Cox	I don't necessarily buy into all that new agey crap. One time I saw my mom knock my father unconscious with a frying pan. You know what I did? I kept right on going with my birthday party.
17631	Jordan	I am not fighting with you anymore. Ever!

17633	Billy Crystal	How 'bout this way: I love that you get cold when it's seventy-one degrees out. I love that it takes you an hour and a half to order a sandwich.

And I love that you are
17634	Marco	TuPac! I was watching that!
17635	Turk	Dude! I gotta do my vows!
17636	Marco	Oh, come on, man! That was 'When Harry Met Sally' it was a classic!
17637	Turk	Oh, yeah, dude! You know, I was gonna rent that the other night, but then I remembered I'm a heterosexual.
17638	Carla	Too bad you couldn't remember to go to the airport.
17639	Turk	You told her?
17640	Carla	Yes, Turk, he did.No! ME!
17641	Marco	Idiot.
17642	Turk	Tattletale.

17644	Janitor	Get outta my face.
17645	J.D.	What?
17646	Janitor	I'm just saying the next person that gets in my face is gonna wish they hadn't.
17647	J.D.'s Thoughts	Sociopath!
17648	Elliot	Catch me, stud!You know, most guys woulda caught me. I love that you didn't!
17649	J.D.	Oh! Cool!
17650	J.D.'s Thoughts	Maybe Elliot's just not the right fit for me. I mean, I'm the kinda guy who likes stupid movies.
17651	Elliot	Hey, let's rent 'Kangaroo Jack' tonight!
17652	J.D.'s Thoughts	And I have uncontrollable hostility towards small rodents.
17653	Elliot	Or we could just go shoot rats at the dump!
17654	J.D.'s Thoughts	Dammit, she's perfect on paper! What the hell's wrong with me?
17655	J.D.	What?
17656	Elliot	Nothing. I just love the way you drift off in your head sometimes.
17657	J.D.'s Thoughts	I guess the Soup Nazi was right, it is the little things that are important.Or how she's the only person I know who sneezes with her eyes open.
17658	Elliot	Atchoo. Ahem. 'Scuse me.
17659	J.D.'s Narration	And that's when I realized that I really liked all those things about Elliot, but I didn't love them...and I didn't love her.
17660	Elliot	You're the best.See you later.
17661	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, boy.
17662	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
17663	Jordan	Oh, my God! That board meeting went on forever! It was so dull, I had to read pamphlets just to stay awake. Good news is? Don't have testicular cancer.
17664	Dr. Cox	Tell me, did ya happen to come across any pamphlets on people who only work eight days a year and then spend the other 357 whining about it?
17665	Jordan	What part of "I'm not fighting with you anymore" do you not get? If you want someone to fight with, you have to find someone else. Mm-hmm.
17666	Dr. Cox	Oh, good. Here you're wetting down the floor for the older folks.

17672	J.D.	Turk, I need your help, man. It's about Elliot.
17673	Marco	Why, did you sleep with her again?
17674	J.D.	How does everybody know about this?You're a very loud chewer.
17675	Turk	Dude, I would love to help right now, but I'm in the middle of writing my vows. And all I've got so far is, "Let's give it up for the caterers! WOO! Good chicken!"
17676	J.D.	So now that you're gettin' married, it's all about you.
17677	Turk	No, now that I'm getting married _tomorrow_, it's about me.
17678	Marco	Ooh, still seems that you can take a minute for a friend.
17679	J.D.	I know!
17680	Turk	Shut up, Marco!
17681	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
17682	Janitor	That was a mistake.
17683	Dr. Cox	Why's that? Because you're afraid you can't take me?

17687	Carla	That was Father Paul. He said we can't read our own vows, we have to use the same Catholic ones like everyone else.
17688	Turk	No!
17689	Carla	Yeah.
17690	Turk	Noooo!
17691	Carla	Yeeeah.
17692	Turk	Aw, baby, Carla, that sucks. 'Cause you know, I was gonna totally blow you away.
17693	Marco	Since you guys worked so hard, why don't you just read 'em at the rehearsal dinner tonight?

17705	J.D.	We must eat with them!
17706	Elliot	Oh. All right.
17707	J.D.	Hey, Elliot. Thanks for letting me crash at your place while Carla's family's in town for the wedding.
17708	Elliot	Oh, it's not problem. See ya, roomie.

17717	Dr. Cox	Duct-taped two hours in a morgue drawer; don't piss off the Janitor; end of story.
17718	Carla	...'Kay... I'm ordering more pens. Do you like twisty bottoms or clicky tops?
17719	Dr. Cox	I can't imagine anything I care less about.
17720	Dr. Kelso	Damn these twisty bottoms. We need some more clicky tops.
17721	Dr. Cox	Not gonna happen, Bob. Here I just told Carla to order a hundred thousand twisty bottoms.
17722	Dr. Kelso	Nice face. But can't you just order a box of clicky tops for me?
17723	Dr. Cox	No, Bob. Everybody gets the same.
17724	Dr. Kelso	Fine. I'll just take these.You just bought yourself four weekends on call!Damn twisty bottoms!

17729	Marco	You're not even dressed yet!? We gotta pick up Carla on the way, man!
17730	Turk	You know what, tell her I couldn't come up with anything, so I guess I don't love her.
17731	Marco	Gimme that.
17732	Turk	For what?
17733	Marco	I'm gonna write your vows for you.Ooh! A clicky top!
17734	Turk	Does this mean we're amigos?
17735	Marco	No. It means that I love my sister, and she deserves to hear something beautiful said about her. And I'm positive if your life was on the line, you couldn't squeeze one eloquent coherent thought out of that tether ball you call a head!
17736	Turk	Thank you!
17737	Elliot	God, I can't remember the last time I saw you in this suit and tie.
17738	J.D.	How can you not remember that time we were with those
17739	Elliot	Oh, God! With the two guys!
17740	J.D.	the two guys, and their mom was trying to sing that song!
17741	Elliot	It was so funny!
17742	J.D.	So funny.Till they had to...put their horse down.
17743	Elliot	Oh, yeah....He could run like the wind, but his tail couldn't put out that fire.
17744	J.D.	Yeah.
17745	Elliot	God, we have so much history together. So great to finally be able to call you my boyfriend.
17746	J.D.	Boyfriend?
17747	Elliot	Oh, should I not have said that?
17748	J.D.	No it's just...it's nice to hear it out loud.
17749	J.D.'s Narration	And it was nice. I mean, here I was having my tie tied by this beautiful woman who happened to be one of my closest friends, and I realized that this is what a relationship is supposed to feel like.
17750	Elliot	There. It's perfect.
17751	J.D.	Yeah, it is.
17752	Carla	What's going on with you?
17753	Dr. Cox	Let's see, Jordan and I aren't, uh...we're not fighting anymore.
17754	Carla	Oh, no.
17755	Dr. Cox	Since the baby came along we've been fighting less and less.
17756	Carla	Why don't you get a hotel room? Pour some nice champagne, get in a tub, and rip each other new ones. You know, make it special.
17757	Dr. Cox	She won't go for that!
17758	Carla	Well, you have to do something.
17759	Dr. Cox	No I don't, you jackass!
17760	Carla	Ha ha! Sweetie, you ain't getting any here. I'm getting married tomorrow.
17761	Dr. Cox	Please?
17762	Carla	No. No. No....And most of all, I wish our mom was with us tonight. Not because she was taken too early, but because she would see how happy you've made me, and she would love you forever for that.And Christopher
17763	Turk	Yes?
17764	Carla	I've made a lot of mistakes in my life, but you've managed to erase them all, because each and every one of them has led me to you.
17765	J.D.	Wow. That's a hard act to follow.
17766	Turk	Carla, I love that you get cold when it's seventy-one degrees out. I love that it takes you an hour and a half to order a sandwich.I love that you get a little crinkle above your nose when you're looking at me like I'm nuts. Yeah, like you got right now! Just like that one! I love that you're the last person I want to talk to before I go to sleep at night.
17767	J.D.	Turk!
17768	Turk	Dude, I'm workin' here.
17769	Carla	Turk.
17770	Turk	Yeah, baby?
17771	Carla	That's the speech from 'When Harry Met Sally'.
17772	Dr. Cox	Those pants make your ass look giant.
17773	Jordan	Stop doing this.
17774	Dr. Cox	I'm doing it for us. You suck at Scrabble.
17775	Jordan	Do I look mad?
17776	Dr. Cox	You got so much Botox in your expressionless face, I can't tell.Oh, is that a frown?
17777	Jordan	What else you got?
17778	Dr. Cox	Well, when it's my turn to listen to the baby monitor, I just wait till you're asleep and I turn it off!
17779	Jordan	Perry, give it up. There's nothing you can say!
17780	Dr. Cox	Oh.You and your mother are basically the same person.
17781	Jordan	What did you say!? I'm gonna kill you!
17782	Dr. Cox	If you don't wanna fight in front of Jack anymore, I understand that. But I don't think that means we gotta stop altogether. I mean, Jordan, you are an unpredictable, passionate person, and you challenge me each and every day. And, honestly, that's the reason I can imagine being with you when I'm seventy and you're sixty-five and your face is forty and your boobs are twenty-nine.
17783	Jordan	My face'll never look forty.
17784	Dr. Cox	You're right, my bad.

17786	Turk	Oh, my God. My future brother-in-law is an evil genius!
17787	Elliot	I'm gonna go, uh, check on "Sally"! Ha!Okay, not funny yet.
17788	Turk	So I take it you haven't broken up with her yet.
17789	J.D.	Yeah, I decided to stay with her forever.
17790	Turk	That's great, dude. I know you think you're being nice, but I'm pretty sure Elliot doesn't want to spend her life with someone who doesn't love her.
17791	J.D.	Oh, you know what? If it's okay with you, I'm gonna go ahead and take relationship advice from someone whose fiancee is currently speaking to him. Ohhhh!
17792	Turk	Ohhhh-ho!
17793	J.D.	Gimme some champagne! I need a victory sip!
17794	Turk	Cheers.You're making a big mistake.
17795	J.D.	Come on, man. Elliot and I are like best friends. We love hanging out with each other. Maybe that's love. I mean, who who knows what love really is?
17796	Turk	I do. J.D., when I look at Carla, I see the future. I see kids, I see minivans, I see a beer gut on me, of course, not her.
17797	J.D.	I hope so.
17798	Turk	But you know what's really weird? None of that stuff scares me. Not even when
17799	J.D.	Turk.
17800	Turk	Dude, I'm trying to make a point here.
17801	J.D.	I know. Maybe you should stand up and say that.
17802	Turk	Carla.When I look into your eyes, I see the future. I see kids, I see minivans...you name it, I see it. The weird thing is, though, as long as I see your smile, none of that stuff scares me.
17803	J.D.'s Narration	Listening to Turk made me think a lot about love.Like how sometimes it can be hard to understand.
17804	Jordan	Why didn't you tell me you felt that way, you dumbass?
17805	Dr. Cox	Because you're so much like your mother, you wouldn'ta listened anyway.No biting.
17806	Jordan	Just take it, you girl.
17807	Dr. Cox	Mmm.
17808	J.D.'s Narration	Other times, love's obvious to everyone.
17809	Turk	...Anyway, uh......I may not ever be able to tell you how much you mean to me, but I promise I will try to show you...for the rest of my life. I love you.
17810	Carla	I love you.
17811	Elliot	Aren't they amazing?
17812	J.D.	I don't love you.

17820	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
17821	J.D.'s Narration	In the last three days, I convinced Elliot to dump her boyfriend and be with me, then told her I didn't love her. Still, we're good friends, so if I give her some space, eventually everything will be fine.Unfortunately, since Turk's whole family's in town for his wedding, I'm staying in her apartment.
17822	Elliot	We have to go.
17823	J.D.	Oogh. Agh!My lips are bleeding! Can you hand me a tissue?Aagghh!

17828	Carla	Turk! You're not allowed to see me on our wedding day, you idiot!
17829	Turk	She's mulling it over.
17830	Marco	Oh, my God. I just figured it out. This is one of those reality shows where our sister tries to convince us that she's gonna marry some obnoxious agh!
17831	Mrs. Turk	We haven't really had a chance to talk yet. I'm Mama Turk.
17832	Marco	Oh, hey. How ya doing?
17833	Mrs. Turk	Mm.
17834	Turk	Damn, that looks painful.
17835	Marco	Agh! Agh!
17836	Carla	Hey! I really want you guys to get along today!
17837	Elliot	I hope you die.
17838	Carla	Elliot!

17843	Carla	"I do." And then it's classy kiss....Or sexy kiss....Or slutty kiss....
17844	J.D.	That looks like fun. Can I help?
17845	Elliot	Uh, help this.
17846	J.D.	Elliot, maybe you should pay attention to what you're doing.
17847	Elliot	Oh, really?Uhmm.... How how thin did you want those?
17848	J.D.	Turk and I have to go.
17849	J.D.'s Narration	See, Turk and I had made a pact.The day that one of us got married, we'd play a last round of tennis-ball golf in the parking lot as single best friends.
17850	J.D.	Look out, Tiger!
17851	Turk	That'll play.
17852	J.D.	Hell yeah.
17853	J.D.'s Narration	Oh, yeah, and the guy getting married has to caddie for the other guy naked.
17854	Guy	Huh?
17855	J.D.	He'll be fine.I can't believe you're actually gettin' married.
17856	Turk	Me neither, buddy.
17857	J.D.	Hey, where's the fuzzy cover for my one-wood?
17858	Turk	It's on my nine-wood.

17864	Carla	Turk, we're heading over to St. John's.
17865	J.D.	Thought you guys were getting married at Holy Trinity?
17866	Carla	St. John's is cheaper.
17867	Turk	Oh, plus the priest there looks like Captain Sulu.
17868	Carla	No, that's the priest at Trinity.
17869	Turk	Oh, baby, I wanted to be married by Sulu!
17870	Carla	Turk, are you coming over with us now or not?
17871	Turk	If I work this shift, I can finagle two extra days on the honeymoon.
17872	J.D.	Ooh, nice use of "finagle."
17873	Turk	Oh, thanks.
17874	J.D.	Mmm.
17875	Turk	Look, I get outta here at 4, ceremony doesn't start until 5. Worst case scenario, I'm a _little_ late for the wedding.
17876	Carla	Do it!
17877	Turk	Oh! Whoa!
17878	J.D.	Dude, you're dealing with a nervous bride, a woman I scorned, and two sisters with three eyebrows.

17881	Carla	Hey, Elliot, how are you doing with this whole J.D. thing?
17882	Elliot	I can't believe that on this day you would actually worry about how I'm doing. Carla, you're such an amazing friend.
17883	Carla	Don't do this, Elliot. I promised myself I wouldn't get emotional until after we took the pictures.
17884	Elliot	I just love you so much.
17885	Carla	I love you too!
17886	Elliot	Even though I ripped off your sister's eyebrow?
17887	Carla	That's okay.... You know, this morning she actually said she was gonna look better than me!?
17888	Elliot	Not anymore!Car-Carla, there is a man filming us.
17889	Carla	Oh, he's just doing our wedding video. Hi, Anthony.
17890	Anthony	What's up, babe.
17891	Elliot	Oh, my God! You're actually getting married in a few hours! I mean, everything's gonna be all different. Carla, you never have to have sex again except for when you actually want to.
17892	Carla	I know!!!Erase that last part.
17893	Dr. Miller	So, are you ready for your appendectomy?
17894	Mr. Fitzpatrick	Hey, what do you do with an appendix after you've removed it?
17895	Turk	We make finger puppets.
17896	Dr. Miller	Ha! Don't mind Dr. Turk, here. He's just overly excited because he's getting married this afternoon. I, on the other hand, am the only person in the hospital not to be invited.
17897	Turk	Dr. Miller, look, it's a really small wedding, and you're an amazing boss, and I feel really bad about it, so...there's a wedding brunch tomorrow, and it's only for family and really close friends, and...well, we'd love for you to be there.
17898	Dr. Miller	That would mean the world to me!
17899	Turk	Okay, I didn't think you were gonna say yes. There's no brunch.That's gonna cost me.
17900	Dr. Cox	Jordan, get outta bed. We got a wedding to go to.
17901	Jordan	Perry.... Jack is at my mom's, the apartment is empty.... It's just you and me.... Let's take a nap! We'll sleep through the ceremony, and then go to the reception.

18005	Priest	Miss Espinosa, if your fiancé is not here in the next thirty seconds, I'm gonna have to pull the plug.
18006	J.D.	Do you ever miss the ladies?
18007	Priest	A little.
18008	J.D.	I would, too.
18009	Carla	Are you close yet?
18010	Turk	Yeah, I'm here! Start it up, and I'll meet you at the altar!
18011	Carla	It's for real this time, people!
18012	Turk	Carla!
18013	Priest	Can I help you, young man?
18014	Turk	Mr. Sulu?
18015	Priest	No, son.
18016	Turk	Hey. Baby, look, I got mixed up. Is there still time if I race over there?
18017	Carla	No.
18018	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18019	Turk	Hey, baby! How's the party?I'll just stand here and be quiet for a little while.
18020	Dr. Kelso	Just a club soda, please. I'm driving.
18021	Bartender	It's an open bar, cutie.
18022	Dr. Kelso	Give me a bucket of scotch.Sport, take these and keep moving.
18023	J.D.'s Thoughts	There she is! Do something charming.
18024	J.D.	Elliot, check it out. Kelso gave me his car keys.
18025	Elliot	Ow! What are you doing?!
18026	J.D.	I'm I'm just trying to think of ways to make things right!
18027	Elliot	Well, you can cross off keys in the face!
18028	Sean	Hey, Elliot.
18029	J.D.	Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!I'm sorry, I get excited.
18030	Turk	What do you mean, disaster? Honey, this is an amazing wedding! And I know what you're gonna say we didn't actually get married. But you know what? Tonight, you and I, we're gonna rip it up. And then we're gonna hop on a plane to the Bahamas, where you and I can get married tomorrow amongst the fishes and mermaids and whatnot.
18031	Carla	Turk, for the last time, mermaids aren't real!
18032	Turk	I know what I saw!Why isn't the band playing?
18033	Nurse Roberts	In a word? Shrimps. Nasty, one-day-old shrimp. The band got into 'em while we was waiting at the church for your sorry ass.
18034	Carla	No music. I swear, Turk, I am this close to losing it!
18035	Dr. Cox	Carla?
18036	Jordan	It's okay.
18037	Dr. Cox	I-I just wanted to say that that was one of the most beautiful ceremonies that I've ever seen.
18038	Turk	Oh, boy.
18039	Carla	You think that's funny? Why would you wanna hurt me?Shame on you!
18040	Jordan	So, open bar?
18041	Turk	Mm-hmm.
18042	Dr. Cox	Psst! Get out while you can!
18043	Turk	I'm happy.
18044	Jordan	Happy wedding, nerd.
18045	J.D.	Keep walking, dragon.Yagh!
18046	Janitor	How's it goin'?
18047	J.D.	You wore your janitor uniform to a wedding?
18048	Janitor	No, I wasn't invited to the wedding. I just work here on weekends.
18049	J.D.	Who's that?
18050	Janitor	My date.Forks! Frannie! Forks! Forks!
18051	J.D.	Are forks where the big money is?
18052	Janitor	Forks and ladles.
18053	Sean	So, what have you been up to?
18054	Elliot	Doctor stuff. Heh. You?
18055	Sean	Oh, I I was crying a lot. And then I got really emotionally numb. Um, oh, and this morning, I jammed a salad fork two inches into my thigh to see if I could still feel the pain.
18056	Elliot	And?
18057	Sean	Oh, yeah.
18058	Elliot	Good.
18059	Sean	Elliot, do you wanna get out of here?
18060	Elliot	Sean, look, I don't know what J.D. told you, but...if we're gonna give this another try, you need to know that I didn't end things with you because I was freaking out about us living together. I did it because...J.D. and I have this history and...I actually thought he might be the one. But I just ended up getting my heart broken.
18061	Sean	Sucks, doesn't it?
18062	Elliot	Yeah.
18063	Dr. Cox	Carla?I apologize. I am a horse's ass.
18064	Carla	It's not you. It's everything!
18065	Dr. Cox	Come on, marriage is overrated. Jordan and I aren't married, and we're getting along great.
18066	Jordan	Uh, Perr, is making out with a stranger cheating?
18067	Dr. Cox	Technically not if it's under ten seconds, dear.
18068	Jordan	Ah, not worth it.
18069	Dr. Cox	Look, you and Turk were meant to be together. It's fate and you know it.
18070	Carla	Thank you.
18071	Turk	I shouldn't be drinking.
18072	J.D.	I know. I know.
18073	Turk	Okay, Carla's dying, it's rally time. We have no band, we have no DJ. You're my best man brainstorm.
18074	J.D.	Remember that after-party we had in college, when the stereo went out and I ended up hooking up with that grad student from Brazil?
18075	Turk	Yeah?
18076	J.D.	That was awesome.
18077	Turk	Woo hoo, you made out with a little person.
18078	J.D.	I thought she was kneeling.Ted! Can you play a little music for us, buddy?
18079	Ted	It's gonna cost you double what you paid us for the church.
18080	Turk	Here's twenty.
18081	Ted	Aaaand, here's four back.
18082	J.D.	Kick it.
18083	Ted	All riiiight!
18084	Sean	So, uh...so call me if you ever wanna get drunk and have sex.
18085	Elliot	Bye, Sean.
18086	Sean	Bye.
18087	Danni	Can I have a ride home?
18088	Sean	Uh, well...sure.Oh! Okay!
18089	J.D.	You can't let him drive her home! She says "thank you" the naughty way!
18090	Elliot	J.D.! It's not happening. Besides, if Sean and I are meant to be together, I never would have gone home with you that night and sabotaged everything that I had with him.
18091	J.D.	You and I are gonna be okay, right?
18092	Elliot	What do you think?
18093	J.D.	Probably not.Elliot!You let me know when we are.
18094	Elliot	Don't hold your breath.
18095	Dr. Kelso	Ahhh! Dr. Turkleton!
18096	Turk	Actually, sir, it's Turk.
18097	Dr. Kelso	That's your first name.
18098	Turk	You think my name is Turk Turkleton?
18099	Dr. Kelso	And Mrs. Turkleton! The Turkletons! Can I get a scotch?
18100	Carla	Hey, baby.
18101	Turk	I'm so sorry I messed everything up, baby.
18102	Carla	Don't be. Let's dance.
18103	Turk	Set me up, Ted.
18104	Ted	Um, hi. We haven't used instruments in a long time, so bear with us if we're a little rusty.... One, two, three.
18105	J.D.'s Narration	I guess, in the end, things seldom work out exactly the way you expect.
18106	Carla	Turk, our plane leaves in an hour.
18107	Turk	I know, I just gotta check on my patient, baby.Hey. How's it going, Mr. Fitzpatrick?
18108	Mr. Fitzpatrick	Actually, it's Father Fitzpatrick.
18109	Carla	Could you do us a quick favor?
18110	Turk	Mm-hmm.
18111	J.D.'s Narration	Other times, well, you've kind of sealed your own fate.Either way, you have to trust that whatever's supposed to happen, will happen.Besides, somehow you always seem to end up with the person you're meant to be with.
18112	Janitor	One, two, three.
18113	J.D.	Thanks for helping out.
18114	Janitor	I'm only going as far as the dumpster.
18115	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18116	Guy	Ahh. Ahhhh.
18117	J.D.	My shift hasn't started yet. Try that guy.
18118	Guy	Who, that guy right there?
18119	J.D.	Yeah.
18120	Guy	All right, thank you.Aaaahhhh.
18121	J.D.'s Narration	A lot's been going on around here the last two weeks. Turk and Carla got married, that short guy hurt his hand....And since I totally broke Elliot's heart, I was still trying to smooth things over.
18122	J.D.	Hey, buddy. What's with the giant needle?
18123	J.D.'s Narration	We still had some work to do.Where was I? Oh, yeah. The hospital also had a new attending psychologist.Dr...Molly...Clock.
18124	Molly	This is a really windy hospital.
18125	Janitor	Oh, I'm sorry. I was, uh, drying up a patient's urine.
18126	Molly	Hmm.
18127	Janitor	I'm I'm kind of a favorite around here!
18128	J.D.'s Narration	Not only was Dr. Clock easy on the eyes, but apparently she was an excellent shrink.
18129	Molly	Mr. Witcomb is in the middle of a psychotic break from self-discontinuation of his meds, so we need to get him on Haloperidol IV stat.
18130	J.D.'s Narration	But I also heard she was a little spacy.
18131	Molly	So where were we?
18132	J.D.	Um...we weren't talking.
18133	Molly	Was it 'cause of something you did, 'cause I am totally over it. I don't even remember what it was.
18134	J.D.	No, I mean like we've never talked...ever.
18135	Molly	Well how do I know your name, then?
18136	J.D.	You don't.
18137	Molly	You're freakin' me out, Jimmy!
18138	J.D.	It's Johnny.
18139	J.D.'s Thoughts	Why would you say "Johnny"? You hate "Johnny"!
18140	Molly	Now I'm gonna commit it to my memory forever.Johnny.... Johnny.... Johnny....
18141	J.D.'s Thoughts	Dammit! Dammit! Dammit!
18142	Molly	Okay, Johnny
18143	J.D.'s Thoughts	Dammit!
18144	Molly	I'm sorry, I'm just meeting so many people, and everyone's kind of cliquish and I haven't really gotten to know anybody.
18145	J.D.	So let's talk! It's not like I'm going anywhere, right?
18146	Molly	Great! Oh, thanks. Okay
18147	J.D.	'Scuse me.Turk's back from his honeymoon!
18148	Molly	Nice to meet you...!
18149	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18150	J.D.	TURK! HEY!
18151	Carla	Go ahead.
18152	Turk	JAAAAAAAY DEEEEEEEE!Whooooa, J.D.! J.D.!
18153	Carla	Maybe some day he'll love me like that.
18154	J.D.	He's here! TURK!
18155	Turk	JAAAAAAAY DEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
18156	J.D.	TUUUUUUUUUUUURK!TURK?!
18157	Turk	J.D.!J.D.?!
18158	J.D.	TURK!
18159	Turk	DUDE!
18160	J.D.	Stay right there! I'm so excited!AWWWW, HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?
18161	Turk	The roof!
18162	J.D.	I'LL HOLLA!
18163	Turk	ALL RIGHT, LOOK, FROM NOW ON, WE'RE CALLING THIS "ROOF A".
18164	J.D.	GOT IT!TURK!Eeeeheee!
18165	Dr. Cox	Well, well, well.... What do we have here? The newlyweds! Oh, and, hey Carla.Mark my words, the first year of marriage is just a real treat! Sweetheart, do you remember ours?
18166	Jordan	The silly fighting for control!
18167	Dr. Cox	You broke my jaw!
18168	Jordan	You gotta stop that back-talk early.Come on, glass jaw.
18169	Dr. Cox	Duck and move, Gandhi. Here it is, here it is, watch it ohhhh, duck and move.
18170	Carla	Ignore him, baby. We have a great relationship. Nothing's gonna change.
18171	J.D.'s Narration	Over the next few days, Carla started to change everything.
18172	Turk	Hey, dude, get us some more ice cream.
18173	J.D.	First of all, this is a Rice Dream mm, ricey secondly, I can't get out of these new chairs she got. Am I using it right?
18174	Turk	These bowls Carla bought don't hold a lot of Rice Dream. I can barely get my spoon in it. Look.
18175	Carla	Hey, J.D.? Although we do appreciate the wedding gift?
18176	J.D.	Mm-hmm.
18177	Carla	Turk and I decided we don't want this Sugar Hill Gang alarm clock.
18178	Turk	We don't?
18179	J.D.	I got it.Whoa. I got it. I'm okay. I don't oh, here it goes. Whoa! Aaaagh!I'm still in the chair! I it it's like a bear-trap!
18180	J.D.'s Narration	As I fondled Katya, my pillow girlfriend, I thought about how things had changed for all of us. You see, I had almost forgotten that when I wake up, it'll be the start of my last week as a resident.
18181	Sugar Hill Gang	"I said a hip, hop, the hippy, the hippy to the hip-hip-hop you don't stop the rockin' to the bang bang boogie, said up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogity beat! Now what you hear is not a dream, so listen up, you nappy head! Yo, hear my rhyme, it's wake-up time, so get your white ass outta bed! You see I am what "
18182	J.D.	Snooze!

18184	J.D.	Don't look at me, it just fell.
18185	J.D.'s Thoughts	Please please please please please please please please please please please please please!
18186	Janitor	Proceed unmolested.
18187	J.D.'s Narration	I knew he'd buy it, because today feels like one of those great days in the hospital. People really seem to be getting to know each other.
18188	Molly	Bob, Bob, Bob.... Bob.... Bob.....
18189	Dr. Kelso	Fantastic. Get off my face.
18190	J.D.'s Narration	My last week of residency had begun. In seven days I'd be a full-fledged doctor. It felt pretty special to me, and I had a hunch it meant a lot to one other person as well.
18191	Dr. Cox	Yes, milady?
18192	J.D.	Sooo, ya felling all, like, blalala!
18193	Dr. Cox	That depends, does "blalalala" mean confused and incredibly annoyed?
18194	J.D.	Come on, man, it's our last week together! The J.D. and Cox train is pulling into the station. You must have a metaphor you want to use; hit me with it!
18195	Dr. Cox	I suppose I could riff a list of things that I care as little about as our last week together. Lemme see, uhh.... Low-carb diets. Michael Moore. The Republican National Convention. Kabbalah and all Kabbalah-related products. Hi-def TV, the Bush daughters, wireless hot spots, 'The O.C.', the U.N., recycling, getting Punk'd, Danny Gans, the Latin Grammys, the real Grammys. Jeff, that Wiggle who sleeps too darn much! The Yankees payroll, all the red states, all the blue states, every hybrid car, every talk show host! Everything on the planet, everything in the solar system, everything everything everything everything everything everything eve everything that exists past, present and future, in all discovered and undiscovered dimensions.Oh! And Hugh Jackman. Eh.
18196	J.D.	Hugh Jackman's Wolverine! How dare he.

18198	Elliot	I missed you guys so much.
18199	Carla	Mmm.... Oh, come over tonight! We're looking at wedding pictures.
18200	Elliot	Ooh! There's this one picture of me right after I got sick off my...third champagne and Red Bull, and my hair is kind of like sexy-messy, and the photographer said he could airbrush all of the puke off my dress.
18201	Carla	Already made doubles.
18202	Elliot	You rock! Heh.Ssso, um...is J.D. gonna be there tonight?
18203	Carla	Can't you come over anyway?
18204	Elliot	Um....
18205	Molly	Hey! Do you guys mind if I eat with you? 'Cause I don't wanna sit alone and sing to my food like a crazy person.
18206	Elliot	Oh, my gosh! I do that!
18207	Molly	No way!
18208	Elliot	Mostly pop songs. You know, unless I'm eating soul food.
18209	Carla	Where's your food?
18210	Molly	Oh, shoot.
18211	Carla	Look, Elliot, we'll do something later this week, just the two of us.
18212	Elliot	Okay.
18213	Molly	Ahh. Oh, that is not my food. But I'm not getting up again.
18214	Elliot	Oh, I wouldn't.
18215	Molly	Chicken salaaaad! Oh, yeeah. Looks good.
18216	Carla	I gotta go. See ya.
18217	Elliot	It's so strange feeling all alone when like a month ago I was part of this really tight group, you know?
18218	Molly	Yeah. I had tons of friends at my old hospital.
18219	Elliot	I gotta meet some new people.
18220	Molly	Do you wanna, uh, get a cup of coffee tonight?
18221	Elliot	Can't. I'm hitting the internet hard and going on a friend hunt!
18222	Molly	Oh, chicken salaaad! You're tasty, you're food to be eaten, it's good!
18223	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18224	J.D.	When you get back from surgery, Mrs. Grodberg, we'll play Scrabble again! And this time I'll beat you!
18225	Dr. Kelso	Well, of course you'll beat her, son, she's having half her brain removed! Heh-heh!
18226	Turk	J.D. A little problem this morning with Malik.
18227	J.D.	Our car? Is it bad?
18228	Turk	Hey, Triple A? Look, I need a pick-up on the corner of Fourth andYou know what? You'll see it.
18229	J.D.	Ah, Malik. Lots of memories in that old car.
18230	Carla	Of what?
18231	J.D.	Driving, mostly.
18232	Turk	Beep, beep.
18233	Carla	Look, why don't we pool our money together and buy one of those nice cute little Mini Coopers?
18234	Turk	Baby, a Mini Cooper?
18235	J.D.'s Narration	And then the most amazing thing happened.
18236	Carla	I'll tell you what, Turk. Why don't you go pick out our car.
18237	J.D.'s Narration	Carla let Turk make a decision!
18238	Turk	Okay! But, baby, you should know that it's not gonna be a Mini. 'Cause ain't nothing really mini about me!
18239	J.D.	There isn't.
18240	Turk	There isn't! Heh!
18241	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18242	J.D.	Mr. Radford, if you keep turning down physical therapy, you're never gonna be strong enough to get out of this bed.
18243	Mr. Radford	I'm tired.
18244	J.D.	I know you are, but I would love it if you'd at least try.
18245	Mr. Blass	"And I would do anything for love, but I won't do that. No, I won't do that."
18246	J.D.	Haunting.
18247	Molly	Drink your juice, Mr. Blass.Mr. Blass has Pick's disease, which is similar to presentation to multi-infarct dementia.
18248	J.D.	Mmm.
18249	Molly	Anyhoo, he likes to sing when he gets up in the morning, and the weird thing is, Johnny, he actually captures the mood of the room.
18250	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, you gotta take a stand on this "Johnny" thing before it becomes permanent.
18251	J.D.	You know what, it's "J.D." for "John Dorian," so so John...look, you know what, Johnny's fine, it's cool.
18252	J.D.'s Thoughts	What's wrong with you?
18253	Molly	Anyway, Johnny, I was noticing that you were having some trouble motivating your patient back in there, and I actually published a paper on motivation methodology in post-operative seniors, so, if you want, I could help.
18254	J.D.	What floor?
18255	Molly	Oh, my god, we're on an elevator.
18256	J.D.	You know, Molly, I appreciate the offer, but there's a very special doctor I use around here when I need help, and he'd be pretty pissed if I didn't come to him first.
18257	Dr. Cox	Why, Mariska? Why do you insist on bothering _me_ with these things?
18258	J.D.	Please, you know you love it. Now, come on, one more time for nostalgia's sake: You come see my patient, you teach me a lesson, and then the music plays, right? In my head, it sounds like this: Ba-buh-buh-ba-buh-buh-buh, ba-buh-buh-ba-buh-buh-buh-buhhh.
18259	Carla	Dr. Cox, can I borrow you for a minute?
18260	Dr. Cox	Borrow me? Dearheart, you'd be rescuing me.Newbie, you're on your own. Get used to it.
18261	J.D.	...Buh-ba-buh-buh-buh-buh-buhh....
18262	Carla	I'munna prove to you why my first year of marriage isn't gonna be as hard as yours was.
18263	Dr. Cox	I think you're setting the bar a little low on that one, there, sweetcheeks.
18264	Carla	Yeah, still, the point is I'm smarter than you.
18265	Dr. Cox	In relationships?
18266	Carla	In everything.
18267	Dr. Cox	Right!
18268	Carla	See, even though I make all the decisions, whenever I see Turk is getting upset, I throw him a little decision that means nothing to me. Like buying a new car as long as it's got four wheels and air conditioning, I'm happy.
18269	Turk	Check it, baby! Scooters!
18270	Carla	Hehhh.
18271	Dr. Cox	Fantastic!
18272	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18273	J.D.	He's a drinker!
18274	Elliot	Mm-hm. Clever. Look, J.D., I think this is so unfair. I mean, I never get to see Turk and Carla anymore.It's like we got divorced and you get to keep the friends just because you live with them.It just feels like you guys are part of some sort of gang or something.
18275	J.D.	Elliot, you're overreacting. We're not some kind of gang, okay?
18276	Elliot	Okay.
18277	J.D.	Wolverines, let's roll!
18278	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18279	J.D.'s Narration	That joyride around the hospital made me realize two things. First, it's a bad idea to take a full bladder out on your hog. Also, I had to draw upon all my medical experience to get Mr. Radford out of bed.
18280	J.D.	Mr. Radford, they're showing 'Cocoon' in the chapel!
18281	Mr. Radford	I'm not a big Guttenberg fan.
18282	J.D.	Well, you're the only one, 'cause people in the hall are going crazy!
18283	Molly	Akbar. Akbar. Akbar. Oh, Johnny! Hey!
18284	Akbar	Run away with me.
18285	Molly	I was just looking at Mr. Radford's chart.
18286	J.D.	Ahh, I know you're new here, but that's my patient's chart, and no one touches my patient's chartexcept for him.
18287	J.D.'s Thoughts	Yes! I knew he couldn't stay away.
18288	Molly	Hi, I'm Molly. And I kinda tagged in here with the Mr. Radford thing, 'cause I
18289	Dr. Cox	Molly, Molly, Molly, you lost me at "hello."
18290	Molly	Wow, no touchy.
18291	Dr. Cox	Fair enough.Uhh, Mr. Radford, do I understand you have pain issues but you don't want physical therapy?
18292	Mr. Radford	I just don't have it in me.
18293	J.D.	Here comes the magic. He always gives me goosebumps.
18294	Dr. Cox	Okay, then. I sure hope you're comfortable in that bed, because you're gonna be in one just like it for the rest of your natural born life.
18295	J.D.	What the hell was that?
18296	Dr. Cox	That... was me talking to a patient who has thrown in the towel. You can't save everyone, Newbie, so I suggest you start working with people who want your help. That's what I will be doing.
18297	Molly	Goosebumps?

18300	J.D.	Ahh, Mrs. Grodberg, "jizelbck" is not a word.
18301	Mrs. Grodberg	I'm still beating you!
18302	J.D.	Well, I'm just glad your surgery went okay and you still have your A game. I don't really care who wins!
18303	J.D.'s Thoughts	Half a brain, dammit!
18304	Dr. Cox	Goodnight, Giselle.
18305	J.D.	Dr. Cox.I just want you to know I'm not ready to give up on Mr. Radford.
18306	Dr. Cox	Do you want me to give you my "things I don't care about" speech again? Because, you know, I've updated it to include all white guys who add -izzle to anything.
18307	J.D.	I agrizzle, my nizzle.
18308	Dr. Cox	Go on home and get in bed, will ya. I'm betting your friend Mr. Radford's already in his.I'll see ya.
18309	Dr. Kelso	Well, sweetheart, you're here early.
18310	Elliot	Yeah, well, you know I didn't have any plans last night, so I went to bed at 8 and then I woke up at 4. And then I realized that the sunrise just looks beautiful through the trees, and that my neighbor gets his paper in the _nude_...and that he needs to lose like 900 pounds.
18311	Dr. Kelso	In the future, the appropriate response is, "Yes, I am here early" it's called 'small talk', not 'my depressing life in thirty seconds'.
18312	Elliot	I am not, heh, depressed, sir. In fact, nothing is gonna get me down today!
18313	Mr. Blass	"All by myself. Don't wanna be all by my "
18314	Elliot	Oh, shut up!
18315	Molly	Did you just tell my patient to shut up? 'Cause that seems not very doctory.
18316	Elliot	No. I mean, I said it like all those high school girls do in the mall, like, "Oh, shut _up_!"I should go.
18317	Molly	Kick it, Mr. Blass.

18319	J.D.	Woohoo! Ring around the Janitor! Pocket full of
18320	Janitor	You're funny. Pocket full of what?

18322	Janitor	Not a word!

18324	J.D.	Why the giant X?
18325	Janitor	Why the stupid face?
18326	J.D.	Touché.
18327	Janitor	You know, I know you knocked that exit sign down.
18328	J.D.	Well then I'm sure I can expect an appropriate retaliatory response. Maybe you could shoot me in the neck.
18329	Janitor	Sounds like fun, but no. Our game is over, buddy. Your residency's coming to a close and...that's it, nothing left to do but:
18330	J.D.	What can I say, it's been...horrifying.
18331	Janitor	Thank you!
18332	J.D.	Well, this is kinda cool! Hey, you know, maybe we could, like, be friends.
18333	Janitor	You like huntin' squirrels?
18334	J.D.	I'd never tried it.
18335	Janitor	Easiest thing in the world all you need are some walnuts...and a boxing glove!
18336	J.D.'s Narration	And the day just got better from there.Mostly because Mr. Radford had the same "screw you, Dr. Cox" attitude that I had.
18337	J.D.	Good stuff, Mr. Radford! I'm proud of you!
18338	Mr. Radford	I hate you!
18339	Elderly Lady	Excuse me, doctor. I dropped a nickel in that therapy whirlpool. You think you could get it for me?
18340	J.D.	Okay, but stand back. These things can be pretty dangerous!Whoa. Oh, boy. Whooooaaaa! Agghhh!Aaaaggglghlgggh! Aggghhh!
18341	Elliot	So, what, are they shooting some sort of Geeks of Sacred Heart calendar out here?
18342	J.D.	Actually, no, I almost drowned diving for a nickel; but I'm sure you're more interested in conspiracy theories about gangs and friend stealing. Peace out.
18343	Italian Guy	Hey! Why did you kick'a my scooter? Why? All you Americans are bullies! That is why the whole world hates you!

18345	Molly	Easy, Massimo. It's okay, she's gonna fix it, just go inside and I'll meet you in my office.He's not even Italian.
18346	Elliot	I'm sorry. Look, um.... You wouldn't understand.
18347	Molly	No, I get it. I mean, you're feeling lonely, you're feeling rejected. I mean, most people around here won't talk to me, and even Johnny won't take my help.
18348	Elliot	Who's Johnny?
18349	Molly	You know, he's a resident, he's got like gelled-up hair, and he and his friends are in a motorcycle gang?
18350	Elliot	I knew it!!!
18351	Molly	You know what, Elliot, you act like everyone's boxing you out, but you wouldn't even get a cup of coffee with me.Peace out, baby.
18352	Elliot	Why is everybody saying that?

18354	Turk	Great news, baby. I just picked your grandparents up from the airport!Hang on, Nana! Hang on, Grampa!Not only did I get them home, I lost six pounds! Ha ha!
18355	Carla	Gimme those stupid keys!
18356	Turk	Mm-mm.OH!
18357	Carla	That's what I think of your scooters! No more bugs in my teeth! No more helmet head! No more making deals with God every time a truck passes me on the freeway, okay? It's over! That's it!
18358	Turk	What the hell just happened?
18359	Dr. Kelso	You got married, Turkleton.
18360	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18361	J.D.	That, my friends, is Mr. Radford getting out of bed.And that's Mr. Radford falling back into bed. But still, enough to rub it in Dr. Cox's face.
18362	Molly	That is so great! But I wouldn't do that unless you want him to rub your face in it.
18363	J.D.	Did you not see what just happened, or do you not get face rubbing? Because it's more than just a bizarro way to memorize people's names.
18364	Molly	Johnny, I mean what Dr. Cox did was classic reverse psychology. And so is this: Behavioral modification can sometimes be brought about through classic conditioning.Reverse psychology? Nothing? 'Cause that really kills at the psychiatric conferences.
18365	J.D.	I must go to one of those.
18366	Molly	Look, isn't it possible that Dr. Cox tricked you as a motivational ploy?
18367	J.D.	Hmm, no.
18368	Molly	After he said there was no hope with Mr. Radford, didn't you both work harder?
18369	J.D.	Nnoo! You're like a crazy person!
18370	Molly	Look, I'll tell you something else. I mean, Dr. Cox is a text-book closed-off alpha male. I mean, you can try forever, but you're never gonna get that hug that you really want.
18371	J.D.	Uh, excuse me, I'm not a child. I'm a doctor.
18372	J.D.'s Thoughts	And I'll get that hug!
18373	Elliot	Hey! Watch it!
18374	Molly	Oh! Hot! Ah! Ahh!
18375	Elliot	I, um...brought you coffee.
18376	Molly	Oh, it's burning, it's like fire! Ah!

18378	Carla	Baby, I know you don't wanna return the scooters.
18379	Turk	Can't this wait till after my scooter club's fall foliage trip through Maine?
18380	Carla	No, Turk!
18381	Turk	Maaaan!
18382	Carla	Look! You're a husband now. When you make decisions, you're supposed to think about what _we_ need, not what _you_ want!
18383	Turk	Well, it doesn't seem like you're doing that! You gave away my clock! And you sold my chairs. And what the hell is up with these ridiculously tiny bowls!?
18384	Carla	They're sake cups, Jethro!
18385	Turk	I knew that....
18386	Carla	Everything I do, Turk, I do it for us!
18387	Turk	Oh, yeah? Then why does Rowdy smell like daisies?
18388	Carla	'Cause I had him filled with potpourri.You can keep the scooters.
18389	Turk	That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.

18400	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18401	J.D.	Ka-pow!
18402	Dr. Cox	Look at that. I knew I smelled that odd combination of fear and baby powder.
18403	J.D.'s Thoughts	How does he know about my belly rash?
18404	J.D.	Look, Dr. Cox, I know you were using reverse psychology with Mr. Radford.
18405	Dr. Cox	You do, do you?
18406	J.D.	Yes. And I figured it out all by myself, without anyone helping me or explaining it directly in my face or anything.
18407	Dr. Cox	Well, nubile one, your last lesson and you didn't even need it.Three years and it's finally over. I know what you want, I do.Come here.
18408	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, my God, it's finally happening! Don't miss a moment! Take it all in! Ba-buh-ba-buh-buh-buhh, buh-ba-ba-ba-ba-buh-buhhh
18409	J.D.	Ow.
18410	Dr. Cox	Good God, Fantasia. You you don't actually think I'm done teaching you, do you? D'you not understand the only difference between today and tomorrow is that you wake up tomorrow and start coming in here and killing people, that no one can say, "It's no big deal, he's just a resident." Instead, what they're damn sure gonna be wondering is who tried to educate your sorry ass. And when that finger of blame starts pointing in my direction, I had damn sure better be in a coma from the anger stroke I suffered from the last time you tried to hug me.Oh, and, uh, don't be late tomorrow...Doctor.
18411	J.D.'s Narration	Whether or not you survive in a hospital is all about how you handle your relationships.
18412	Molly&	"All by myself / Don't wanna be..."Elliot
18413	J.D.'s Narration	Whether it's a brand new one...
18414	Molly&	"...all by myself!"Elliot
18415	J.D.'s Narration	...or an old one you need to figure out all over again.
18416	Carla	Oh, my God!!!!
18417	Turk	Huh?
18418	Carla	I can't believe you did this!
18419	Turk	Yeah.
18420	Carla	It's even minier than I imagined!But what about you?
18421	Turk	Ah, baby, don't worry about it, I got it covered. Check it out.
18422	Carla	Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
18423	J.D.'s Narration	As for me, it was my relationships that got me through my residency.
18424	J.D.'s Thoughts	Ba-buh-buh-buh-ba-buh-buh-buhhh. Buh-buh-buh-buh-ba
18425	J.D.	Hooogh! Aaaaaaaaaaauuuugggghhh!Oof.

18427	J.D.	We're not done with our thing yet, are we.
18428	Janitor	No. For you, it's all just beginning.
18429	J.D.'s Narration	The weird thing is, he was right.
18430	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18431	J.D.'s Narration	I was a little nervous today. Maybe it was because I had no idea who this guy on the back of my bike was.
18432	Guy	See ya tomorrow!
18433	J.D.	Will do.
18434	J.D.'s Narration	Or maybe I was nervous because at 3 o'clock, Dr. Cox was gonna name me the new chief resident. How do I know? Well, for one thing, I'm the only one who applied. But I'm also the only one who's truly focused enough to
18435	J.D.	Oh, God.
18436	Movers	Hey!
18437	Turk	So lemme get this straight: You crashed in to their truck, and they just drive you to work?
18438	J.D.	Well, we didn't come straight here.Come on, Dorian. You gotta want it!
18439	Turk	Hold up. They made you move furniture?
18440	J.D.	It wasn't all bad.Bubble wrap! Bubble wrap! Bubble wrap!
18441	Movers	Yeah! Bubble wrap!
18442	J.D.'s Narration	Dr. Molly Clock, the new attending psychiatrist. Yes, she was HOHHHT! But I wasn't a fan. For one thing, she's always calling me "Johnny." Also, she wasn't very nice.
18443	Molly	Hey, sit with us. We'll make room, even if I have to stand.
18444	J.D.'s Narration	What. A. Bitch. Plus, she's _always_ with Elliot; and since I dumped her, we weren't getting along all that great.
18445	J.D.	Anybody got any extra ketchup packets?Thank you, Elliot.
18446	Elliot	Mm.
18447	Carla	So, what are you guys gonna do now that your residencies are over?
18448	Doug	Oh, I'm still a resident! Yeah, Dr. Kelso said I'm the first medical resident to repeat his third year in the entire history of the hospital!
18449	Carla	That's a bad thing, Doug,
18450	Doug	Oh, I'm staying positive.
18451	Elliot	Well, I'm starting my endocrinology and metabolism fellowship. I'm really looking forward to cataloguing all of the genetic variations ofOh, really? Well, excuse me for taking an interest in hormonal regulatory research and relate
18452	Carla	You know, Elliot, I still think you'd make a good chief resident.
18453	Elliot	Carla, for the five billionth time, I'm not interested.
18454	Molly	I think you would be a great chief resident!
18455	Elliot	You do?
18456	Carla	I just said that.
18457	Turk	I know!
18458	J.D.	Sorry, ladies, job's taken.
18459	Elliot	Dr. Cox is naming ass-face, here, at 3. It's too late.
18460	Carla	Well maybe it's not too late.
18461	Elliot	Yeah it is, Carla.
18462	Molly	Maybe it's not.
18463	Elliot	You know what, you're right, Molly. Maybe it isn't!
18464	Carla	What the hell?
18465	Turk?	They're all against you!
18466	Dr. Cox	I'm invisible, I'm invisible, I'm invisible, I'm invisible, I'm invisible, I'm
18467	Elliot	Dr. Cox!
18468	Dr. Cox	ah, dammit!
18469	Elliot	Can I still be considered as a candidate for the chief residency?
18470	J.D.	She asked, without a prayer.
18471	Dr. Cox	Sure, why not.
18472	Elliot	Raise it! Raise it! Uh-oh, uh-oh! And grind. Grind it, grind it!
18473	Turk	You okay, buddy?
18474	J.D.'s Narration	I just needed to talk to someone.
18475	Mover	Tough break, J.D. You've dreamed of being chief resident ever since you were a little boy growing up in Trotwood, Ohio.
18476	J.D.'s Thoughts	What? How does he know that?
18477	J.D.	Thank you, Frank.
18478	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18479	Dr. Kelso	So whatta you think, Perry?
18480	Dr. Cox	I don't know what to tell you, there, Bobbo. Either this kid has a lightbulb up his butt or his colon has a great idea.
18481	Dr. Kelso	Excuse us, Lyle.
18482	Dr. Cox	Come on, Newbie.
18483	Lyle	Hey, do you have a magazine?
18484	J.D.	Not in me I mean, on me.
18485	Dr. Kelso	That young man's father is very important.
18486	Dr. Cox	Don't tell me. He donated a wing.
18487	Dr. Kelso	He donated a wing, a thigh, and a breast.
18488	J.D.	Sir?
18489	Dr. Kelso	Yes, genius, in this metaphor the hospital is a chicken.
18490	J.D.	Please, sir, I totally get that.
18491	J.D.'s Thoughts	How could a hospital be a chicken?
18492	Dr. Kelso	Focus on nothing else.
18493	J.D.	What a jerk!
18494	Elliot	Dr. Cox. Ran all those tests on Mr. Landisman.
18495	Dr. Cox	Top-notch work, there, Barbie! She's good! She's very, very, _very_ good!
18496	J.D.	I am a medical professional, and you are not gonna get me to compete with Elliot.
18497	Dr. Cox	Well, Jo-Jo, right now she's winning.
18498	J.D.	Let me know how to get back on top. I'll do anything, even if it means I have to kill somebody!
18499	Dr. Cox	Well, you could start by getting the lightbulb out of this genius's pooper. Impress me.
18500	J.D.	Oh, I'll impress you!Hit the water!
18501	J.D.'s Thoughts	I'll impress him some other way.
18502	J.D.	Doug! Stay positive.
18503	Doug	Awesome!
18504	Molly	Perry! You know, I have a cousin named Perry. But actually, no, he's not my cousin; and, you know, his name isn't Perry, it's...Jeff.
18505	Dr. Cox	That's so funny. I have an uncle named Stop Bothering Me.
18506	Molly	Interesting!that I need to start publishing a paper to earn my keep. So I'm gonna do this study about conflict resolution between hospital personnel, and I was wondering if I could observe you?
18507	Dr. Cox	Look, "Doctor," us real doctors are here to work, so there's not a whole lot of conflict. Now, my day is already bad enough on account of I gotta tell Mr. Roman that heThat.... Oh, my God. Mr. Roman doesn't need to have surgery. I ne-hever get to give good news!
18508	Molly	Subject elongates words when excited!
18509	Dr. Cox	Mr. Roman, ga-reat news!
18510	Mr. Roman	I don't need surgery! Yeah, Dr. Turk just told me!
18511	Turk	Yeah, you shoulda seen him! He was so happy, he started dancing! Not standing up, but while lying in his bed. It was sort of like buh-buh-buh from like the waist up?
18512	Dr. Cox	You stole my moment. And you will pay.
18513	Molly	Oh, this is good!
18514	Elliot	Molly helped me fill out my chief resident application, so...gonna go give it to Dr. Cox!
18515	Carla	There you go, working girl!I've told Elliot a million times that she would be a good chief resident, but she just ignored me.
18516	Nurse Roberts	Maybe she's racist.
18517	Carla	Whatever. It's fine, it's fine. It's not like all my friends are gonna go to Molly for advice.
18518	Nurse Roberts	Mmm-hmm.
18519	Molly	Nurse Roberts, if you still wanna talk about that situation with your husband, we can go to my office now.
18520	Nurse Roberts	'Scuse me.
18521	J.D.'s Narration	When Turk told me he pissed Dr. Cox off by stealing his moment, I decided not to share it with Elliot.
18522	Elliot	Dr. Cox! Can you come take a look at my patient's rash? It's really weird.
18523	Dr. Cox	Ohh, I would love to come take a look at your patient's rash! But, also, if time allows, maybe we could go over some preliminary ideas for your wedding dress.
18524	Elliot	I have sketches in my locker.
18525	Dr. Cox	Pssst! Barbie! Listen carefully, because the policy remains unchanged: Unless someone is dying and puh-lease note _dying_ not _dead_ I'm not interested. And P.S., just a real strong showing for a chief resident candidate. God almighty!
18526	J.D.	Whoooooooooo. Wow. Don't feel bad, you couldn't have seen it coming. Awful, though.
18527	J.D.'s Narration	I didn't feel bad, because a lot of people were playing dirty around here.
18528	Dr. Cox	I've told him all about the surgery, and he is good to go.
18529	Turk	Hey! So whatta you say we yank out that gallbladder?
18530	Mr. Silka	That's the way you tell me I need major surgery!?
18531	Turk	You said you told him!
18532	Dr. Cox	Oh, stop it. Why would I steal your moment? Except for maybe because payback is a bitch.
18533	Carla	Have one, baby. You'll feel better.
18534	Turk	Thank you.
18535	Molly	Turk, I heard your conflict with Dr. Cox escalated? You know, he's already starting to look like the breakout character of my case study? The one that people love to hate?
18536	Carla	Ugh.
18537	Molly	Anyway, in my opinion, it is more effective to address the situation than it is to become self-destructive by over-indulging a sweet tooth.
18538	Turk	She's right.
18539	Carla	You don't have that cookie, we're getting a divorce.
18540	Turk	But baby, I'm not hungry now.
18541	Carla	Eat. It.
18542	Dr. Cox	What?
18543	J.D.	It's 3 o'clock! 3 o'clock's when you announce new chief resident, so we thought you might want
18544	Dr. Cox	Barbie. You're chief resident.
18545	J.D.	Very funny!
18546	Dr. Cox	So not joking.
18547	Elliot	Yay! Oh, my God, now I know how Liza Minelli felt! When she won the Oscar, not when she married that gay, pan-faced alien.
18548	Dr. Cox	Newbie, how ya doin'?
18549	J.D.'s Thoughts	Keep it together. It's be a man time.
18550	J.D.	No, no. I totally understand. Come on, you did what you had to do. You went with your gut; Elliot's a great doctor. I do have three questions, though: Why do you hate me when I show you nothing but love? Who's gonna tell my mom? And what the hell am I supposed to do with ten thousand "John Dorian, Chief Resident" business cards!?!?!
18551	Dr. Cox	Yeah, Scarlett? You're chief resident too.
18552	J.D.	Uh, what now?
18553	Dr. Cox	Well, I figure with her being ridiculously book-smart to the point where she has almost no interpersonal skills, and you being warm and cuddly as an un-potty trained labradoodle and about as useful in high-stress medical situations as an un-potty trained labradoodle _together_ the two of you make one barely passable doctor...slash labradoodle.
18554	J.D.	Wait, so, if we're both gonna be chief residents, why didn't you just say that from the beginning?
18555	Dr. Cox	What, and miss your hall of fame hissy? Not on your life.
18556	J.D.	John Dorian, chief resident.It's just that Elliot and I doing this together is gonna be a little tough we're going through a bit of a rough patch.
18557	Dr. Cox	Shoot, I totally get that. What you need to do is just give each other tons of space. Here, uh, here's your office.Oh! Enjoy.
18558	Dr. Kelso	Maybe I wasn't clear. This patient is important. Translation: Don't pass him off to dumb guy.
18559	Doug	Sir, I take issue with that.
18560	Dr. Kelso	Son, you were gathering a group of large orderlies to get the lightbulb out of the patient by doing what?
18561	Doug	Shaking him like a beach towel.
18562	Dr. Kelso	Goodbye!Last chance, Perry. Fix this kid.
18563	Dr. Cox	'Course you did.
18564	Todd	Heard this guy's got a lightbulb up his ass.
18565	Dr. Cox	Are are you the the surgical consult?
18566	Todd	No, I'm not even working today. I just want to ask him four questions.
18567	Turk	Whasssup! Dr. Tizzurk is in the hizzouse...!
18568	J.D.'s Narration	Conflict is everywhere. Whether it's out in the open......or bubbling just under the surface.
18569	Molly	You know what I realized by doing this study? Some of the most interesting conflicts are when one of the parties doesn't even realize they're in a fight!
18570	Carla	Really.
18571	J.D.'s Narration	I guess the only thing to do when you're in the middle of it is to hope that nothing makes it worse.
18572	Janitor	Cleaning time!Don't worry, I'll go fast.
18573	J.D.	Owwww!
18574	Janitor	Whoop, that one got away.
18575	J.D.	It burns!
18576	Janitor	Ammonia burns? Hm! Write that down.
18577	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18578	Elliot	Yes, I'm happy! But I'd be happier if I didn't have to share the job with such a jerk!
18579	J.D.	Elliot. I can hear you.
18580	Molly	You guys, the situation would be perfect for my study.
18581	J.D.	Oh, no.
18582	Molly	Don't worry, Johnny. Everyone's gonna be anonymous, I'm only using initials. You'll be "J.D."
18583	J.D.	Great. Maybe we could make it permanent.
18584	Molly	Johnny!
18585	J.D.'s Thoughts	Of course not.
18586	Molly	The way I see it, you guys can either get past it and talk like adults, or you can behave like petty children.
18587	J.D.'s Narration	We decided to go petty.
18588	Elliot	Okay, instead of sharing you all, we're gonna separate you into two resident teams so that J.D. and I never have to see each other.
18589	J.D.	I'll take Doug.
18590	Doug	YES! Suck on that!Thanks, J.D. First pick.
18591	J.D.	Relax, Doug, you're the only one whose name I know.
18592	Elliot	I'll take Indian Elvis.
18593	Indian Elvis	Yes!
18594	Doug	Pick the hot chick.
18595	J.D.	Shut up, Doug!
18596	Hot Chick	Yeah, uh, name's Amy, actually.
18597	J.D.	John Dorian, chief resident. Website's on the back.
18598	Molly	Hey! I got like a two-hour break between patients, do you wanna grab lunch? Or dinner, I'm not really sure what time it is.
18599	J.D.'s Narration	Elliot and I weren't the only ones who decided to go petty.
18600	Carla	Oh! You know what, I have a barbecue to go to. Why don't you meet me there?
18601	Molly	Cool!Hey! Are you Todd?
18602	Todd	Oh, yeah.
18603	Molly	Well, Carla said you're having a barbecue.
18604	Todd	No, but stick around, I'll see if we can get something cooking.
18605	Molly	Hi, I'm Molly.Aaand you're naked.
18606	Todd	Uhhh-huh.
18607	Molly	Awesome.
18608	Turk	Why don't we just reach up there and tug that bad boy out?
18609	Dr. Cox	It's not a rabbit in a hat. If you tug on it, it's going to break; and if it breaks, he's going to need surgery; and if you perform it, then, of course, he's going to need a casket. Sooo, why don't you just play quietly in your area until the crowd arrives.
18610	Turk	What crowd? I thought nobody wanted to take the case?
18611	Dr. Cox	At first. But now that it's become a bit of a hospital mystery, every jackass in the joint is going to want to come in here and give their two cents worth.
18612	Dr. Mickhead	If we could just find the lamp the bulb came from.
18613	Odd Doc	Leon's trained to retrieve things.
18614	Dr. Zeltzer	That's why my wife and I use candles.
18615	Turk	Zeltzer, you are hands-down the most disturbing man I've ever met in my life.
18616	Dr. Zeltzer	Oh, stop it.
18617	Dr. Cox	That's it! I want everybody to get out who is not an expert on lightbulbs! Go on! Get out! Out out out out out out out out out out out!What're you still doing here?
18618	Janitor	What you have there is an A21 bulb on a E26 base. Running a hundred watts, putting out about a hundred and thirty volts.
18619	Turk	Get over here, you're helping me.
18620	Dr. Cox	Not so fast, cowboy. You're working with me, tall man.
18621	Janitor	Mmmm, actually, no. If I had the time, maybe, but I've got a room to clean.
18622	Elliot	Keep up, people! We got pre-rounds to do!
18623	J.D.	Okay, she's gone.Now, I've heard some rumors there's been some fraternizing with some of Dr. Reid's residents. Now, I don't want to mention any names...but, Slobodan, enough of that crap!
18624	Doug	Watch your ass.
18625	J.D.	Now, come on, you nerds!
18626	Molly	Carla, Todd has something he wants to say to you.
18627	Todd	I'm sorry if I ever demeaned you, Carla. You see, my feelings about women were warped by a very unhealthy relationship with my mother. We made out once.
18628	Molly	That's good, Todd. Keep going.
18629	Todd	Monique! I owe you an apology....
18630	Carla	You fixed the Todd?
18631	Molly	Well, without regular therapy, it'll probably only last...a week?
18632	Carla	Excuse me?
18633	Molly	Oh! You're not mad at me!
18634	Carla	Why did you just close your eyes at me?
18635	Molly	I've never been able to wink.
18636	Carla	Ohh. I'm not mad.
18637	Molly	Cool! You're obviously very stubborn and very proud, but you're nice so eventually you're gonna tell me.
18638	Carla	No, I won't.
18639	Molly	Let go of that anger!Not my office.How's it going in here?Wow, you kinda harmonized on that. That was cool.Hm.
18640	Dr. Cox	I'm sorry about the gallbladder thing this morning!
18641	Turk	DAMMIT!
18642	Dr. Cox	It's just, you surgeons ride in here on your white horse and you save the day, and the best news that I ever get to give everybody, anybody, ever, is "Oh, by the way, ma'am, were you aware that that breathing tube you have in your neck also comes in day-glo pink?"
18643	Turk	I needed one, too!
18644	Janitor	Boo-hoo. Where's my win? Think anybody thanks me for cleaning bathrooms?
18645	Turk	Janitor, the bathrooms are filthy.
18646	Janitor	Well, no one was thanking me, so I quit cleaning 'em.
18647	Dr. Cox	Holy cow. Do you realize if we could get a tight enough clamp around the bulb and then just
18648	Janitor	No, no, no, you'll break the thing!Look, here's the thing about lightbulbs, okay? They're structurally weak at the narrow end, but the round end is surprisingly strong.
18649	Turk	So if we could get behind the bulb....
18650	Janitor	I see where you're headed! We go down through the mouth!
18651	Dr. Cox	Your turn's over. All we need to do is thread an angioplasty balloon past the bulb, inflate it...
18652	Janitor	...pull it.I concur.
18653	Dr. Cox	Doctor!
18654	Turk	Doctor!
18655	Dr. Cox	Doctor!
18656	Janitor	Doctor!
18657	Turk	Doctor!
18658	Janitor	Nnooo.
18659	Nurse Roberts	Doug wanted me to give this patient five hundred thousand milligrams of Morphine. I thought I'd check with you before I killed a man.
18660	J.D.	Unbelievable, Doug.
18661	Elliot	Don't worry, I just came to check on my patients.
18662	J.D.	Do whatever you want, just don't come over to my area.
18663	Elliot	You couldn't pay me to come over to your area.
18664	J.D.	Well, I wouldn't pay you.
18665	Elliot	Well, you don't have enough money.
18666	J.D.	It just so happens I have a rich uncle who'd do anything for me, but I'd never call in that favor just to pay you to come over to my area!
18667	J.D.'s Thoughts	Got her!
18668	Nurse Roberts	I hate to interrupt, but I think you need to take a look at this man.
18669	J.D.	Elliot, he's in V-tach.
18670	Elliot	Get the crash cart.
18671	J.D.	We need a one milligram Epi.
18672	J.D.'s Narration	The best thing about this place is that when someone's really in trouble, all the pettiness melts away.
18673	Turk	What are you doing?
18674	Molly	Oh, um, I'm tired of trying to find my office, so I just set up shop here!
18675	Turk	Oh! Okay, that's not weird.
18676	Look	If every once in a while you could let her be the one to give the advice? You guys might end up being friends.
18677	Molly	I can do that.And tell Carla that you did well.
18678	Turk	You truly underestimate how proud my wife is. If she knew I was here, she'd kill me.
18679	Molly	All right.
18680	Carla	What happened to the part about how much I help people around here?
18681	Turk	Wait a second, she said I did well!
18682	Dr. Cox	Turtlehead! You're gonna wanna get a piece of this! Come on.
18683	Turk	Where'd you get the coat?
18684	Janitor	I earned it. Let's get our moment.
18685	Mr. Porter	Thanks for all the hard work, Bob.
18686	Dr. Kelso	Glad to do it. Oh, and, uh, Bart, I think Lyle might be ready for that rough-sex-play talk you had with your other boys.Too late!
18687	J.D.	Can you imagine us trying to do that three years ago?
18688	Elliot	I know.
18689	J.D.	Well, I remember hiding in a supply closet.
18690	Elliot	That's the one.
18691	J.D.'s Narration	Ultimately, conflict is resolved by remembering why you were friends in the first place.
18692	Nurse Roberts	Don't hang up, Lester.
18693	Molly	You should talk to her. You know her better.
18694	J.D.'s Narration	Or by swallowing your pride.
18695	Carla	I know what you're doing. But I'm okay with it.
18696	Dr. Cox	He's coming. He's coming! Get your ass out here!
18697	J.D.'s Narration	Or by uniting against a moment-stealing common enemy who took credit for your ingenious method of de-bulbing a patient's keister!
18698	Dr. Kelso	Good Lord!
18699	J.D.'s Narration	In the end, though, it doesn't really matter how you get there. As long as you're friends again.
18700	J.D.	I miss this. This, like, hanging out, you know?
18701	Elliot	Me too.
18702	J.D.	We should go get coffee.
18703	Elliot	We're having coffee.
18704	J.D.	No, no, I mean like, like outside coffee real world coffee.The point is, we should...hang out outside the hospital sometime.
18705	Elliot	J.D., I still need time. I know that's gonna be hard for you because you like to fix everything right way, but...you just do the best you can, okay?
18706	J.D.	Is it fixed now?
18707	Elliot	Nope.
18708	J.D.'s Thoughts	Shoot!
18709	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18710	J.D.'s Narration	Today I walk in here not as a resident but as a chief. Chief resident! Chief resident Dorian! Chiefy chiefy chief!
18711	Janitor	What's that, your new, uh, cool guy walk?
18712	J.D.	No, I have rocks in my shoe.
18713	J.D.'s Thoughts	Wow, that's a lot of rocks. I gotta stop taking that short-cut through the quarry.
18714	J.D.'s Narration	Anyway, the best thing about my new job is that I command a lot more respect.
18715	J.D.	Chief resident in the house! Everybody say hey-ay!
18716	Councilman	HEEEY-AAAY!
18717	J.D.'s Narration	Even though Councilman Donovan was handcuffed to that chair because once again he was flying high on crystal meth, his respect felt good. Honestly, it's the reason I keep voting for him.
18718	Jordan	Have a good day. Try not to torture anyone so much that they take their own lives.
18719	Dr. Cox	I'll try. You know, you're not looking as processed and overly-medicated as usual.
18720	Jordan	That is so sweet!
18721	Dr. Cox	Come here!
18722	J.D.'s Narration	It was the same old Dr. Cox and Jordan. The weird thing was, there was something underneath it they were happy.
18723	Dr. Kelso	We have some very exciting news.
18724	Dr. Cox	Don't tell me you and Sweaty Teddy here are gonna finally have that commitment ceremony you've been dreaming about?
18725	Dr. Kelso	Perry, even if I went that way and believe me, there were nights in the service when it didn't sound so far-fetched Ted is hardly my type.
18726	Ted the Lawyer	I beg to differ. I've seen Enid.
18727	Dr. Kelso	What?
18728	Ted the Lawyer	Nothing.Dr. Cox, remember a few years back, you asked me to look over your divorce papers to make sure "that slag would die a penniless whore"?
18729	Jordan	Hmmm.
18730	Ted the Lawyer	Sorry.
18731	Jordan	It's okay, "slag" is kind of his pet-name for me.
18732	Ted the Lawyer	Anyway, I was also going through a divorce she's with my brother now; he's nine inches shorter than me but he wears a piece the point is, you and I signed the wrong papers, which technically means you two are still married and so am I.
18733	Dr. Kelso	Well, mazel tovs all around!
18734	J.D.'s Narration	I've never seen Dr. Cox and Jordan speechless before. It was neat-o!
18735	Janitor	Just so you know, I think this chief resident thing has made you a little too big for your britches? Soo...from now on I'm gonna be your britches shrinker.
18736	J.D.	Oh, what, is that supposed to intimidate me or something?
18737	Janitor	No. I had to do it anyway.
18738	J.D.	What possible reason could you have for breaking your broom in half?
18739	Randall	Thanks, bro.
18740	Janitor	Any other questions? Smart guy?
18741	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18742	Turk	What's up, ladies.What's up with these rocks!?
18743	J.D.	HAH! You've been graveled!
18744	Turk	"Graveled"??
18745	J.D.	Yeah, it's a new game I made up this morning when I had rocks in my shoes.
18746	Turk	I like it.
18747	J.D.	Better than Play-Doh Pants?
18748	Turk	Play-Doh Pants became all about the money.
18749	J.D.	Wise!
18750	J.D.'s Narration	It felt good cheering Turk up. See, now that I'm chief studly, I was making a lot more money than him. Needless to say it was a time to be extra sensitive.
18751	J.D.	Hey, you remember how I make more money than you now?
18752	Turk	Yeah?
18753	J.D.	Here's five bucks for remembering. Anyway, I was thinking about spending some of my extra ducats on one of those classy suits we always wanted!
18754	Turk	You mean the leather purple jumpsuit Eddie Murphy wore in 'Raw'?
18755	J.D.	You know it, dawg!
18756	Turk	That's cold!Look, I gotta go. I've got a new attending and he hates it when we're late. Plus he's a question-talker.
18757	J.D.	What's a question-talker?
18758	Dr. Lemmon	Do I want you to be on time, Dr. Turk? Yes I do. Am I going to remember this? Of course I am.
18759	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18760	Carla	Miss Myers is ready to have her bandages removed now.
18761	Dr. Cox	Who do you mean, dashboard-face?
18762	Carla	Yeah, I think she prefers "Miss Myers."
18763	Dr. Cox	Well then she probably shouldn't be checking her e-mail while she's driving ninety miles an hour.
18764	Molly	Hey, sorry I'm late.
18765	Dr. Cox	We weren't waiting for you.
18766	Molly	Great! I'm on time!See, I think as a psychiatrist that I should be there when Miss Myers' bandages get removed, because her accident was traumatic enough. But with reconstructive facial surgery on top of that? In my professional opinion: Yikes!
18767	Dr. Cox	Honey, if you are coming in, I just might go ahead and phone up my pool-man and my architect so we can populate the room with just as many useless people as possible.
18768	Molly	Great! My mom's in town, should I call her?
18769	Carla	Hah! Haha. That was good.
18770	Dr. Cox	Okay, Miss Myers, I'm gonna go ahead and get these bandages off and make sure the plastic surgeons have left your face just as beautiful as it always was.
18771	Miss Myers	Oh, you're so nice. Are you married?
18772	Carla	Oh! He is as of this morning!
18773	Molly	Really? I thought he was divorced?
18774	Carla	No, child, the papers didn't go through!
18775	Dr. Cox	You know what? I've got a son, I don't fantasize about Jordan dying as much anymore, and, even though it wasn't planned, I'm actually pretty happy about the way this whole marriage thing has worked out. Sooo, would you please stop your chirping and step away from my personal life?
18776	Molly	So what's his wife like?
18777	Carla	So scary!
18778	Molly	Mm.
18779	Dr. Cox	You go ahead and have a look there.
18780	Miss Myers	Wow.
18781	Dr. Cox	You look fantastic, you do.Doctor?
18782	Molly	Really fantastic.
18783	Dr. Cox	Thank God you were here!
18784	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18785	J.D.'s Narration	Since Elliot and I are both chief residents, I'm trying not to make it all about me.
18786	J.D.	John Dorian, Chief Resident.
18787	J.D.'s Narration	You know, unless there's someone I could doink.
18788	J.D.	Hey, uh, you need to move your car it's my day to have the parking spot.
18789	Elliot	J.D., you have a scooter! Why do you even need a parking spot?
18790	J.D.	Mmmm, it sends a message.
18791	J.D.'s Narration	Just because I lured her away from her perfect boyfriend and then dumped her doesn't mean my scooter, Sasha, needs to suffer.
18792	J.D.	What are you doing?
18793	Janitor	Just making it official.Chief. Co-Chief.
18794	J.D.	You can try as hard as you want, that is never gonna stick.
18795	Janitor	Hm.
18796	Resident	Oh! And that's Co-Chief Resident Dorian over there!
18797	J.D.	Dammit! You are quick!
18798	Turk	Dammit, I got an appendectomy again?
18799	Todd	Sweet! I get the duah d duoh duo...duooh
18800	Turk	Duodenojejunostomy, man. What's wrong with you?
18801	Todd	So I can't pronounce it. Try and be a little more sensitive, okay? New bra, Janice? 'Cause it's working! Besides, the only reason I'm getting all these great procedures is because nobody's died on me in like three months!
18802	Turk	Listen, man, you never have to apologize for being on a hot-streak. I'm psyched for you! And I wouldn't take those procedures away even if I could.Sir, would you mind giving me the duodenojejunostomy instead of the Todd?
18803	Dr. Lemmon	Am I impressed by your moxie? You bet'cha. Am I going to reward it? Not a chance.
18804	Turk	This Todd thing is killing me.Where's your lunch?
18805	J.D.	Ahhh! Thank you, Barry! Hey! That's for Barry Jr.!What? The little guy's in leg braces.
18806	Jordan	Hi. I visited my safety deposit box today. Guess what I found?
18807	Dr. Cox	My grandfather's purple heart!
18808	Jordan	Please, I sold that years ago to pay for these.
18809	Dr. Cox	Oh...!
18810	Jordan	Mm. Our wedding rings.
18811	Dr. Cox	Holy cow!
18812	Jordan	What do you think?
18813	Dr. Cox	Are you kidding me? I'm gonna wear this the rest of my life!
18814	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, marriage can make the rest of your life seem longer.
18815	Jordan	So you're just going to, uh, fall asleep right after for the rest of my life?
18816	Dr. Cox	So I'm supposed to pay for your Botox the rest of my life?
18817	Jordan	I'm not sure I want to watch you drink a beer while I'm holding the baby for the rest of my life!
18818	Dr. Cox	Look, Attilathere's no way in hell that I'm gonna listen to you complain about the rest of your life for the rest of my life, you got that?Jordan: Yeah, not listening. By the way, now that we're married again, we've gotta make out new wills in case one of us dies.Oh, God, I hope it's me.
18819	J.D.'s Narration	Yep, there was definitely trouble in paradise.
18820	Janitor	Would Co-Chief Dorian please report to the I.C.U.? Co-Chief Dorian? Co-Chief?
18821	J.D.	Well, Mrs. Covello, your CAT-scan showed a small rectal tumor, so I want to schedule a low anterior resection. But don't worry, we have an amazing surgical team here, okay?
18822	Mrs. Covello	That means a lot coming from the co-chief resident!
18823	J.D.	Heh.
18824	J.D.'s Thoughts	How did she hear? She's been in a coma for two weeks!
18825	J.D.	Dammit.
18826	Turk	Hey, buddy! Can I talk to you for a second?
18827	J.D.	Sure.
18828	Turk	I know the Todd's doing her resection, but if you send her down right now, he's a little busy so it'd have to be me.
18829	J.D.	What's the Todd doing?
18830	Turk	Yeah, well, you know the city surveyor is outside taking pictures of the hospital for the zoning commission?
18831	J.D.	Yeah?
18832	Turk	I told him they were shooting a Sacred Heart calendar.
18833	J.D.	Ha!
18834	Todd	Gentlemen! Say hello to June!How about a sneak-peek of July!
18835	J.D.	I don't know, Turk. It's a little early for me to start pulling strings I just got this co-chief job. Dammit, now I'm saying it!
18836	Turk	Come on, man, get me back in the game!
18837	J.D.	Mmmggghhh! Okay!
18838	Turk	O-kay!Okay!
18839	J.D.	You know what, here's ten bucks for letting me help you out. Spend it wisely!
18840	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18841	Molly	I think she's a little upset she doesn't look the way she used to.
18842	Dr. Cox	Why? How did she used to look?Oh, dear ugly.Oh, whatta you know, the paging of the shrew.
18843	Molly	Look, why don't you just talk to her.
18844	Dr. Cox	Mm-hm. Why don't you just
18845	Molly	Mind my own business. I know, your life is your life, and it's not my job to fix it, unless of course you ask me to. And, man, would I get in there, 'cause I'm a good shrink and you, my friend, are a walking disaster.Shall we?
18846	Dr. Cox	So, now, Miss Myers, um, how are you feeling?
18847	Miss Myers	I was wondering...if it were possible to have surgery again?
18848	Dr. Cox	Hi, sweetie, I'm in a tunnel. Look, your body's been through an enormous amount of trauma, and I can't recommend you go racing back in to surgery. Now, I guarantee you, if you just give it time you'll be happy with the way you look.Oh, my God.WHAT!?
18849	Miss Myers	I just don't look like myself. I know I had a big nose and droopy eyes, but they were my nose and my droopy eyes, you know?
18850	Molly	Tell me more about yourself.
18851	J.D.'s Narration	Around here, there's always at least one person that'll come through for you.In Turk's case, that was me.J.D.: Hey, Elliot! Hey, I want to talk to you about this whole chief resident thing.
18852	Elliot	What about it?
18853	J.D.	Well, as you may have heard from the loudspeaker, some residents, the janitor, my mother, your mother, and a...a coma patient, um, I'm being referred to as the "co-" chief resident. I think we should either both go with "co-chief" or "chief." Don't you...co-agree?
18854	Lonnie	Excuse me. We're working up this patient for a hypercoagulable state with a prolonged PTT? What's our next step?
18855	J.D.	Well, that's easy, Lonnie, what you want to do
18856	Lonnie	I'd like my answer from the chief resident.
18857	J.D.	We're both chief residents. Isn't that right, Dr. Reid?
18858	Elliot	With a prolonged PTT, you'd want to do a one-to-one mixing study.
18859	Lonnie	'S why she's the chief. You're the co-chief.
18860	J.D.	Shut up, Lonnie!
18861	Lonnie	You shut up!
18862	Molly	Obviously for your ex-wife, just the illusion of hair is important.Excuse me.
18863	Ted the Lawyer	So you're saying it had nothing to do with my impotence?
18864	Molly	Dr. Cox, I was wondering if we could talk about Miss Myers in my office?
18865	Dr. Cox	Yeah, I make it a point to never enter a shrink's office unless I'm planning on grossly overpaying somebody for telling me something that I already know.
18866	Molly	Look, you're obviously really distracted by the situation with your marriage
18867	Dr. Cox	Something I already know, what do I owe? Will ten bucks cover it?
18868	Molly	Oh, yeah!
18869	Dr. Cox	Oh, you're gonna hang onto that?
18870	Molly	Yeah, you know, I forgot my lunch money, and it's kielbasa day in the cafeteria. Kielbasa!Love it.Anyway, Miss Myers really values your opinion, but I don't think you're even trying to understand how she feels.
18871	Dr. Cox	Look, if I ever want your advice on one of my patients, I'll ask. But do not hold your breath, unless of course you can hold it for a really long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long time.
18872	Molly	I can't, I used to smoke.Kielbasa. Yes!
18873	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18874	Turk	Let me buy you lunch.
18875	J.D.	I'm rich. I'll buy you lunch and some gold teeth to eat it with!
18876	Turk	You know, you only got one more black joke this month before I bust your ass.
18877	J.D.	Dammit! I used 'em all up watching 'Barber Shop 9'.
18878	Turk	Okay, that's it, and I'll get you later.
18879	J.D.	How'd surgery go?
18880	Turk	Oh, you know, I was on top of my game.
18881	J.D.'s Narration	It can be scary to stick your neck out for a friend. That's why it's a huge relief when they come through.
18882	J.D.	How's she doing?
18883	Turk	Uh...unfortunately she didn't make it.
18884	J.D.'s Thoughts	What?
18885	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18886	J.D.	What do you mean she died?
18887	Turk	J.D., I did everything I could. Even my attending thought I did great. He said, "Do I think you did great? Yes I do!"
18888	J.D.'s Narration	I couldn't help wonder if by taking that patient from Todd and giving her to Turk, I had toyed with fate.
18889	Turk	I know that look. You're wondering if you toyed with fate!
18890	J.D.	How could you know that look? It's a brand new look!
18891	Turk	What do you think Todd would've done that I didn't?
18892	Nurse	Doctor, her heart stopped.
18893	Todd	No!Here!I'm gay!
18894	Nurse	I knew it.
18895	Turk	Oh my God! That's your "the Todd would've pulled his own heart out" look!
18896	J.D.	Okay, we have been spending way too much time together.
18897	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18898	Dr. Cox	Guess what there, wifey. You can't be a pain in the ass if I don't have a phone.Oh, ohh! Hi, sweetie!
18899	Jordan	Save it. I was just calling to tell you that I'm taking Jack and staying at my mother's for a few months.
18900	Dr. Cox	But who's going to be looking after him when you and your mother go out marauding for flesh?
18901	Jordan	Thank you for making this so much easier, Perry.
18902	Dr. Cox	Jordan. Jordan, come on, Jordan. Ahhh.
18903	Carla	Are you okay?
18904	Dr. Cox	Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna go check on Miss Myers.
18905	Carla	Molly sent her down to surgery.
18906	Dr. Cox	Oh-ho-ho, wrong day, new chick!
18907	J.D.'s Narration	In a hospital, it's hard not to let your personal life affect your professional life.
18908	Turk's Thoughts	Forget about J.D. You're just as good as the Todd. You got this.
18909	Turk	All right, people! I believe we're done here.
18910	Dr. Lemmon	Did you just sew your gown into the patient? Yeah, ya did.
18911	Janitor	Hey! Hey, someone! Hey! Randall was in the air conditioning vent, and it collapsed on him! Buddy!
18912	Randall	Co-chief. Co-chief!
18913	Janitor	Hey, you fixed him! Come on, buddy!J.D.'s Thoughts: That's it!
18914	J.D.	Dr. Kelso, could you help me out? People have been referring to me as the co-chief resident.
18915	Dr. Kelso	Well, it sounds like something you should take up with the chief resident.
18916	J.D.	But I'm the chief resident. Look, Dr. Reid's check is made out to the chief resident, and and mine's made out to the co-chief resident. But we both make the same amount.
18917	Dr. Kelso	You're right. Dr. Reid, you should be making ten dollars more a month, and of course, Dr. Dorian, you should be making ten dollars less. I know it's not much, but it's largely to symbolize the difference in your levels.
18918	Elliot	Coolio!
18919	Dr. Kelso	Coolio, indeed.
18920	J.D.'s Thoughts	I could spend all day worrying about what just happened, but I have more important things to do.
18921	J.D.	Hey, man. Look what I confiscated from one of the kids in Pediatrics.
18922	Turk	OWWW!
18923	J.D.	What, too hot?
18924	Turk	YEAH!
18925	J.D.	Sorry.
18926	Turk	Not in the mood!
18927	J.D.	Okay, well, look, we both might have had bad days, but I got just the thing that's gonna cheer us up.Ahhh? Dream come true, right!
18928	Turk	Do you really think I want this suit?Well, I do. But not from you!
18929	J.D.	Oh, now I get it. You're just mad because I make more money than you.
18930	Turk	No, I'm mad because of that surgery today. You doubted me.
18931	J.D.	You are such a wuss!Turk, come on.Ah, these things chafe. Now I know why Eddie called it "Raw."Carla! Do you have any powder?
18932	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18933	Dr. Cox	You. You went behind my back.
18934	Molly	I gave you every opportunity to do the right thing.
18935	Dr. Cox	I'll tell you what, there, Miss Manners: Why don't you go ahead and gulp down that bear-sized bite, and then we'll talk.
18936	Molly	Mm-hmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm! Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm-mm. MM! Yummy! Man, that is great kielbasa. But you can't really screw up kielbasa, can you? So, um, where were we?
18937	Dr. Cox	Honest to God, I can't remember.
18938	Molly	Oh, right, Miss Myers. The plastic surgeon said it was safe to operate, and Miss Myers really liked her old face. And you don't have to be a psychiatrist to see, Perry, that if you used to be truly happy and now you're not, then you should go back to the way it was when you were happy. Isn't that what you would do?
18939	Dr. Cox	Yeah....Jordan! Will you...will you divorce me?
18940	Jordan	Ohh, I thought you'd never ask!
18941	Elliot	Listen, I probably shoulda put a stop to all this co-chief stuff.
18942	J.D.	What co-chief stuff? I haven't even been thinking about it.
18943	Elliot	Look, J.D., ever since you dumped me, everyone around here's been treating me like some kind of a victim. It's like, "Ohh, look at poor Elliot going home alone." Or, "Ohh, look at poor Elliot riding a tandem bike by herself." That's not something I normally do, I just really wanted ice cream the other night, my car was out of gas, and that's the bike the Gundersons loaned me. They do everything together....
18944	J.D.	Okay....
18945	Elliot	The point is it was nice being the one chief resident for a while, you know?
18946	J.D.	She's got fingers like biceps!
18947	Ted the Lawyer	And so, by the power vested in me by the American Bar Association, I pronounce you ex-husband and ex-wife. You may now do whatever the hell you want!
18948	Jordan	I've never been this happy.
18949	Dr. Cox	Me neither.
18950	Carla	You have no chance of being normal.
18951	J.D.	Mm-mm.Thirsty, huh?
18952	Ted the Lawyer	Helps the tears taste less bitter.
18953	J.D.	Cheers.So! How you guys gonna celebrate your divorce?
18954	Turk	By not inviting you!
18955	J.D.	Oh my God! Dude! I doubted you for a second, why are you so mad?
18956	Turk	Maybe I needed you to believe in me!
18957	Carla	I believe in you, baby.
18958	Turk	Yeah, but we're married that doesn't count.
18959	Carla	What the? Ow, ow, ow, what?
18960	J.D.	Did you, uh...?
18961	Turk	Yeah, she's been graveled.
18962	J.D.	Nice work.Look, man, it was one second of doubt, okay? Since when do you care what anybody else thinks?
18963	Turk	I don't. I care what you think. Since the day I met you, you've...treated me like I was the man, like I could accomplish everything. This is gonna sound lame, but
18964	Softball Player	I've got it!
18965	Turk	your being like that's one of the reasons I've gotten to where I am.
18966	J.D.	Wow. That's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.
18967	J.D.'s Narration	In the end, every relationship needs maintenance.
18968	Turk	Hey, Ted. Get out the sun, man.
18969	Ted the Lawyer	You owe me money!
18970	J.D.'s Narration	...Whether it's the smallest gesture...
18971	Dr. Cox	Hey, Doctor. Doctor!Want to, uh, you wanna take a look at the guy in 302 and tell me whether or not you think he's really sick or just bonkers?
18972	Molly	Are you actually asking my opinion?
18973	Dr. Cox	Well, I'm gonna ignore it, but...yeah, knock yourself out.
18974	J.D.'s Narration	...or just picking up back where you left off.
18975	Turk	I'm a little nervous about surgery tomorrow.
18976	J.D.	Aw, you'll kick ass.
18977	Carla	So are you guys gonna go out tonight?
18978	Turk	No, we're gonna stay in.
18979	Carla	Well, I'll be in the bedroom with all the straight people.
18980	J.D.	Are your giblets warm?
18981	Turk	Like a Christmas ham!
18982	J.D.	Same!
18983	J.D.'s Narration	The bottom line is that if you care about someone, it's pretty easy to make the sacrifice.
18984	Elliot	Wow. Thanks, J.D.Ow!
18985	J.D.	And she's just been graveled!
18986	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18987	J.D.'s Narration	Being the new doctor at a hospital can be difficult. That's why it's always nice when someone takes the time to reach out and befriend you.
18988	Doctor	Hey! I'm Ron, I'm a new doctor here.
18989	J.D.	Hey, Ron, the I Don't Care ward's down there.
18990	J.D.'s Narration	Anyway, the person who reached out to Molly...was Elliot.
18991	Elliot	Hey, do you wanna go down to Little Tokyo and do karaoke with me tonight?
18992	Molly	Do people with trichotillomania compulsively pull their hair out?
18993	Elliot	Do they?
18994	Molly	Yeah!
18995	Elliot	Cool. 'Cause inviting you to karaoke is kind of a big deal to me. I'm a little shy about my "-aoke." Heh.
18996	Molly	I'm sure you have nothing to be embarrassed about.
18997	Elliot	Oh, I don't know. I'm pretty tone-deaf. And I do these, like, kick moves that I don't think people really get. Plus I sometimes wear a cape.
18998	J.D.'s Thoughts	It's not.
18999	J.D.	Ooh, Dr. Cox, can I ask you something?
19000	Dr. Cox	The answer is yes, it was me who saw you doing leg lifts in the gym on that inflatable ball. It was quite the display of girl power. Absolutely loved the leg warmers!
19001	J.D.	First of all, they were just big socks, okay? And secondly, if you need to do some laundry, here's the washboard, right?
19002	Dr. Cox	What do you want?
19003	J.D.	As co-chief resident, I've noticed that some of my residents are a little overwhelmed. And I-I-I think it would be nice if you gave 'em one of your patented pep-talks, you know?
19004	Dr. Cox	I'll be more than glad to give your residents a little pep-talk.Each and every one of you is going to kill a patient. At some point during your residency you will screw up, they will die, and it will be burned into your conscience forever. Hell, take pee-pants, here
19005	Doug	"Pee-pants."
19006	Dr. Cox	he just might go ahead and get himself a good clean kill this morning, seeing as his patient, Mrs. Samson, is in DKA and he hasn't been tracking her phosphate level. Her phosphate level. Her phosphate level.
19007	J.D.	Doug!!! Stop writing and go!
19008	Dr. Cox	That young man has killed so many patients, I'm starting to think he just might be a government operative.
19009	J.D.	Thank you...thank you, Dr. Cox.... Uhh, okay, guys, pizza and punch in the penthouse.Doug!Wrong patient one bed over.
19010	Doug	Hey there!
19011	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19012	Turk	This is like my eleventh slice.
19013	J.D.	Cannonball this!
19014	Turk	Mm.That's the good stuff!
19015	J.D.	So anyway, after Dr. Cox scared them, no one wanted pizza or punch. Except for Doug, who'd worked up a hearty appetite neglecting Mrs. Samson into a coma.
19016	Carla	Turk! What is Rowdy doing in my closet?
19017	Turk	He's guarding your shoes, baby!
19018	Carla	He almost gave me a heart attack!
19019	Turk	Baby, could you do me a favor and not hold him by the haunches like that? Yeah, he has hip dysplasia.
19020	J.D.	He's a pure-bred it's genetic.
19021	Carla	She releases Rowdy from her grip, dropping him to the floor.I am sick of that creepy thing! I want him out of my house!
19022	Turk	Wow, isn't that a shocker, you don't care about something that's important to me. You know what? Why don't you just throw him out?
19023	J.D.	Don't listen to him! He's drunk on cheese!
19024	Turk	And don't think Rowdy doesn't know what's going on here!
19025	Carla	What's he gonna do?
19026	J.D.	Easy, boy. She ain't worth it.
19027	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19028	J.D.	So, Mrs. Carter, it turns out your fever was just a reaction to the anesthetic we gave you during your cataract surgery. I'm sending you home.
19029	Mrs. Carter	Can I drive my trans-am?
19030	J.D.	That's not up to me, Mrs. Carter. It's up to the police and the owner of those horses you killed.
19031	Mrs. Carter	Ohhh, they were everywhere!
19032	J.D.	You were on a race-track, Mrs. Carter.
19033	Elliot	I don't get why Turk was so upset about Rowdy. I mean, he's just a creepy, stuffed, stupid yellow dead dog.Too many adjectives?
19034	Molly	Well, I'm sure he's more than a pet to Turk. I mean he's basically a link to his childhood.
19035	Carla	He bought him eight years ago at a garage sale.
19036	Molly	Oh, well, then he's just a Nutter Butter.
19037	Carla	Still...I think I really hurt his feelings.
19038	Elliot	Maybe you should do something nice for Rowdy. Like get him cleaned.
19039	Carla	Hmm.
19040	Groomer 1	Mm-mm-mm.
19041	Groomer 2	Nope.
19042	Carla	Your sign doesn't say live dog groomer!
19043	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19044	J.D.'s Narration	As doctors, we always take patients' histories, even though there usually aren't a lot of surprises.
19045	Elliot	And, Mr. Phillips, do you exercise?
19046	Mr. Phillips	Yoga every morning.
19047	Elliot	Ugh, I can't do yoga all that deep breathing. I hate breathing. Except, you know, to live. Umm, do you drink?
19048	Mr. Phillips	Occasional glass of wine with dinner.
19049	Elliot	And any drug use?
19050	Mr. Phillips	Been on and off heroin for the last eight years, but I've been clean for the last six months. See? Look, no track marks.
19051	Kid	Way to go, daddy!
19052	Mr. Phillips	'S my biggest fan!
19053	Elliot	Heh. Umm.... Do you smoke cigarettes?
19054	Mr. Phillips	No way.
19055	Elliot	Of course not. Those things'll kill ya.
19056	J.D.	Mr. Daniels, some fluid has gathered near your heart, so I'm gonna schedule a periocardiocentesis and drain it with a needle.
19057	Mr. Daniels	Someone's gonna stick a needle in my chest?
19058	J.D.	Not just someone Dr. de Man.
19059	Mr. Daniels	Who is Dr. de Man?
19060	J.D.	Say it...say it without the "Dr."
19061	Mr. Daniels	Who's Mr. de Man?
19062	J.D.	No, just say the the last name.
19063	Mr. Daniels	Who's de Man?
19064	J.D.	I'm de Man!
19065	J.D.'s Thoughts	All right, now that you've got his confidence, drive it home.
19066	J.D.	So I'll go ahead and schedule the procedure.
19067	Mr. Daniels	If you think it's the right thing to do.
19068	J.D.	I do.Dr. Cox, I want to thank you for that "everyone's a murderer" speech. Nice scare tactic. Unfortunately, my residents have stopped eating.
19069	Dr. Cox	That wasn't a scare tactic, Portia! Eventually everyone commits a sin of omission or doesn't act quickly enough, and somebody kicks the bucket. It's really...it's really not a question of "if" it's a question of "when."
19070	J.D.'s Thoughts	It's strange. Even though a lot of patients have died under my care, I don't think I've killed any of them....
19071	J.D.	Heaven's a diner?
19072	Mrs. Tanner	Get anything you want, dear.
19073	J.D.	Ooh! Maybe I'll have some flapjacks!
19074	Elaine	They don't have those.
19075	J.D.	No flapjacks in heaven!?! Are flapjacks evil?
19076	Mr. Bursky	No.
19077	Mr. Simon	I mean, you weren't a great doctor.
19078	Elaine	He was nervous.
19079	Mrs. Tanner	Oh, like a little bird!
19080	J.D.	You know what? I left my wallet back on earth.Haha! Suckers!

19082	Janitor	Heard you're trying to clean a dead dog.
19083	Carla	Yeah, who told you that?
19084	Janitor	Mmm, the wind.... Blonde doctor.
19085	Carla	Oh.
19086	Janitor	I can clean it for you.
19087	Carla	Why would you do that?
19088	Janitor	I don't know.... Still a little drunk from breakfast. Plus, taxidermy used to be kind a...hobby of mine. You know, till the state took my license away.
19089	Carla	How come?
19090	Ted the Lawyer	What happened to all the cute little squirrels, Flo?
19091	Janitor	Let's call this meeting to order. Uh, first things first, I counted the ballots, and, uh, someone voted twice. Interesting. I'm not pointing fingers Troy.There were never any squirrels.
19092	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19093	Elliot	Turk. Got this patient who's got a damaged heart valve and needs a replacement.
19094	Turk	Is he a good candidate for surgery?
19095	Elliot	Definitely. Thirty-five, married, good job, cute little boy, great dog.... Can't remember what kind they said long-time recovering heroin addict a bulldog! That's what it was! Named Paris after the city, not the slutty socialite tramp.
19096	Turk	He's a heroin addict?
19097	Elliot	Yeah, but he is, like, super serious about his sobriety. I mean, he's been to rehab like six times.
19098	Turk	Sounds like he needs to dial it up to super-duper serious, huh!
19099	Elliot	I'll tell him!
19100	Turk	Look, Elliot, you know the chief of surgery isn't gonna accept the surgical risk of a valve replacement on someone who's just gonna destroy it with drugs.
19101	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19102	Turk	Want some of my pancakes?
19103	J.D.	Uh, devil cakes? No thank you!
19104	Turk	Hell yeah, I have. Remember my first year? Mr. Quinn? I forgot to write the order for his albumin drip and he...hemorrhaged and died.
19105	J.D.'s Narration	And it turned out Turk wasn't the only one.
19106	Elliot	Mmm, Mrs. Kahn, my second year.
19107	Doug	Uh, Mrs. Studebaker, forty minutes into my first day.
19108	Dr. Kelso	I've been a doctor for thirty years. What do you think?
19109	Doug	On my third day, there was Mr. Kirshnar.
19110	Todd	Jenny Roth, about eight weeks ago. It was really tough, because she was hot.
19111	Doug	And then later that third dayOh, boy, that can't be good.
19112	Dr. Cox	No, Newbie, I have not killed. But I happen to be, as always, the exception that proves the rule. So, right about now, you gotta be asking yourself, do you think you're that good?
19113	J.D.	Oh my God. I'm gonna kill someone.
19114	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19115	Elliot	Anyway, because of the heroin use, surgery doesn't want to give Mr. Phillips a heart valve. So now an ethics committee is gonna decide if he gets the operation or not. And I'm freakin' out, because I've gotta go and argue his case atOh my God! Is it already two o'clock!?
19116	Molly	Oh, relax, that's Greenland time. This way I remember to call my mom on her vacation before she goes on the boat.
19117	Elliot	"The boat"?
19118	Molly	Yeah, she's been sleeping with a commercial salmon fisherman.
19119	Elliot	How fun for her!
19120	Molly	Look, I've dealt with a lot of ethics committees, and you're gonna be great. I mean the key is just be confident.
19121	Elliot	Well, I'm not.
19122	Molly	I tell you what: I'll go with you for moral support. And, you know, if things get dicey 'cause it's just a bunch of stuffed shirts, then we could make out and they'll give you whatever you want.
19123	Todd	What? I thought I heard something.
19124	Elliot	Goodbye, Todd.
19125	Todd	Back to the transplant.
19126	Elliot	So, who's even on an ethics committee?
19127	Molly	Well, obviously higher ups. Umm......the Chief of Medicine.... A sharp legal mind.... And an older doctor with a wealth of experience.
19128	Dr. Kelso	If Edwards is dead, I want his cupcake.
19129	Ted the Lawyer	Not yet.
19130	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19131	J.D.'s Narration	As I was contemplating how easy it would be to make my first fatal mistake, I had a feeling that Mr. Daniels felt good about this procedure.
19132	Mr. Daniels	You know, I feel good about this procedure.
19133	J.D.'s Narration	See?
19134	J.D.	This procedure's too risky right now, Mr. Daniels, I think we should wait.
19135	J.D.'s Narration	And, of course, the classic, "No matter how clean the janitor gets your husband's dead dog, you still need to put him in the trunk and not accidentally leave him on the roof when you drive off."And finally, the lesser-known, "You can accomplish anything with a friend by your side."
19136	Elliot	I understand that because of his drug problem, some of you don't think that Mr. Phillips is a good candidate for surgery, but believe me, he understands that this heart valve is a responsibility. Those of you who have met him, like Ted, can attest to this.
19137	Dr. Kelso	This is a very dicey case. Ted, what do you think?
19138	Ted the Lawyer	She knows my name! Whatever she wants!
19139	Dr. Kelso	Very ethical. Why don't I open the floor to those people who currently do not have erections? Dr. Clock. Do you think this guy'll stay clean?
19140	Molly	Oh, I'm just here as a friend. I-I think you should ask Ted again.
19141	Ted the Lawyer	Oh, good God, she knows it too! Am I awake?
19142	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Clock. Edwards, here, is at best just a few minutes away from walking towards the light, so what's say you stop wasting our time and give me your professional opinion.
19143	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, sometimes friends will surprise you.
19144	Molly	Mr. Phillips' numerous relapses paint the picture of someone who has not overcome his addictions, sooo, no, I don't think he will.
19145	Elliot	Karaoke's so off!
19146	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19147	Molly	Look, I know you're mad.
19148	Elliot	Why? Because you betrayed me? Betrayer.
19149	Molly	Look, I'm sorry, but when they asked me for my professional opinion, I had to give it.
19150	Elliot	Oh, I don't know, if you were a real friend you could have lied, kept your mouth shut, made out with me any of the stuff that we talked about!
19151	Todd	Did I just hear?
19152	Molly	Todd!Look, I really want to work this out, but I have to see this schizophrenic patient, and it's already six.
19153	Elliot	No, Molly, it's three! You're still on stupid Greenland time!
19154	Molly	Oh, shoot, I forgot to call my mom in Yergi.

19156	J.D.'s Narration	I know I bailed on Mr. Daniels, but the whole having not killed thing got in my head. Still, no one will notice.
19157	Dr. Cox	Ah! Kiki Dee! I heard Mr. Daniels isn't getting his periocardiocentesis. Since when?
19158	J.D.'s Thoughts	Now you're gonna lie here. Don't be too specific!
19159	J.D.	Since 1:42 yesterday afternoon. His wife did not want him to do it. She's beautiful, by the way one green eye, one blue. She's from Luxembourg. They're both from Luxembourg. I believe they're, uh, Luxem...bourgian.
19160	Dr. Cox	Where in Luxembourg? I-I spent two weeks there.
19161	J.D.'s Thoughts	What are the odds? Just stay vague.
19162	J.D.	Uh, outside Mertert, near the German border.
19163	Dr. Cox	Ah.
19164	J.D.	They say what they miss most are those lazy summer afternoons on the Moselle River.
19165	J.D.'s Thoughts	You are channeling that seventh grade book report!
19166	Dr. Cox	Okay. Okay, then.
19167	J.D.'s Thoughts	Bullet dodged! He totally bought it! Hey, where's he taking me?
19168	Dr. Cox	Mr. Daniels. We have rethought things and decided that you should have that procedure.
19169	Mr. Daniels	Okay.
19170	Dr. Cox	I know that took quite a bit of cajoling, but I think I was able to convince him.
19171	J.D.'s Narration	That's okay. 'Cause I wasn't the only one lying around here.
19172	Turk	Hey. Baby. I'm gonna head home and watch some television with Rowdy.
19173	Carla	Rowdy? NO! Um, you shouldn't go home.
19174	Turk	Why?
19175	Carla	I need you to go somewhere for me.
19176	Turk	Okay.
19177	J.D.	Hey, Turk, can I talk to you for a second?
19178	Turk	Can't talk now, good stuff's happenin'!
19179	J.D.	Can I talk to you for a second?
19180	Guy	Don't care!
19181	Carla	Where, where am I gonna find a dead stuffed yellow lab?
19182	Janitor	I can help.
19183	Carla	No, you have work to do.
19184	Janitor	Let's go.
19185	Carla	NO!!!
19186	Janitor	Okay. I just needed to know where the line was.Helloo. Wrong place, wrong time, little buddy.Fellas, I'd like you all to meet...Kyle. Welcome him, treat him as a brother. You'll enjoy it here. Any complaints, go to Duane. Umm, what've we got on the table. Greg, may I run the meeting? Is that cool? Okay.
19187	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19188	Elliot	Well, I guess I was a little more persuasive than I thought. You got the heart valve!
19189	Mr. Phillips	Oh! That's amazing!We have to celebrate. How do you celebrate without heroin?
19190	Elliot	Uh, with cake mostly.
19191	Mr. Phillips	Then let's score some cake.
19192	Elliot	And, Mr. Phillips, part of the deal here is that you'll come back for the next six weeks for drug rehab.
19193	Mr. Phillips	Absolutely. Not a problem. I'm real good at rehab!But after that, I'm gonna move my family down to Florida. Start fresh, you know?
19194	Elliot	Yeah.
19195	Molly	Hey! Did somebody page me? I'm sorry I took so long, I was just eating lunch.
19196	Elliot	Oh, of course you were! It's 8:30 in the morning! Just wanted to let you know that the committee voted in my favor.
19197	Molly	Congratulations!
19198	Elliot	Thank you.
19199	Molly	Well, I was congratulating Dean.
19200	Elliot	Uh, why?
19201	Molly	He got a new heart valve.
19202	Elliot	Oh, right. She voted against you!
19203	Molly	Can I talk to you outside?Did you just page me so you could rub my face in this?
19204	Elliot	Yes. Uh, there's also a couple of messages on your home machine.
19205	Molly	Look, Elliot, I hope I'm wrong, and I hope he stays clean. Let's just not make this personal, okay?
19206	Elliot	Said the loser. Who lost.
19207	Molly	Don't push me. 'Cause one of the reasons I became a therapist is I've always been able to zero in on a person's greatest insecurity.
19208	Elliot	Ohhh, I'm real scared, Molly, what'cha gonna
19209	Molly	Eyebrows.
19210	J.D.	"Eyebrows." Like that's gonna make youElliot, come on, you can't be that insecure.
19211	Elliot	Giant Adam's apple!
19212	J.D.	I have to go.
19213	J.D.'s Narration	Elliot's comment didn't bother me, because I'm proud of the body God gave me.Besides, I had bigger problems. I had to do Mr. Daniels' procedure. Luckily I'm a professional, and professionals finish the job.
19214	J.D.	This needle is too sticky! I'm out! Get it together, Laverne!
19215	Dr. Cox	Hey, Peggy? Yes, I noticed the turtleneck choice in August, and can only assume it's got something to do with that grapefruit you store in your trachea. Let me put your mind at ease: You've killed before.
19216	J.D.	Who?
19217	Dr. Cox	Do you remember Mrs. Carter?
19218	J.D.	Whoa. Bye-bye.
19219	Mrs. Carter	Wahoooo!
19220	J.D.	She died?
19221	Dr. Cox	Three days ago of endocarditis. You didn't get blood cultures and you missed it. You happy?
19222	J.D.'s Narration	The weird thing was that I was a little happy.
19223	J.D.	Sticky needle please!
19224	Nurse Roberts	Here you go, Doctor.
19225	Janitor	Psst! Where's your husband?
19226	Carla	He isn't here.
19227	Janitor	Ruff, ruff.
19228	Carla	You found Rowdy!?!
19229	Janitor	Nope. Not Rowdy. This is Steven. You know, Rowdy was 48 inches from snout to tail, Steven's only 46...on a good day.
19230	Carla	I think we're okay!
19231	Janitor	I got him off another taxidermy guy on the internet. Had to trade him my, uh, squirrel army.
19232	Carla	Oh, I'm sorry you had to do that; but thank you!
19233	Janitor	Nah. Everyone thinks squirrel armies are so great...I'm not sure it's the healthiest habit in the world.
19234	Carla	Thank you. Thank
19235	Janitor	He likes the park.
19236	Carla	Let it go. Okay.Ew. Smells like Rowdy.
19237	Janitor	He's Steven.

19239	J.D.'s Narration	Killing Mrs. Carter, though admittedly bad for her, was just the pick-me-up I needed.
19240	Mrs. Carter	I don't know how my car ended up in the community pool.
19241	Nurse Roberts	You musta lost control after you went through the snack bar.
19242	Mrs. Carter	Mmm.
19243	J.D.'s Thoughts	Mrs. Carter?
19244	Dr. Cox	Ooh, did I trick Newbie? I did, didn't I!
19245	J.D.	You know what, I don't appreciate lying.
19246	Dr. Cox	Come on. I know you're scared. A lot of times you feel like a little girl in a big gal's body. But here's the dirty little secret: Fear is good. It keeps you from becoming a crappy doctor. Trick is you just can't let it paralyze you. But don't you worry about a thing, there, Newbie. You're a sure thing to get a kill. In fact, should be any day now!
19247	J.D.'s Narration	One of the hardest things around here is that sometimes you don't get to know how things end.
19248	Molly	What are you doing?
19249	Elliot	Oh, just waiting for Mr. Phillips. He, uh, showed up the first couple of days, but he's missed his last three rehab appointments.
19250	Molly	I'll wait with you.
19251	Elliot	Thanks.
19252	Molly	They look really good.
19253	J.D.'s Narration	...Whether it's wondering if your husband will realize you replaced his dead dog with a shorter replica......Or wondering when and if you're gonna kill that first person.
19254	J.D.	Okay, everybody, watch closely, because if you're not careful, you can cause a pneumothorax.
19255	J.D.'s Narration	Ultimately it'll drive you crazy if you don't have a friend to help you through it.
19256	Molly	You know, he might have gone to Florida early. Maybe he's going to a hospital down there.
19257	Elliot	You think?
19258	Molly	I don't know. Maybe.
19259	Elliot	Okay, there is no way I'm following that guy. I don't even have my cape.
19260	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19261	J.D.'s Narration	Even though I was already an amazing doctor, when I became chief resident I decided to add a little something extra to my repertoire. A "hook," if you will.
19262	J.D.	Mrs. MacCalla, 40s, moderately attractive, condition improving.
19263	Mrs. MacCalla	Did you just say I was moderately attractive?
19264	J.D.	Excuse me, Mrs. MacCalla.
19265	Carla	Where'd you get the idea for the stupid tape recorder?
19266	Turk's Recorder	Dude, I love your new tape recorder.
19267	Carla	You two are idiots!
19268	J.D.	Come on, Carla, I wanted a hook and I only had one other idea.Mr. Hawkins, the results of your tests are back, and you have
19269	Parrot	Liver disease! Liver disease!
19270	J.D.	Sorry, that's all he can say. Anyway, you don't have liver disease you have inoperable lung cancer.
19271	Parrot	Liver disease!
19272	J.D.	If only, Chauncy.Bottom line, that tape recorder won't fly away and break your heart.
19273	Carla	I'm sorry! I'm just a little edgy because my husband woke me up again last night, and he knows once I'm up I can't go back to sleep!
19274	Turk	Baby, I was quiet last night.
19275	Carla	Great. I'm awake.
19276	Turk	Sorry about that, sweetness. Um, since you're up, I was wondering if maybe we could
19277	Carla	Are you crazy? No, Turk. But
19278	J.D.'s Tape Recorder	Gesundheit!
19279	J.D.'s Thoughts	I love my new tape recorder. Not only is it a time-saver, I can record my every thought.
19280	J.D.	I like toast.
19281	J.D.'s Thoughts	They aren't all winners. Still, as long as I have this thing, I don't need to be in my head so much.
19282	Elliot	Excuse me! Heh!
19283	Elliot's Thoughts	Why did I say "excuse me"? He bumped in to me! I have to stop doing that.
19284	Elliot	Excuse me!
19285	Elliot's Thoughts	Frick!
19286	Molly	Hey, I got you a blueberry muffin, but I know you don't like blueberries, so I picked them all out.
19287	Elliot	Oh!
19288	Elliot's Thoughts	A lot of people think Molly's a little off, but I totally get her. She's like the big sister I always wanted. She makes me feel better about myself.
19289	Molly	They're so not finger-toes. I mean, these are finger-toes. Yours are cute like french fries.
19290	Elliot	Really? Yeah!
19291	Elliot's Thoughts	She looks after me.
19292	Elliot	Agh! Sorry! Sorry!
19293	Elliot's Thoughts	She makes me do things I don't normally do.She's the Peppermint Patty to my Marcy you know, minus the thick glasses and the strong lesbian vibe.
19294	J.D.	Half of what rappers say doesn't make any sense. Like that Snoop Dogg-Dr. Dre song? What does "still hittin' them corners and those ho-hos girl" mean?
19295	Turk	Many disadvantaged African-Americans have limited nutritional choices, therefore they must subsist on Ho-Ho snack cakes. It's a black thing, bro.
19296	Molly	Actually, Turk, it's "still hittin' them corners and them 'lo-los' girls." Lo-los, not ho-hos.
19297	Elliot	See, Turk, in the 'hood, a lo-lo is a lowrider, or a car with an adjusted suspension that allows it to bounce up and down.And Dre and Snoop enjoy driving around together in their lowriders around the corners, or lizzle-rizzles.I'm representin' for them gangtas all across the world!
19298	Molly	Still hittin' them corners and them lo-los girls!
19299	Elliot	Still
19300	Carla	Turk! You just got schooled on rap by the two whitest chicks in America!
19301	Turk	None of you can prove it!
19302	J.D.	I got it on tape.
19303	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19304	Elliot's Thoughts	There's Dr. Kelso. Okay, you're chief resident now, so say hi. But don't stop, or you'll have to come up with something else to say, and you know you don't improvise well.
19305	Elliot	Hi, Dr. Kelso!
19306	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Reid.
19307	Elliot	I see you've trimmed your nose hair!
19308	Elliot's Thoughts	Frick on a stick!Molly's nervous because her boyfriend's in town.
19309	Molly	You know, Mike's kind of private, so when we go out to dinner, just pretend I never told you any of that personal stuff.
19310	Elliot	Gotcha.
19311	Elliot's Thoughts	Mike's got a curved peep.
19312	Elliot	Whoa!
19313	Janitor	Whoa, whoa, whoa...whoa, watch your step, there, little lady!
19314	Elliot	Thanks, Janitor!
19315	Elliot's Thoughts	He is so sweet! But why doesn't he just put up a sign that says "wet floor"?
19316	J.D.	Aaaaaaaaaaaaagh!
19317	Janitor	Wet floor.
19318	J.D.	Sorry I'm late! I was recording some thoughts and I slipped and fell.
19319	Dr. Cox	Gimme this!
19320	J.D.'s Tape Recorder	Possible nicknames for Dr. Cox when we become best friends: The Coxinator. Cox of Seagulls. Hooooooog!
19321	Elliot's Thoughts	Here it comes. Another condescending rant about how we suck at our jobs.
19322	Dr. Cox	Since you two have become chief residents, I've noticed that your leadership skills are how can I put this delicately? eh...crap.
19323	J.D.	Oh, sir, I don't know about that. Some people say I'm
19324	Elliot	That is so not nice!
19325	Dr. Cox	Well, then, why don't you go ahead and get that young resident back there to come up here?
19326	J.D.	Easy. Lonnie?
19327	Lonnie	Not right now!Yessir?
19328	Dr. Cox	Slap yourself very hard in the face, then leave.Anyway, one of you two is going to speak at grand rounds today.
19329	Elliot's Thoughts	And here comes the part where he throws me to the wolves to protect his little protégé.
19330	Dr. Cox	...meenie, miney....aha...moe. Barbie, you're up.
19331	Elliot's Thoughts	Perfect.
19332	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19333	Turk	Our TV's working. Why are you reading?
19334	J.D.	Oh, I'm researching some leadership techniques for my residents.
19335	Turk	Well, you're better off watching good ol' Papa Smurf, here! Yeah, he says leadership boils down to three things: Smurferation, Smurferation, Smurf.
19336	J.D.	"Preparation, Inspiration, and Fear"?
19337	Turk	You know it.
19338	J.D.	Ooh, are we playing pillow feet again?
19339	Turk	I'm not waking Carla tonight.
19340	Carla	Turk.
19341	Turk	I'm sorry, baby.
19342	Carla	Yes!That's it. From now on, you and I are going to bed at the same time.
19343	Turk	Okay, that's fine.
19344	Carla	No, Turk! I can't believe that you
19345	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19346	Elliot's Thoughts	Oh, my God. How does she eat like that and stay so thin? If I didn't love her so much, I'd totally spread rumors that she's bulimic.
19347	Molly	So how's it going?
19348	Elliot	I'm freaking out about grand rounds today because Dr. Cox hung me out to dry again.
19349	Molly	You'll be fine. Just do what I do: Fake it till you make it.
19350	Elliot	Like when a guy is really bad in bed and you pretend that he is awesome so he doesn't go to a special store, buy one of those weird pumps, and then accidentally run into your dad?
19351	Molly	Kind of....
19352	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19353	Elliot's Thoughts	Wow!
19354	Molly	'Scuse me. Yeah, those are my boobs.
19355	Dr. Kelso	Ah, yes, medical care for crazy homeless people. Sounds like a money-maker.
19356	Molly	You know it's a good idea!
19357	Elliot's Thoughts	As I watched Molly shielding her boobs and working her magic, I realized she wasn't just my friend she's the mentor I've always been looking for.
19358	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19359	J.D.	Always make sure the I.V...
19360	Turk	Check out my man getting his leadership on!
19361	J.D.	Are there any more questions about evolving treatment therapies?
19362	Turk	Next, inspiration.
19363	J.D.	Now, I just want you to know, you guys all have the potential to be amazing doctors.
19364	Turk	And finally, a dose of fear.
19365	J.D.	M'kay, I'll see you guys.AAAAGGGHHH!!!
19366	Residents	Agh!
19367	J.D.	AAAGGGHHH!
19368	Residents	Agh!
19369	J.D.	AGH!
19370	Residents	Agh!
19371	Turk	Okay, fear might need a little work, but otherwise Smurftastic!

19377	Carla	Turk! It's bedtime.
19378	Turk	Baby, when you said we'd go to sleep at the same time, I thought you meant you'd stay up until I went to sleep.
19379	Carla	Turk. That's crazy talk!
19380	Turk	The guys are here and it's the ninth inning!

19383	Dr. Cox	How, uh, how old is this patient?
19384	Elliot	Seventy-nine.
19385	Dr. Cox	Uh-huh. And...how old would you say he was when you started this procedure?
19386	Elliot's Thoughts	The more I thought about how awesome Molly is, the more I got sick of Dr. Cox's crap.
19387	Dr. Cox	Oh my God, I could fly to China, adopt a child, raise her and send her to medical school, and then train her to do this procedure in the time it's taking you to finish.
19388	Elliot's Thoughts	Enough! He's never been there for you! Burn this bridge once and for all!
19389	Dr. Cox	Barbie, honest to God, if you
19390	Elliot	You know what, Dr. Cox? I have so had it with this whole macho alpha-male thing, and I have heard every tired, recycled put-down you have in you. So, from now on, save your stupid lessons for someone who gives a frick, because honestly, I don't even wanna see you or the stupid poodle perm of yours unless it's walking away from me.
19391	Elliot's Thoughts	God, that felt great! Huh. Hopefully it won't have ramifications for anyone else.
19392	J.D.	I'm feeling so good today!I still feel good, 'cause nobody saw me fall!That sound you're hearing is my residents' respect. It feels good.
19393	Dr. Cox	GLORIA! You're supposed to start pre-rounds at 7 o'clock. It's now 7:03.
19394	J.D.	I'm sorry I'm late, but I was singing and I fell. And I know I've used the falling excuse before, but it happened again!
19395	Dr. Cox	Look! I know the only thing you've ever been responsible for was picking which Duran Duran cover band would play at your sorority formal, but you're supposed to be teaching these kids. So how's about you learn how to walk, ditch the tape recorder, and act like you got a pair!
19396	Lonnie	Ha-ha!
19397	J.D.	Kill Lonnie.
19398	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19399	Elliot's Thoughts	I felt great after telling Dr. Cox off. Why? Because I knew I had someone to support me, someone to look up to, someone pretty amazing.
19400	Todd	Wow! That outfit would look better on my floor.
19401	Wonder Molly	Mistake!
19402	Todd	Ohh! No! Not the Lasso of Truth!I once had a threesome and not the cool kind!
19403	Wonder Molly	Mmm-hmm.
19404	Molly	Hey! Uh, we gotta do the dinner another night.
19405	Elliot	How come?
19406	Molly	Well, Mike got up early this morning and he wanted to read the paper, and I don't get it, so then he went to the neighbors', and they don't get it either, so he broke into their garage and stole their car and wrapped it around a telephone pole.
19407	Elliot	Oh my God, is he okay?
19408	Mike	I've been better.
19409	Molly	Oh, sorry. Mike, Elliot. Elliot, Mike.
19410	Elliot	Ohh, that's great!
19411	Molly	I'll be right in.Elliot, I'm sorry
19412	Elliot	Ah, you don't have to say anything I know all about how it is when you think a guy is great and he ends up being a car thief.
19413	Molly	Well, you know, relationships are never perfect, and...and Mike's got a lot of potential. He's got the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen.
19414	Elliot's Thoughts	Oh my God, my mentor's a crazy person!
19415	Mike	Molly!
19416	Molly	Coming, babe!
19417	Elliot	Yeah! Heh.
19418	Elliot's Thoughts	Watching Molly, I found myself asking the same questions I always do. Did I line up behind the wrong person?Am I too much of a wimp?
19419	Announcer	Oh my God! What a catch!
19420	Elliot's Thoughts	Will people around here ever respect me?
19421	J.D.	Guys? Guys. Guys!
19422	Elliot's Thoughts	Unfortunately I had closed the door on the creep who used to occasionally give me answers. I just had to hope that I hadn't closed it for good.
19423	Elliot	Uh, Dr. Cox, do you have a sec?
19424	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19425	Molly	It's gonna be okay, sweetie.
19426	Elliot's Thoughts	As I watched Molly gently stroke the hand of a convicted felon, I had to admit his eyes were stunning. Still, I couldn't help but think what the next few years would be like if she was my mentor.
19427	Molly	The police caught this guy robbing a liquor store. His tox-screen came back positive for methamphetamines and cocaine.
19428	Elliot	Okay, what should I do?
19429	Molly	Oh my God, make out with him immediately! He's such a catch!

19434	J.D.	See, there's no fear! Can you help a brother out?
19435	Turk	Dude, I've got my own problems! I've got a bedtime again! I haven't had a bedtime in like twelve years!
19436	J.D.	You had a bedtime when you were seventeen?
19437	Turk	No! Not every night. On the weekends I didn't have to be in bed by 11, but I had to be in my room.
19438	J.D.	Oh. That's way cooler.
19439	Turk	The point is Carla's setting some kind of record on being a major pain in the ass, and I can't help you.
19440	J.D.'s Tape Recorder	Carla's setting some kind of record on being a major pain the ass, and I can't help you.
19441	Turk	Okay, here's what you do....
19442	Elliot's Thoughts	Okay, you can't bend that way anymore, 'cause when you do, that last vertebrae above your butt sticks out and makes you look like a prehistoric camel.
19443	Carla	What are you thinking?
19444	Elliot	Same ol', same ol'.
19445	Carla	Camel-butt?
19446	Elliot	Yeah....
19447	Molly	Hey, Carla, can you warn everyone that Mike gets a little handsy when he's on the pain-killers?
19448	Carla	Dr. Vaji already told us.
19449	Dr. Vaji	It was horrible.
19450	Elliot	Ohh.
19451	Molly	Um, Elliot, do you wanna grab some lunch?
19452	Elliot	Oh, um, I'm sorry, I can't. I'm, uh, busy.
19453	Molly	Okay.
19454	Elliot's Thoughts	I felt bad, but it was time to start pulling away.

19456	J.D.	Dr. Cox?
19457	Dr. Cox	Hold on.
19458	Dr. Kelso	No.
19459	Dr. Cox	We didn't order any of the pain in the ass.
19460	J.D.	You yelled at me in front of my residents!
19461	Dr. Cox	I didn't yell at ya.
19462	J.D.'s Tape Recorder	So how's about you learn to walk, ditch the tape recorder, and act like you got a pair!
19463	Dr. Kelso	I'll let you two talk.Oh, and Perry, I would be remiss if I didn't tell you that earlier I wish I'd said, "I must have ordered the pain in the ass, seeing as you're sitting there."
19464	Dr. Cox	Here I was thinking the same thing, Bob. Let's do this again.Tell you what, there, Gidget, if you promise to leave right now, I won't yell at you in front of your peons anymore.
19465	J.D.	You ruined my credibility! Now look me in the eyes and tell me that's not messed up!
19466	Dr. Cox	Fair enough. Later on today when you are with your residents, I'll come up for something, you'll tell me you're too busy in a manly way, and I will contritely turn around and walk out of the room with my tail between my legs. Problem solved.
19467	J.D.	Can you pull off contrite?
19468	Dr. Cox	Can you pull off manly way?
19469	J.D.	Should have seen that coming.

19471	Carla	Oh, hey, Turk, would you pour me a cup of decaf, please? We gotta go to bed early tonight.
19472	Dr. Kelso	I'll have some of that decaf, son!
19473	Turk	Sir, see, this is regular. Yeah, I gotta give Carla the strong stuff just to keep her awake so I can stay up a little later.
19474	Dr. Kelso	Ahh, drugging your own wife. Been there.
19475	Turk	Mm.
19476	Dr. Kelso	Careful, though. Starts out with coffee, next thing you know, you're rooting around the nightstand for an adrenaline shot to counteract a Valium overdose.
19477	Turk	Your coffee, my love.
19478	Carla	Thank you, my husband.

19482	Dr. Cox	Hey, camel-butt!I heard you and Carla talking earlier.
19483	Elliot's Thoughts	Frick on a stick with a brick! Just leave.
19484	Dr. Cox	Oh, whoa, now. What happened to what happened to feisty Barbie, huh? You know, it took me a helluva lot to shake off that tongue-lashing you gave me yesterday.
19485	Elliot	Yeah, well, yesterday I had a mentor, but she turned out to be insane. I mean, how am I supposed to take professional advice from somebody who can't even hold together their personal life?
19486	Dr. Cox	Look, I know you and I have never really connected maybe that's because you're relentlessly annoying, or maybe it's my fault because I can't tolerate relentlessly annoying people I don't know. But answer me one question: Do you think I'm a good teacher?
19487	Elliot	To some people.
19488	Dr. Cox	Fair enough. Why don't we go ahead and take a look at my personal life? I am in love with a woman that I hate, my two-year-old son calls me "Pewwy," and this is something that I've never actually shared with anybody before, but on Saturday nights, I like to throw on a nice dress, go out to dive bars, and insist that everybody call me Mrs. Haberdasher!
19489	Elliot	No, you don't.
19490	Dr. Cox	Well, even if I did, it wouldn't really matter since that has nothing to do with how good of a teacher I am. Stick with me here, Barbie. The point is that if you finally found somebody who makes you believe in yourself as much as you did yesterday, well, I would think twice before I wrote that person off.
19491	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19492	J.D.	Okay, everybody, gather around please?
19493	Dr. Cox	Newbie, I need to talk to you?
19494	J.D.	I'm a little busy right now, Perry!
19495	Dr. Cox	Oh. My fault, I'll come back later.
19496	J.D.	Oh, and another thing.From now on, I'd prefer it if you'd address me as "Dr. Dorian."
19497	Dr. Cox	Are you really doing this?
19498	J.D.	You bet your ass I am.
19499	Dr. Cox	Wrap it up, there, bingo.
19500	J.D.	I simply will not tolerate it, Perry! And neither will my boys!
19501	Dr. Cox	The next minute you find yourself alone, I'm gonna kill ya.
19502	J.D.	It was worth it.Lonnie, slap the face!All of you, slap your faces!Awesome.

19504	Carla	Mm? Wha? Wha? Oooh. It's morning already?
19505	Turk	No. But I could see how you'd think that, being that it's light out and we're in bed.
19506	Carla	Okay.
19507	Turk	Really, that quick?
19508	Carla	I love it when you're all "my woman this, my woman that."
19509	Turk	That's what's up.Goodnight.
19510	Carla	Mm-mm.
19511	Turk	Mmm. We're keepin' the lights on?
19512	Carla	Oh, yeah.
19513	Turk	Oh, yeah! Ohh!
19514	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19515	Elliot	Hey, Molly? I was just wondering if I could get your advice on something. You know, if you're not too busy with Mike.
19516	Molly	Oh, actually we decided to take a little break.
19517	Elliot	How long?
19518	Molly	Two-to-five years.
19519	Elliot	Ah! Heh!
19520	Molly	I freaked you out a little bit with him, didn't I?
19521	Elliot	Hm. I try not to judge.
19522	Molly	I know I should know better, I'm a shrink. But show me a guy who wants to get married and has a good job, and it's like snoozeville for me. But if you know a thirty-five-year-old who still lives at home with his mom and he still thinks his band can make it, tell me where to meet him so I can buy him dinner!
19523	Elliot's Thoughts	Listening to Molly made me realize a person doesn't have to be perfect to be exactly what you need.
19524	Elliot	Yeah, I've dated some pretty immature guys, too.
19525	J.D.	Hello, tiny ladies! I don't believe we've met! I'm the world's most giant doctor! Nice to
19526	J.D.'s Narration	As I watched Elliot and Molly walk off, and thought about how Lonnie was a much less stable giant doctor base than Turk, I realized how important it is to have someone close to you that you can count on.
19527	J.D.	Whoooagh! Ow! Lonnie! Damn you!
19528	J.D.'s Narration	Especially if that someone is a resident that can keep Dr. Cox from killing you.
19529	J.D.	Not in front of my boys! This is Lonnie! He's one of my boys!Not sure what that means. See you later.
19530	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes you have to keep people closer than you'd like.
19531	Carla	That was too easy. No way I'm doing that seven nights a week.
19532	J.D.'s Narration	In my case, it was best just to keep my distance.
19533	Dr. Cox	Can I have a word with you?Go.
19534	J.D.'s Thoughts	I wonder if we're going to a happy place?
19535	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19536	J.D.'s Narration	Working at Sacred Heart, you grow accustomed to a lot of things. Sickness, death Ted's morning self-affirmation ritual.
19537	Ted	People are laughing with you! People are laughing with you. People are laughing... ... with... you.
19538	J.D.'s Narration	One thing Turk couldn't get accustomed to was his wife being friends with a psychiatrist.
19539	Carla	Babe, what do you want for lunch today?
19540	Turk	Baby, please, not in front of her.
19541	Molly	Turk, why are you not comfortable around me?
19542	Turk	You have the ability to get in people's heads. And I don't want you to take this negatively or anything like that, but that makes you a Devil Woman.
19543	Molly	Please, I mean, who could imagine what it's like in your head?
19544	J.D.'s Thoughts	I'll take this one.
19545	Carla	Hey, welcome to Turk's head. You look really hot.
19546	Molly	Wait a second, you're not a lesbian.
19547	Carla	I am in here.
19548	Molly	Yeah, me too.
19549	J.D.	Dammit! Molly, you're a shrink: why is it my daydreams always end right before the sexy part.
19550	Molly	I don't know, maybe we should work on that... together.
19551	J.D.	Dammit!
19552	Turk	Dude! Relax... and enjoy hot chocolate love.
19553	J.D.'s Thoughts	Snap out of it! Abort! ABORT!
19554	J.D.	Stop it! I don't have gay jungle fever!!!
19555	Turk	Okay, we should go.

19558	J.D.	Hey, uh, Mr. Garcia's family is here.
19559	Dr. Cox	Fantastic.
19560	J.D.'s Narration	Telling a family their loved one has died is never easy. That's why doctors have a variety of techniques for breaking the news. There's the hand on shoulder...... there's hand on hand...And, of course, the always popular Resident Kabuki Theater.
19561	J.D.	I'm sorry for your loss.

19563	J.D.'s Narration	As for my family, we had our own way of breaking the news.
19564	Dan	Hey, little brother!
19565	J.D.'s Narration	We did it with cake.
19566	J.D.	What happened?
19567	Dan	What, a guy can't take three days off work, travel eight hundred miles on a bus with a double-layer fudge cake just to say "Hey, how're things?"
19568	J.D.	Dan.
19569	Dan	Dad died.

19572	SUBTITLE	10 Days Later.
19573	Turk	You guys are back. Sorry I had to blow out of there after the funeral, but how was the rest of the week?
19574	J.D.	It was all right; we spent most of the time dealing with the headstone problem. See, since Dad was an office supplies salesman, he wanted it to be shaped like a pencil.
19575	Turk	So?
19576	Dan	So, it looked like a giant marble penis which I maintain, Dad would have liked even more.
19577	Turk	How you doing, buddy?
19578	J.D.	I don't know... it hasn't really hit me yet.
19579	Dan	Oh, it will eventually. But don't worry when it does, Big Bro' will be there.What? What is it?
19580	J.D.	Dan, I love you, but being there for people isn't really yo' thang.
19581	Dan	No, that was Old Dan. Look at me: this is New Dan! I'm totally here for you.
19582	J.D.	Dan, you've been in here for, like, nine hours: you okay?
19583	Dan	Well, I'd feel a lot better if you could give that ol' "H"-knob there a little twist. Body temp's a bit low.Ahh. Now I can feel my tootsies.

19585	Dr. Kelso	So, what do you think of the new convertible, Ted?
19586	Ted	Why don't I have one of these?
19587	Janitor	Well, howdy, Dr. Kelso. Ain't she a beaut'? I rented her so I could repair the air conditioning unit.
19588	Dr. Kelso	Looks expensive, who authorised it?
19589	Janitor	Why, you did, sir. Must have been Tuesday last.
19590	Dr. Kelso	Stop talking like a farmer! I did no such thing. Now I'm not sure how one would go about making a janitor's life even more miserable, but what say we start by docking your pay for the cost of this monstrosity.

19596	Carla	Mmmhmm.
19597	Turk	I'd love to go out with her again if you'll pay for it.
19598	Carla	Buppy.
19599	Turk	Uh? What?
19600	Carla	We've been looking all over for you.
19601	Turk	why? What did I miss?
19602	Chuck	Bye Carla. I'm sorry I didn't get to meet your husband.
19603	Carla	Oh, I know.
19604	Molly	So, Mr. Woolery: what have you been doing since 'The Love Connection' was cancelled?
19605	Chuck	'Love Connection' was never cancelled, it's just not on TV anymore. I still do the occasional episode in my basement with singles from the neighbourhood. I'm not crazy.
19606	Carla	Noo! Heh.
19607	Turk	Aww, stupid nap! I been a little sleepy these last couple of weeks, I've dropped a few pounds. I don't know, I think I've got the 'flu, baby.
19608	Carla	No!
19609	Turk	Yeah.
19610	Carla	You're not allowed to get sick, you're my "Superman." I mean, if you're in bed, who's going to give me my back rubs, or unscrew the peanut butter jar, or... walk around all day in my new high heels just to stretch them out.
19611	Turk	She's kidding! I've never done that. Not in front of the Devil Woman.

19618	J.D.	You know, it wasn't exactly easy showering with you in there.
19619	Dan	Well, it wasn't exactly easy for me, either. You have Dad's butt.
19620	J.D.	You think you'll get out of the tub today?
19621	Dan	Yeah, today doesn't look good by the way, could you get me another beer?
19622	J.D.	No, look, I put a six-pack for you in the toilet.
19623	Dan	Ooh.
19624	J.D.	I gotta go to work!

19629	Ted	It still won't smooth down!
19630	Dr. Kelso	He's not a day over fifty-five and he has Alzheimer's. Really makes you think, doesn't it?
19631	Janitor	You're over fifty-five, aren't you, sir?
19632	Dr. Kelso	What's your point?
19633	Janitor	Nothing.
19634	J.D.'s Narration	Even though I deal with death every time I walk into this place, I never dealt with it from this side before. It's full of surprises, whether it's a small gesture from a co-worker...... or a big gesture from someone you've never even met before.
19635	Chuck	Walk tall, kiddo.
19636	J.D.'s Narration	... although sometimes, it's a little awkward, even with an old friend.

19643	Elliot	'Kay.
19644	J.D.	'Kay.
19645	Dr. Cox	Say, Barbie, for a second there, I thought you were being a little bit cold, but then you really saved it with the "... 'Kay."
19646	Elliot	What are you going to do, hide from him all day and then call him "Ginger"?
19647	Dr. Cox	No. It's Monday, which of course means it's Ethnic Day, so I'll be going with Rosalita, and besides, I have a plan.
19648	Elliot	Which is?
19649	Dr. Cox	Yeah, unfortunately, the first part of the plan is not to share it with people who annoy me. Want to hear the second part?
19650	Elliot	Sure.
19651	Dr. Cox	I can't. My hands are tied by the first part.

19655	Carla	Dont' you think it's weird you've already gone seven times today?
19656	Turk	I think it's weird you're counting.
19657	Carla	It's impossible to get a doctor to go see a doctor!
19658	Molly	I'm on it!
19659	Turk	Excuse me: did somebody say they're looking for the baddest detective in town?
19660	Molly	Awesome afro.I'm sorry to barge in on you, but I'm a little rusty on the medicine side, and I was wondering if you could help me. See, I have this patient constantly tired, always peeing, losing weight.
19661	Turk	You should have him checked out, he might have diabetes.Oh.
19662	Dr. Kim	The good news is that it's Type II diabetes. It's still serious, but it's totally manageable.

19668	J.D.	Okay.
19669	Carla	He bought it.
19670	Dr. Cox	Great. Great, great, great, great. I took all his patients, and I threatened every single one of his residents under the penalty of death not to page him. One last thing to do.
19671	Dan	What is this?
19672	Dr. Cox	That's your basic homemade anti-drowning device, to be worn until your brother returns.

19684	J.D.	Oh, thaaank you.Hey, Dan, if Dad were here right now, what would you say to him?I think he'd be glad to hear that.
19685	J.D.'s Narration	Maybe it was because I finally slowed down, maybe it was remembering Dad's passion for bodily functions, I don't know. But at that moment, it all hit me. Unfortunately, I'm not sure Dan's the guy to talk about it with.
19686	Dan	Slow down, little duck. Some ducks can't hold their water. It's okay. I know.
19687	J.D.'s Narration	There's a lot in life that can let you down.It can be your mind...... or your body...

19697	J.D.	Really? Not even just like two seconds to talk to me.
19698	Dr. Cox	Look, Newbie. Oh, for God's sake. I'm a little swamped, here. Thank you.
19699	J.D.	You know what sucks? I thought you were actually going to come through for me this time.
19700	Dr. Cox	In a minute! Hey, Newbie? Just in case you didn't actually notice, I have been covering all your patients, answering all your pages, and doing pretty much everything shy of picking up your sundress from the drycleaners.
19701	J.D.	Well, I didn't ask you to do any of that, did I?
19702	Dr. Cox	Outstanding! You're walking away like a pissy little ingrate. I mean, bravo! Bravo, ah!

19709	Dr. Cox	What do you want me to do, anyway?
19710	Elliot	Be more sensitive. Try giving him a hug.
19711	Dr. Cox	Barbie... you've met be before, yes? Now, at most, I can muster one hug a year, and nine months ago I hugged my son, so: you're gonna have to do it.
19712	Elliot	Um, you saw us before, we're still awkward from the break-up.
19713	Dr. Cox	H Hold the phone: are you suggesting that if I sleep with him, that I won't have to deal with problems like this? Because I'm seriously considering taking that hit. I mean, honestly, what is he like in post-game? Is there spooning? Because I don't spoon, I'm not a spooner.

19721	J.D.	So now you're making fun of me because I need a little help getting through this?
19722	Dr. Cox	No, I'm I'm really trying.
19723	J.D.	You know what, I am sick of getting dumped on, and I am sick of you!

19725	J.D.	Oh, really, why not?
19726	Dr. Cox	Because whenever anyone shoves me more than twice, my mind goes blank and all I see is this white-hot flash of fury.
19727	J.D.	When someone shoves you like this?
19728	Elliot	So, how'd it go?
19729	Dr. Cox	Punched him in the face.
19730	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19731	Turk	Do you want me to kick his ass?
19732	J.D.	No need. I already got him back, and then some.
19733	Turk	On the window, huh?
19734	J.D.	Uh, yeah!
19735	Carla	Here we go.
19736	J.D.	Oh, God, who died?
19737	Carla	No, it's for Turk! Get you some milk?
19738	Turk	Yeah!
19739	J.D.	What's the occasion?
19740	Turk	I... have type II diabetes.
19741	J.D.	Really?
19742	Turk	Yeah.
19743	J.D.	That sucks. Carla is aware that if you eat that your foot will fall off, right?
19744	Turk	Well, I haven't told her yet. But I'm pretty sure she knows, 'cause right now she's trying to get me to 'fess up by tempting her Chocolatey Goodness with chocolatey goodness.
19745	Carla	Babe? Do you want some hot fudge sugar sauce?
19746	Turk	Oh, hell yeah!
19747	J.D.	Why haven't you told her?
19748	Turk	I'm not sure. Can I tell you something weird, though?
19749	J.D.	You can tell me anything.
19750	Turk	I feel like your dad dying has stolen my diabetes thunder.
19751	J.D.	Oh my God, just this second I was thinking your diabetes is gonna get in the way of my dad dying. Isn't that funny?
19752	Turk	Cool!
19753	Dan	I smell cake!If Uncle Bernie died, someone's gonna have to go on a beer run!
19754	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19755	Dr. Kelso	Ahh!
19756	Ted	Thanks again for inviting me to your house for dinner.
19757	Dr. Kelso	I did?
19758	Ted	Yes, sir, you did.Aww!
19759	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19760	Dr. Cox	Hey! Where's your brother?
19761	Dan	J.D.!!! He's not here.
19762	Dr. Cox	Look, Dan
19763	Dan	Captain Bubblebeard. Avast, matey! Shut yer scupper and bare yer steel, we should be seeing la-AAH
19764	Dr. Cox	There. Now you're Dan again.Let's break down the kid's support system, shall we? He has me, an emotionally-crippled narcissist; and, he's got you, an emotionally-crippled narcissist who's soaking in a tub which by now has to be mostly your own urine.
19765	Dan	I believe the ratio has shifted that way, yes.
19766	Dr. Cox	And I have got to believe that the two of us, together together, Dan we can make it at least half-way to one legitimate adult.
19767	Dan	You're right, Coxy. Dammit, Coxsmith! Crybaby time is over! The kid needs us, and he needs us now, right?
19768	Dr. Cox	Towel.
19769	Dan	Thank you. Let's rock and roll!I may have lost some muscle mass in my legs.
19770	Dr. Cox	Fantastic.
19771	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19772	Turk	I want to apologize to you for that whole "Devil Woman" thing. I promise you, I will never call you that again.
19773	Molly	It's okay. I mean, I can understand why you're uncomfortable around me. I sometimes do see everyone as a patient.
19774	Turk	You know, surgeons do that, too.C'mon, let's see who's better at it. Hip replacement.
19775	Molly	Alcoholic. That was easy.
19776	Turk	Yeah.Quadruple bypass. Two on me!
19777	Molly	Constantly trying to validate herself so she'll sleep with anyone.
19778	Charice	Hey, Turk.
19779	Turk	What's up, Charice. Uh, but that, that was before Carla. So, what about me? Come on, you know you want to.
19780	Molly	Well, Carla calls you her "Superman," and you love that... but diabetes makes you feel vulnerable, and you're afraid if you're open with her about it, you won't be her Superman anymore.
19781	Turk	Yeah. Devil Woman. Sorry.
19782	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19783	J.D.	Oh my God! I'm sorry about the "Wash Me!" thing!
19784	Dr. Cox	Put that on.
19785	J.D.	Dan? You were out with him? I thought you'd dissolved.
19786	Dan	We decided this was the only way to do this without feeling incredibly uncomfortable. Drink.
19787	Dr. Cox	Now talk.
19788	J.D.	What do you want me to talk about? The pros and cons of blitzing a weak-side quarter when you're in third-and-long situations?
19789	J.D.'s Thoughts	Thank you "Football for Dummies."
19790	Dan	I gotta tell you little brother, you were always the apple of Dad's eye... you know, that's the worst thing about college football, the male cheerleaders ooh, God, that's a chick.
19791	Dr. Cox	You know, when my father died, all I could focus on was how he was never there, but you you're lucky, you've got some positive stuff you can dwell on throw the ball, Jackass!
19792	Dan	He is a jackass.
19793	Dr. Cox	I mean, I met your father, I remember it like it was yesterday. After about two seconds I could tell how proud he was of you.
19794	J.D.'s Narration	And then I heard something I thought I'd never hear.
19795	Dr. Cox	Truth be told, there, Newbie: I'm proud of you.
19796	Dan	Me too.
19797	J.D.'s Narration	It's amazing how a few simple words can change everything.Whether it's an apology...
19798	Dr. Kelso	I'm sorry I came down so hard on you. I've been a bit forgetful lately, and I suppose it's possible that I could have told you you could rent that crane.
19799	Janitor	Sir? Apology accepted.Whoa, hey! Tommy! What are you doing?
19800	Dr. Kelso	Ah, Tommy's been let go. Have a nice weekend.
19801	Janitor	You too, sir.
19802	J.D.'s Narration	... or an admission.
19803	Turk	Baby, I got diabetes.
19804	Carla	Oh no, Turk, really?
19805	Turk	Carla.
19806	Carla	I call this "Turk's Diabetes Box." Here is a recipe for sugar-free brownies: Mmm-mmm. Okay, here's a buncha articles I downloaded off the int
19807	Turk	Thank you.
19808	Carla	You're welcome.
19809	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, sometimes it's not about the words...... it's just about having someone there to listen.
19810	J.D.	And it's our dad, aand he's ranting and raving because he's an office supply salesman and he can't find a paper clip in the entire house.
19811	Dan	Meanwhile, he gets to work the next morning, and he realises he's got a million of 'em in the trunk of his car.
19812	J.D.	The trunk was filled with boxes of 'em!
19813	Dr. Cox	Here's to your dad.
19814	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19815	J.D.	Dammit! Brain Freeze is too hard. I knew I should've gone for Funny Bone.
19816	Turk	Step aside! Ahh!
19817	J.D.'s Narration	One thing I've learned is to never play Operation against a surgeon for money.
19818	Turk	Eight seconds! Is that a new record, baby?
19819	Carla	That depends, what are we talking about?
19820	J.D.	Ah-haa! Ha-haaa! Let's play again.
19821	Turk	No.
19822	J.D.	Oh, come on, if you do, I promise that every time I hit the buzzer I'll act like I'm getting electrocuted, like this:
19823	Turk	That's awesome, but no. My blood sugar's a little low.
19824	Carla	You want a cookie?
19825	J.D.'s Narration	Turk's blood sugar was low because he has Type II diabetes and hasn't figured out his medication yet.
19826	J.D.	Mmmmm, Mulattos.
19827	Carla	They're Milanos, you idiot.
19828	J.D.	I always thought that was a little bigoted for a cookie.
19829	J.D.'s Narration	Cookie racism aside, I had bigger problems. It had been three weeks since our dad died, and my brother Dan was still staying with me.
19830	Dan	Boy, nothing like a little time off to remind you how hard you been working, huh?
19831	J.D.	You bar tend three shifts a week.
19832	Dan	Two. They dropped me one for doinking the Jell-o shot girl. Hey!
19833	Elliot	Hey! Sorry I'm late.
19834	J.D.'s Narration	Since I had dumped Elliot and broke her heart, she couldn't really be there for me. But thankfully she was there for my brother.
19835	Elliot	You doing okay?
19836	Dan	I am now. You know, without Elliot, I never woulda gotten through my dad's death.
19837	J.D.	Our dad's death.
19838	Dan	Right. Air-hockey?
19839	Elliot	Mm.
19840	J.D.'s Narration	Oh, hellooo. Women are checking me out lately. Was it the ten push-ups I've been cranking out every other Sunday? Perhaps. More likely it was the pledge I made not to date anyone until Elliot did. See, since then, the gals have been all over me.
19841	Girl	Can I buy you a drink?
19842	J.D.	I'm sorry, sugar, this store is closed.
19843	J.D.'s Narration	They've been all over me.
19844	J.D.	Very impressive, but I'm sorry.
19845	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19846	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Clock, do you have a minute?
19847	Molly	Sure. I was just talking to Dr. Bromberg about switching shifts so that I can go to Mexico for my mom's wedding. I am so psyched! She is getting married to this guy that has been like a father to me since I was this big. Actually, maybe I was this big.... How tall was I in fourth grade?
19848	Dr. Kelso	It's a mystery! Now, our old hospital psychiatrist used to write my wife, Enid, a prescription for crazy pills. He was a dear, dear friend, but he died or moved or something and now I need you to do the honors.
19849	Molly	Have her come in for a few sessions, I'll gladly prescribe antidepressants.
19850	Dr. Kelso	That's going to be a problem.
19851	Molly	Why?
19852	Dr. Kelso	She doesn't know she's taking them.
19853	J.D.'s Narration	The key to sleeping in the on-call room is to block out the noises around you like snoring, teeth-grinding, or even....
19854	J.D.'s Thoughts	...on-call room nookie. Hello, my old friend, how I've missed you.Yes, it does.Time out, male moaning! Party's over!
19855	J.D.	Hey!Woooogh!
19856	Dan	Hey, little brother.
19857	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19858	Turk	You know, on 'The Sopranos,' if a guy caught his brother with his ex-girlfriend, he'd just rub his ass out!
19859	J.D.	Oh, believe you me, the second I get Dan alone, there's gonna be some serious ass-rubbing. I shouldn't smack-talk.
19860	Dan	Hey, mind if I join you guys?
19861	Dr. Cox	I think the question you should be asking is, "Mind if I diddle your ex?"
19862	Dan	Thanks, Coxy!
19863	J.D.'s Narration	I knew it was my turn to let Dan have it, but for some reason I wasn't mad.
19864	J.D.	Listen, Dan
19865	Dan	J.D., let me explain. I came to the hospital to see you, and then I ran into Elliot and it just happened. It was a one-time thing.
19866	J.D.	I'm okay with it.
19867	Dan	Great, 'cause it's been going on for a few weeks. Elliot's amazing! Smart, funny...hhhot. I was in a dark place and she saved me, she really did. Haven't felt this good since my dad died.
19868	J.D.	Our dad.
19869	Dan	Right.
19870	Turk	Hold up! When Carla and I came home yesterday, we heard something. Did you two hook up in J.D.'s room?
19871	Dan	A friend wouldn't ask and a gentleman wouldn't tell.
19872	Turk	Did you?
19873	Dan	Twice! But we didn't go under the sheets out of respect.
19874	J.D.	How thoughtful!
19875	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19876	Dr. Kelso	I'm so sorry you lost your grandmother. Our prayers go out to you and your family.
19877	Woman	Thank you, Doctor. That's very kind.
19878	Dr. Kelso	That'll be seventeen hundred dollars.
19879	Carla	Sir. Sir? It is not your job to collect money from patients!
19880	Dr. Kelso	I know, but I just fired the woman who usually does it.
19881	Carla	You fired Glenda? Why?
19882	Glenda	Oh, how precious! Mind if I hold him?
19883	Father	Go right ahead.
19884	Glenda	Oh. Aww.I FINALLY GOT A BABY!
19885	Dr. Kelso	She was stealing from the hospital.Oh, Dr. Clock. Uh, look, I'm afraid I wasn't being honest with you before. In my job, it seems like I'm always the bad guy. Hard as this is to admit, it gets to me sometimes. The point is, the antidepressants I asked you to prescribe weren't for my wife, they were for me.
19886	Molly	Oh, I understand. So what dosage are you on?
19887	Enid	Where are my Fig Newtons, Bob?!
19888	Dr. Kelso	I'm getting them, dear!About half a Newton?
19889	Molly	No dice.Hey!
19890	Dr. Cox	Boy, oh boy, does it look like you pissed off the wrong guy there, crunchy. And trust me, he'll make you pay.
19891	Molly	Oh, Dr. Kelso's all bluster. Underneath it all, I bet he's a sweetheart.
19892	Dr. Cox	No, no. Underneath it all, he is pure evil.
19893	Molly	Perry, no one's pure evil! I mean, yeah, some people have a hard outer shell, but inside, everybody has a creamy center.
19894	Dr. Cox	There are plenty of people here on this particular planet who are hard on the outside and hard on the inside.
19895	Molly	So they'd have more of a nougaty center?
19896	Dr. Cox	Lady, people aren't chocolates. D'you know what they are mostly? Bastards. Bastard-coated bastards with bastard filling. But I don't find them half as annoying as I find naive bobble-headed optimists who walk around vomiting sunshine.
19897	Molly	I'm touching your creamy center!
19898	Dr. Cox	Ohh, I am...so very angry...that I'm going to find someone to kill...just to prove her wrong. Uhhh.
19899	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19900	Turk	Why you acting like that whole Dan and Elliot thing doesn't bother you?
19901	J.D.	Because it doesn't.
19902	Turk	Dude, you're missing a great opportunity here, man. If you act like it bothers you, Elliot'll feel guilty and she'll finally forgive you for dumping her. I'm telling you, you gotta use this like I use my diabetes. Watch.Honey? My blood sugar's dipping.
19903	Carla	Don't move!
19904	Turk	Thanks, sweetness!
19905	J.D.	Oh my God! This could be my diabetes!
19906	Turk	Exactly. But you gotta use it before that window closes. Lucky for me, my diabetes window stays open 24/7.
19907	J.D.	Unless, God forbid, they find a cure.
19908	Turk	Amen, brother.
19909	Dr. Kelso	Bye, folks. You'll notice I knocked a hundred dollars off the bill because of the, uh, you know, baby-stealing thing.
19910	J.D.'s Narration	Turk was right. Lying to Elliot was the perfect way to get our friendship back to normal.
19911	Dan	Thanks for the loaner scooter, Johnny!
19912	J.D.	I wanna talk to you for a second! Can you turn that thing off?
19913	Dan	Sorry!
19914	Hell's Angel	Sorry!
19915	Tree-Climber	Sorry!
19916	J.D.	Look, when I caught you two yesterday, I didn't know what to say. But now I do. You really hurt me.
19917	Dan	Okie-dokie.
19918	J.D.	GUYS! THERE ARE SICK PEOPLE TRYING TO SLEEP!
19919	Elliot	J.D., are you really this upset?
19920	J.D.	Well how would you feel if I hooked up with one of your siblings?
19921	Elliot	A little confused considering I have four brothers. But not surprised. At you or Barry.
19922	J.D.	Barry?
19923	Elliot	I guess I just didn't think I was doing anything wrong.
19924	J.D.	Well obviously you did, or you woulda told me about it from the beginning.
19925	J.D.'s Thoughts	That one had to sting. I really wanna look back and see if it landed, but I'll have to go back to sad face first.Oh, it landed!
19926	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19927	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Clock, may I have a word?
19928	Dr. Cox	Uh-oh, it's payback time.
19929	Dr. Kelso	I got you a present for your trip to Mexico. It's my old Spanish-to-English dictionary. I don't need it anymore I've mastered the language.
19930	Molly	Gracias, Señor.
19931	Dr. Kelso	You're welcome-o!
19932	Molly	You were right payback's a bitch.
19933	Dr. Kelso	Well, just get back to me when you have an answer.
19934	Carla	Baby, check this out.
19935	Turk	Mm?
19936	Carla	Dr. Kelso just offered me Glenda's old job as administrative supervisor.
19937	Turk	Oh, that's great, sweetie.
19938	Carla	The job pays an extra seven thousand dollars a year!
19939	Turk	My baby's an administrative supervisor!Let's celebrate! Whatever you want!
19940	Carla	Ohh! Let's go shopping for a new duvet cover!
19941	Turk	Oh, I'd love to! But my diabetes is acting up.
19942	Dr. Cox	Bob. We have a problem.
19943	Dr. Kelso	Not now, Perry, I'm swamped. I'm trying to find an exterminator to kill the bat in my attic.
19944	Dr. Cox	Be a man, Bob! That's what tennis racquets are for!
19945	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19946	Dr. Kelso	Oh, good lord! He got Baxter!Try telling that to my one-eared dog.
19947	Dr. Cox	Bob, do you realize what you did by giving Blondie that book?
19948	Dr. Kelso	With any luck, I kept her from reporting me to the board for trying to con her out of meds.
19949	Dr. Cox	Thanks to your little gesture, she actually believes that the earth is full of people who, deep down, are filled with kindness and caring!
19950	Dr. Kelso	Well that's absurd. People are bastard-coated bastards with bastard filling.
19951	Dr. Cox	Exactly!
19952	Dr. Kelso	Oh, sweet Moses. Everything has gone straight down the crapper since Enid got off the antidepressants.
19953	Dr. Cox	I didn't know Enid suffered from depression.
19954	Dr. Kelso	She doesn't. Those pills kill her sex drive.
19955	Dr. Cox	Oh!
19956	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19957	J.D.	Dude, your idea totally worked!
19958	Turk	Incoming, man.
19959	J.D.	MY OWN BROTHER! WHY!?
19960	Turk	You can stop now, she's gone.
19961	J.D.	No, I think I broke my hand.
19962	J.D.'s Narration	There's nothing more satisfying than having a good plan.
19963	Molly	Goodnight, amigos.
19964	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes a plan can crystallize in a moment.
19965	Dr. Kelso	What are we gonna do?
19966	Dr. Cox	Let's destroy her.
19967	J.D.'s Narration	And sometimes a plan can fall apart just as quickly.
19968	Turk	Ehhh? So when do you start your new job?
19969	Carla	I turned it down.
19970	Turk	What?
19971	Carla	I know it's a dream job, but with your diabetes I think you need me more.
19972	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, in my plan nobody gets hurt.
19973	Dan	Hey, little brother.
19974	J.D.	AAAAGGGHHH! What are you doing back in the tub!?
19975	Dan	Elliot dumped me.

19978	Dan	She's gone! She's gone! Ohh, why? Ohh, why. Better llllearn how to f-face it. She's gone, she's gone! Ohhhhoh, why! Ohhh, why! What went wrooooong!
19979	J.D.	Don't you think you're overreacting?
19980	Dan	No, J.D., I don't, because Elliot was the best thing that ever happened to me and now she's gone. Ahhhh...she's gone! She's gone. She's...gone! She's gone...she's gone.
19981	J.D.	That's not even the right gibberish!
19982	Dan	You know what, J.D.? Elliot and I were supposed to have a big romantic evening together, and look at all this stuff I bought. Candles. Champagne. A Dido CD. I guess I'll just throw these things out with rest of the garbage.
19983	J.D.	Oh, come on, don't go. We can watch 'Kangaroo Jack' and chug a Foster's every time they say "g'day"!
19984	Dan	G'day, J.D.
19985	J.D.	Dan!
19986	Dan	I said g'day!

19988	Turk	Baby, you have to take this job.
19989	Carla	Let it go. It's done!
19990	J.D.	You okay?
19991	Turk	No. Sometimes I wish I'd never gotten this stupid diabetes!
19992	J.D.	Hey! Let's not get crazy!
19993	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19994	Dr. Cox	Dear God, she has an actual skip in her step.
19995	Dr. Kelso	Doesn't bother me as much as the whistling. Watch what happens.Why are you whistling, Ted? Your life is pathetic.
19996	Ted	Right.
19997	Dr. Kelso	Perry, what's our plan of attack?
19998	Dr. Cox	When I crush a person's spirit, I like to use a combination of intimidation and degradation.
19999	Dr. Kelso	I prefer to create an environment in which the subjects end up crushing themselves!
20000	Dr. Cox	Aha.
20001	Janitor	I like to pick one person and torment them relentlessly for no reason. If I could find them I'd show ya.He's near.
20002	Dr. Cox	I'm not sure moon-beam is going to break so easily. I just wish we knew something personal that would really get to her.
20003	Dr. Kelso	Turns out you can't go to your mom's wedding. There's too much shift-switching going on here and I don't like shift-switching. It's too hard to say!
20004	Dr. Cox	Awww. That wasn't very soft and creamy.
20005	Molly	It's okay. He has a hospital to run, I understand.
20006	Dr. Cox	Good God. She can't be stopped.
20007	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
20008	Dr. Kelso	Let me get this straight: You want me to offer your wife the same job she's already turned down. Is that about the size of it, Turkleton?
20009	Turk	Actually, sir, my last name isn't Turkleton, it's just Turk. As in Chris Turk.
20010	Dr. Kelso	I prefer Turkleton.
20011	Turk	Sir, I promise you, if you offer her the job again she'll say yes. And I'll do anything I'll pick up extra shifts, I'll volunteer I'll volunteer at the clinic whatever you want!
20012	Dr. Kelso	Ahh! I want you to kill the giant bat that's been living in my attic!
20013	Turk	You keep Enid in the attic?
20014	Dr. Kelso	You make me laugh, Turkleton. 8 o'clock, sharp. And wear goggles.
20015	Turk	Yes!
20016	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
20017	J.D.'s Narration	I decided the only way Elliot would take Dan back is if she knew the truth that their being together didn't really bother me.
20018	J.D.	Elliot, we need to talk. Nice jammies!
20019	Elliot	Thanks, they're new!
20020	J.D.	This'll only take a second.Look, you know how I told you I was upset about you and Dan? Is that champagne?
20021	Elliot	Yeah. Yeah, I was celebrating my...new jammies.
20022	J.D.	I love champagne. You mind if I have a little? Thank you. A nipper!Ahh! Tingly! It's a tingly drink! Oooooh! Pretty candles! Anyhoo, I know you broke up with Dan because you thought I was upset, but in reality, I...uh...I... "I want to thank you! For giving me the best day of my life..." I love this song, who is it?
20023	Elliot	Dido. And you've really got to meet my brother Barry.
20024	J.D.	Dido?
20025	Dan	Look at all this stuff I bought. Candles. Champagne. A Dido CD.
20026	J.D.	Dan?
20027	Dan	Hey, little brother!
20028	J.D.	AAGGHH!
20029	Dan	Agh!Tingles.

20031	Turk	Carla, we have to talk.
20032	Carla	Is it your blood sugar again? I'll get you something!
20033	Turk	Baby, I feel fine. It's just that I kinda been using my diabetes to get you to, you know, hook me up with sandwiches and whatnot.
20034	Carla	I can't believe you!
20035	Ted	Oh, man! I brought that from home!
20036	Turk	Look, baby, before you get freaked out, I fixed it already. Look!
20037	Dr. Kelso	Nurse Turkleton! I wanted to offer you that job once more!
20038	Carla	I don't want it!
20039	Dr. Kelso	Great! See you Saturday, bat-man.
20040	Turk	Baby, what the hell!
20041	Carla	Umm.... Maybe I decided right away that I didn't want that job because I'd miss working with patients but I didn't tell you because you were excited about the money, so I used your diabetes as an excuse. I don't know...I don't really remember.....
20042	Ted	Tastes funny.
20043	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
20044	Dr. Cox	You see, Bob, it didn't even faze her.
20045	Dr. Kelso	Patience, Perry. With a tough one like her, you have to wait for it.Here it comes.And we've broken her! There sits a dejected a woman, all alone, wounded, vulnerable....
20046	Dr. Cox	Crying.
20047	Dr. Kelso	She's ruining it for me.
20048	Dr. Cox	Lady, stop cryin'!
20049	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Clock, you don't have to miss your wedding. I was lying about shift-switching. I like doing it, I like saying it shift-switching. And I only lied because we were trying to destroy your morale.
20050	Molly	Why would you do that?
20051	Dr. Cox	Well, in our defense, you're overly cheery and we were bored.
20052	Molly	But you thought it would be nice to come clean and make me feel better?
20053	Dr. Kelso	Pretty much.
20054	Dr. Cox	Pretty much, yeah.
20055	Molly	See, I told you there's good in everyone. If you'll excuse me, boys, I've got a plane to catch.
20056	Dr. Cox	Don't even pretend like you knew what we were doing all along.
20057	Molly	Adios, boys.
20058	Dr. Cox	Was she always wearing that big hat?
20059	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
20060	J.D.	I can't believe you two never broke up. Dan was in my tub for four hours, drinking beers and singing "She's Gone."
20061	Dan	How do you take a bath?Okay, I'm gonna get dressed. Hey, Elliot, do you mind if I borrow one of your socks? I seem to have lost my righty in the fray! Oh! There you are, high-flyer! Hm!
20062	Elliot	J.D., Dan and I both know this is just a fling. Still, I feel like the worst person in the whole world. Please, can you forgive me?
20063	J.D.	Elliot, I came here to tell you I was never actually mad at you.
20064	Elliot	How could you not be mad that I was hooking up with your brother?
20065	J.D.	I don't know. I just...wasn't.
20066	Elliot	I don't know I I just didn't.
20067	J.D.'s Narration	That's when I realized that Elliot and I had absolutely no romantic feeling for each other anymore.No matter what the situation.It was a little sad, but, who knows? Maybe it meant we could be friends again.
20068	Dan	Hey! I can't find my Dido CD!
20069	J.D.	If my heart could write songs, they'd sound like these.
20070	J.D.'s Narration	I think relationships are inherently fragile. They can be strengthened by a shared excuse.
20071	Carla	Turk! We just got invited to Linda's Jack & Jill bridal shower. Do you mind if I use your diabetes to get out of it?
20072	Turk	Of course not, baby!And now....it's bat-killing time!Wahow! Good lord!
20073	J.D.'s Narration	Others can be torn apart by the loss of a common enemy.
20074	Dr. Cox	I hate you, Bob.
20075	Dr. Kelso	Same times a thousand, big guy.
20076	Dan	Well, goodnight, little bro.
20077	J.D.	Oh, goodnight, Dan. Sleep tight. There's a bus schedule underneath your pillow.
20078	J.D.'s Narration	And for Elliot and I...turns out all we needed was a little time.
20079	Elliot	'Night, J.D.
20080	J.D.	What was that for?
20081	J.D.'s Narration	The good news was this Elliot and Dan thing meant that I was back on the market!
20082	J.D.	Can I buy you a drink?
20083	Girl	No thanks.
20084	J.D.'s Narration	Yep! I'm back, baby!
20085	J.D.	More nuts, please.
20086	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
20087	Patient	Doctor's comin'!
20088	J.D.	What the...?
20089	Patient	Frank, you idiot. Your bed's down the hall!
20090	Frank	I know! I love you....
20091	Elliot	Ohh!
20092	J.D.	You ever get the feeling our patients pretend to be sicker when we're around?
20093	Elliot	Oh, yeah. You know Mrs. Wilson back there? She made her spleen pretend to rupture, and then she pretended to die.Got me again, there, Mrs. Wilson!
20094	J.D.	You know, Elliot, since I broke your heart, I've held my tongue every time you've been a wiseacre. But now that you slept with my brother, we're even. So if you bring sarcasm my way, baby, prepare to be stung!
20095	Elliot	J.D.
20096	J.D.	So's your face.
20097	Elliot	That doesn't even make any sense.
20098	J.D.	"So's your face" always makes sense.
20099	Carla	J.D., that's stupid.
20100	J.D.	So's your face! I'm on fire! Helloooo!
20101	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
20102	Dr. Kelso	Perry, are you familiar with Sacred Heart's community service program?
20103	Dr. Cox	Bobby, lately I've noticed you don't listen to a single word people say, so my reply to your question is I think you're the world's biggest jackass and I look forward to your death.
20104	Dr. Kelso	Well, you must not be familiar with it because you're the only staff member not to have completed his 24-hour mandatory community service. Consider yourself suspended until you do! Oh, and I'm never dying.
20105	Dr. Cox	Oh, guh!
20106	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
20107	Molly	Crab claw.
20108	Elliot	Ow!
20109	Molly	Yeah, does it make you mad?
20110	Elliot	I don't know, it was kind of a
20111	Molly	Crab claw!
20112	Elliot	Ow! What are you doing!?
20113	Molly	I'm moving to Milwaukee for a psychiatric fellowship, and by pinching your arm I'm making you angry instead of feeling overwhelmed with sadness that I'm leaving.
20114	Elliot	You're leaving?
20115	Molly	Don't cry, you're gonna make me cry.
20116	Guy	They're here! Ignite the tractor beam!
20117	Molly	I should go, that's my 2 o'clock.
20118	Elliot	Oh....
20119	Turk	Hospital just lost its second-hottest employee.
20120	Carla	Don't think you can drool all over her just because you rank me number one.
20121	Turk	Baby, Nurse Tisdale's number one.You g you gotta be single to be on the list.
20122	Elliot	You actually rank the women of this hospital by their appearance?
20123	J.D.	Calm down, Twelve.
20124	Elliot	Yes, top twenty!
20125	J.D.	I don't know, Elliot. Molly and I really aren't that close.
20126	J.D.'s Narration	Okay, a lot happened between that moment and this one. I should explain.Elliot did end up throwing Molly a goodbye party.
20127	Molly	This is amazing, Elliot, thank you.
20128	Elliot	I also had a piñata made to look exactly like you, but I don't know what happened to it.
20129	Todd	Whoa, it's gettin' late. Big Dog wants some candy.
20130	Turk	Yes, baby, Molly is attractive. But she doesn't hold a candle to my Puerto Rican princess!
20131	Carla	For the last time, Turk: I'm Dominican.
20132	Girl	My nephew Ryan is so cute. He's six.
20133	J.D.'s Narration	I was content to lay low and flirt in the corner. See, the most important thing about hospital get-togethers is to make sure you don't do anything people will be talking about the next day.
20134	Doug	Wow, look, flaming shots!
20135	Girl	...goes through like the whole day that he's grown up! Oh my God, I love it.
20136	J.D.	Will you excuse me a moment?AAAAGGGGHHHHH! PUT ME OUT! PUT ME OUT!
20137	Doug	All right! Stand back, everyone! I'll handle this!
20138	J.D.	OW! DOUG! WHY!? AAAGGGHHH!AAAGGGHHH! The sinks are broken! The sinks are broken! Hot! Hot! Hot, hot, hot, hot!So your nephew is six, huh? That's a crazy age!
20139	J.D.'s Narration	After the fire marshal closed down the bar, we took the party back to our place.
20140	Todd	Sorry I'm late. Player had a date. Anybody want some chocolate?
20141	J.D.'s Narration	Eventually things wound down. Some people went home....Some just went to bed....
20142	Carla	'Night.
20143	J.D.'s Narration	And that's how Molly and I ended up alone on the couch, watching that unbelievably romantic scene from '16 Candles'.No, not that one! This one.
20144	'16 Candles Jake	Happy birthday, Samantha.
20145	J.D.'s Narration	God bless Molly Ringwald. And this Molly. Ah, the hell with it! God bless Mollys everywhere!

20147	Turk	Dude, now that I have adjusted your fuel valve, your scooter is going to fly!
20148	J.D.	Speaking of things that are fly, I made out with Molly last night. I know that was kind of a lame segue, but I've been with you all morning and you've yet to use the words "make" or "out."
20149	Molly	I hope it doesn't bother you.
20150	Elliot	Nah. How was it?
20151	Molly	Weird. His tongue was freezing.
20152	J.D.	I gave her the ol' ice tongue. It's easy to do, you just have to be really smooth.
20153	Molly	He kept running to the kitchen to put ice on his tongue.
20154	Elliot	Ugh, I always hated ice tongue. And sometimes his lips seemed so greasy.
20155	J.D.	I'm telling you, Turk. Olive oil.
20156	Turk	Dude, just because it's good on salad doesn't mean it's good on your lips.

20158	Carla	I wuv your wittle outfit.
20159	Dr. Cox	Now listen, you: Riding in an ambulance takes care of my community service, so I'm doing two shifts back to back I'm gonna knock this whole thing out in a single day. Besides, how bad can it be?
20160	Denise	Howdy, partner! Name's Denise Lemon. Looks like we got ourselves a little ambu-date that's "ambulance" and "date" put together. I got a million of those!
20161	Carla	I am loving this!
20162	Denise	Hey, uh, hon, before you hop in there, could you do me a little favoroony and check the windshield wiper? I think I got something caught up there. Yeah.
20163	Dr. Cox	No problem. I got it.
20164	Denise	I always get the newbies with that one! Got you! You know it!
20165	Dr. Cox	When they strap me in the chair, please let them know the murder was just.
20166	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
20167	J.D.	Hey, Elliot, I was making out some prescription orders and speaking of making out
20168	Elliot	She already told me, J.D.
20169	J.D.	Oh, damn, I was afraid that was gonna get out. Does anybody else know that I totally made out with Molly? Up here!
20170	Elliot	Now that you made out with my best friend, that makes us not even again. So go get me some cotton balls and a toe separator mama needs a pedicure! Heh.
20171	J.D.	Elliot, once you're even, you can't just go back to being not even. That ain't new, girl!
20172	Elliot	Admit we're not even or I'll make you pay.
20173	J.D.	Heh, yeah, now that we're friends and there's no chance of us ever having sex again, there's really not a whole lot I "need" from you, okay? So g'head and give it your best shot.
20174	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
20175	Denise	Doctor, doctor, gimme the news I got a
20176	Dr. Cox	Yeah, I'm not a big car-singing kind of guy.
20177	Denise	Aww, "Bad case of loving you," Perr! Come on, where's the fun?
20178	Dr. Cox	You're saying you don't.
20179	Denise	Well, Perr, sometimes you do.
20180	Dr. Cox	Can't take my eyes off of him.
20181	Denise	I don't blame you, he's gorgeous! He looks just like his mama! I'm kidding!
20182	Dr. Cox	I like "strangle."
20183	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
20184	J.D.	There she is! Thanks, Juan!
20185	Molly	J.D., I have to tell you something.
20186	J.D.	Oh, no, did someone you know die from beer?
20187	Molly	No one can die from beer.
20188	Shinski	Hey, yo, J.D., toss me a beer, man.
20189	J.D.	Comin' at you, Shinski!People can die from beer, Molly. Shinski didn't, but our friendship did.
20190	Molly	J.D., you just don't have that edgy mean streak that I'm attracted to.
20191	J.D.	You were saying?
20192	Turk	Dude, what the hell!?Oh, that's what's up. Go about your business!
20193	Molly	Look, I'm sorry, but I'm attracted to damaged, dysfunctional people, and you're just too normal.
20194	J.D.'s Thoughts	Sometimes all it takes is a slammin' hottie to make you dig down deep and discover who you really are.
20195	J.D.	My emotional journey began at five years old when I walked in on my parents having sex in a position my father would later playfully describe as "the jackhammer." I have a mentor that verbally abuses me every chance he gets, and no matter how much I try, I can't stop constantly narrating my own life.
20196	J.D.'s Narration	At that very moment, I feared I had divulged too much.
20197	J.D.	Molly, I'm narcissistic, I'm pessimistic, I'm obsessive, I'm insecure. And I am so afraid of intimacy that every one of my relationships is a journey of self-sabotage that inevitably ends in a black vacuum of shattered expectations and despair.
20198	Molly	Wow.
20199	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
20200	Dr. Cox	Boy, I tell you what, there, Jordan, I'm sure glad that shift is
20201	Denise	Perry! I was just telling Jordan here about that sneezing attack that I had this morning. Was it fourteen or fifteen sneezes?
20202	Jordan	Yes, Perry, was it fourteen or fifteen sneezes?
20203	Dr. Cox	What are you doing here, Denise?
20204	Denise	Well, I heard that you were doing back to back shifts, so I pulled a couple of strings so that we could get the old band back together!
20205	Jordan	Perry! You've always wanted to be in a band!
20206	Denise	Get out of town! I just came up with that band thing!
20207	Jordan	Get out of town, Perry!
20208	Dr. Cox	Heh!
20209	Denise	Well, laissez le bon temps roulez. Translation: Let the good times roll. See, that's what they say in New Orleans, The Big Easy. You know, that was my nickname in high school New Orleans. No, I'm just kidding, it was The Big Easy. I was a huge slut! I was, I did everybody.
20210	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
20211	Molly	Much better without the icy tongue.
20212	J.D.	I'll remember that.
20213	J.D.'s Thoughts	Why would she lie?
20214	J.D.	Should we get out of here?
20215	Molly	D'you think you can handle it?
20216	J.D.	No. But you won't know until after.
20217	Molly	You just need to clear it with one person first.
20218	J.D.	Just tell me who!
20219	Elliot	No.
20220	J.D.	That doesn't even make any sense!
20221	Elliot	So's your face!
20222	J.D.'s Thoughts	Dammit! Walked into that one!
20223	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
20224	J.D.'s Thoughts	The key here is to not seem desperate.
20225	J.D.	Please, Elliot! Please let me have sex! She's leaving tomorrow!
20226	Elliot	It's simple, J.D.: I'll give you the OK if you just admit we're not even.
20227	J.D.	I am sorry, but that is one thing that will never happen.Fine, we're not even.
20228	Elliot	Thank you.
20229	J.D.	But Molly just left, so you have to call her at home!
20230	Elliot	I'm not gonna do that. But, I will write you a note.

20233	Denise	So, little Jack's a baseball fan, eh?
20234	Jordan	He's two and he can't talk yet.
20235	Denise	You know what you should do? You should get him some baseball cards! I got my son, Davey, a Ken Griffey Jr. card? Carries it with him wherever he goes. Never liked the gum, though. Gum's a weird word, isn't it? You know? Do you ever notice some words, you say 'em enough, they don't even sound like words anymore? Gum.... Gum. Gum. Gum! Gum, gum, gum, gum, gum, gum, gum, gum, gum, gum, gum, gum, gum, gum, gummmm. Gum gum gum...
20236	Dr. Cox	Oh, happy day. She's blown a fuse. Mm. I swear to God, Jordan, I can't do it again.
20237	Jordan	Perry, it's just one more shift. Just tune her out and she'll eventually leave you alone.

20267	Carla	I don't understand what the big deal is. It's just sex.
20268	Turk	It's not just sex. It's sex with Molly! Any guy would kill to have sex with Molly. Hell, I'd kill to have sex with Molly!
20269	Carla	That's it.
20270	Turk	Sorry, dude. Where were you?
20271	J.D.	I was treed by that coyote!
20272	Turk	You got your phone?

20274	Turk	I can't run in these jeans, they're too constricting!Yeah, this is much better!
20275	J.D.	I agree, but my legs are cramping!
20276	Turk	You spent too much time crouching in that tree, didn't you!
20277	J.D.	I was kneeling on a nest!
20278	Turk	Just think of Molly, man!
20279	Molly	J.D., where are you? J.D.! Hurry!
20280	Turk	Now that's what I'm talkin' about!
20281	Denise	It's okay.Hey, Perr. I just saw an adorable interracial gay couple. Aw, just precious.
20282	Dr. Cox	Lookit, enough of the squawk-box, all right? And just keep your eye on the road, whatta you say?
20283	Denise	All right, no more squawk-box. But, Perr, don't sweat the roads. I know 'em like the back of my hand.Ohh, Perr...I think I'm hurt. Well, not badly hurt, just a tidbit. Ouch....

20285	J.D.	Elliot, you gotta help me! We're in front of Molly's apartment, but her name isn't listed anymore.
20286	Elliot	It's either...4G or 5G. J.D., this is ridiculous, it's 4 o'clock in the morning. Even if you catch her, she's leaving for the airport in like ten minutes.
20287	J.D.	That's perfect! That'll leave us five minutes to cuddle!Hi, is Molly here?
20288	Dr. Kelso	It's not my wife, is it, Debbie?
20289	J.D.	Sorry, wrong apartment.Konichiwa.

20300	Dr. Cox	Denise, that's not very likely. And here's why: All you do is talk, talk, talk talk, talk, talk, talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk. And when you're not talking, I'm betting you're thinking about talking. I mean, can I ask you a personal question? Have you ever had a thought that you didn't immediately verbalize?
20301	Denise	Well, I don't know. That's a tough one, Perr.
20302	Dr. Cox	Uh-huh.
20303	Denise	Oh, look, the window's open again! You can see the moon!
20304	Dr. Cox	Oh my God. What happened in your life that made you so needy that you've got to fill every waking second by babbling on?
20305	Denise	Fine, don't visit. My son will come.
20306	Dr. Cox	And now we are right back on your son again. I'll be honest with you, I'm worried that I'm not going to be able to get your voice out of my head. It is a very real concern.
20307	EMT	Hey, did you leave anything in the ambulance?
20308	Dr. Cox	Only my will to live, why?
20309	EMT	Then I guess this is your partner's.
20310	Dr. Cox	What happened to your son, Denise?
20311	Denise	He died in an accident.

20315	J.D.	Molly, I think you should stay. I'm off today, we'll have an amazing time, you can leave tomorrow.
20316	Molly	I'm not sure that's a good idea.
20317	J.D.	Well, maybe this'll change your mind.
20318	Turk	How's it going?
20319	J.D.	Pretty well. Nice landing.
20320	Turk	Thanks.
20321	Molly	J.D., I think this note's for you.
20322	J.D.'s Narration	I think the easiest way to lose something is to want it too badly.
20323	Molly	Take care.
20324	J.D.	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
20325	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, it doesn't help if your friend is a diabolical genius. Still, when you come across a person who's lost something that really matters, you have to answer the call.
20326	Denise	Ooh, he's just such a cutie pie! Look at that! Have you ever had cutie pie, Perry?
20327	Dr. Cox	No, 'course not.
20328	Denise	I like it à la mode.
20329	Dr. Cox	Okay.
20330	Denise	I'm kidding! I know it's not really pie! But I'll tell you, if it was really pie I would eat it up, I'd gobble it, because I love pie! Oh my God! You're my favorite!

20332	J.D.	I don't know why, but I feel like Turk and Carla are upset
20333	J.D	May I have a pancake please?
20334	J.D.	Okay, they're mad. I'm pretty sure it's because of my new girlfriend.You know, the funniest thing happened
20335	Neena	I'm eating.
20336	J.D.	Sorry. I'm starvin'. Wish I hadn't left my walletAlso, the sex could be a little impersonal.So that's a no on cuddling?Still, Turk and

20339	J.D.	Bye! FYI, there was no spanking last night, okay?
20340	Carla	Really? Then this won't hurt.
20341	J.D.	Nope.
20342	Turk	Hit him again baby.
20343	J.D.	Why?After spreading half a tube of what I thought was burn
20344	Elliot	What smells like Vagisil?
20345	J.D.	Nothing. How can I help you?
20346	Elliot	Remember how I thought Mr. Peterson's back pain was sacroiliitis and
20347	J.D.	Elliot, you should never use scalding hot coffee for a victory sip.
20348	Elliot	Oh yeah? Well you're ***so something something ***.
20349	J.D.	Over the past few months Eliot's come into her own as a
20350	Kelso	Attention staff: One of our hospital's board
20351	J.D.	Of course around here, everybody's looking to prove
20352	Kelso	Go.
20353	Elliot	So Craig, how's your grandmother doing?
20354	Craig	Oh, she's much better now, thanks. Turns out it was just
20355	Elliot	Thanks! Oh... Hmph.
20356	Carla	J.D., how could you do this to Turk? You two are so close that I
20357	J.D.	Where do we go?
20358	Turk	One time we went to Aspen.
20359	J.D.	Oh, I hope it was summer. I'm not that big a skier.
20360	Carla	Girls! I want an explanation.
20361	J.D.	Fine. Turk, tell her our code.
20362	Turk	If you haven't had sex in six
20363	Carla	Oh please, when you were single, you were never that desperate...
20364	Woman	Oh that was amazing.
20365	Turk	Yes, it was.We're all God's children in the dark.
20366	Carla	Christopher Duncan Turk, you tell him how you really feel, just like
20367	Turk	I want you to stop seeing her.
20368	J.D.	Fine. But I'm only ending it because friends come first.
20369	Carla	Plus, you already had sex with her.
20370	J.D.	Four a half times! Lata!
20371	Elliot	Jordan. You're on the board, what is the story on my patient Mr.
20372	Jordan	Well Stick, I'm going to warn you the same way I warn Perry every
20373	Elliot	That's disturbing in like... eight different ways.
20374	Cox	Barbie, the guy's a sexist pig. He's gonna eat you alive.
20375	Elliot	Look, I'm not the same doctor I was four years ago. I'm smarter, I'm
20376	Cox	Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Just skip the rest of your "I'll show you speech"
20377	Neena	So should we start this deposition, or do you boys just want to hand
20378	Mr. Corman	Big bag of money...
20379	Turk	You aren't going to freeze up around her again, are you Ted?
20380	Ted	No chance. I'm drugged up. Plus, if I concentrate, I
20381	Neena	Ted, you ready to get started?
20382	Ted	Whenever you're ready, Neena. First
20383	Turk	We should take a short recess.
20384	Neena	Believe me, you're better off.
20385	Kelso	I agree.
20386	Neena	Now, Mr. Corman is contending that the shoulder surgery he received
20387	Kelso	You're diabetic?
20388	Turk	Yes. I told you that.
20389	Kelso	I thought you were joking.
20390	Turk	How is that funny?
20391	Kelso	Well, it's a very serious disease. And I don't like you.
20392	Turk	How do we even know he plays tennis? Look at him.
20393	Mr. Corman	Wait for the serve.
20394	Kelso	We're settling.
20395	Mr. Corman	Hey, I want you
20396	J.D.	Hey Neena. God help
20397	Neena	No.
20398	J.D.	You can't just say no. No is the answer to a question. And I clearly
20399	Elliot	So how are we feeling Mr. Summers?
20400	Mr. Summers	I feel like my ex-wife is standing on my chest. And not the
20401	Elliot	Fantastic! I'd like to start by
20402	Mr. Summers	Listen, Goldilocks. Unless the next three words out of your
20403	Elliot	Actually sir
20404	Mr. Summers	His name is Elliot Reid. So, what's the word? This guy any
20405	Elliot	Oh, he rocks!
20406	Turk	Baby, you know if my malpractice insurance goes through the roof,
20407	Carla	I live in a tiny apartment with my husband, his best friend, and
20408	Turk	Yeah, I am pretty impressive.
20409	Carla	Yes you are. Now don't you let anything else get into that beautiful
20410	Turk	What could get into this man's head, baby? Huh?
20411	Cox	Tough day, huh? You wanna talk about it?
20412	J.D.	Neena, it's over.
20413	Neena	No it's not. In fact, I find myself oddly turned on by your timid
20414	J.D.	First of all, thank you. Secondly, I tried to be reasonable. Now if
20415	Neena	Yet another strong moment for you?
20416	J.D.	Okay, fine, why don't you just tell me how this ends?
20417	Neena	You won't break up with me, you will betray your friend.
20418	J.D.	What is this, some kind of lawyer mind trick? It's not gonna happen!
20419	Neena	Sit down.
20420	J.D.	I won't, I'm leaving.
20421	Neena	You're going to have sex with me.
20422	J.D.	I'll do nothing of the sort.
20423	Neena	And as the ultimate act of betrayal, you will do it on the very same
20424	J.D.	Oh, I hate a dirty table.
20425	Neena	You love a dirty table.
20426	J.D.	God help me, I do. I do love a dirty table.
20427	Elliot	Okay, Mr. Summers. Your EKGs came back and Dr. Reid liked what he
20428	Mr. Summers	When the hell am I getting out of here?
20429	Elliot	Dr. Reid thought you might ask that and he had an answer for you.
20430	Mr. Summers	Wow, he's old school. Like me.
20431	Elliot	Hey! That belongs to Dr. Reid!
20432	Mr. Summers	So you and Reid...
20433	Elliot	Yes. We're lovers. Red hot lovers.
20434	Mr. Summers	I'm guessing he's married.
20435	Elliot	She doesn't understand him like I do.
20436	Mr. Summers	I love this guy.
20437	Elliot	Not like I do.
20438	Carla	Hey, Turk's kind of in a dark place right now, so stay away from him,
20439	Cox	Of course. But, uh, we kind of crossed paths already.Life is pointless Gandhi, and I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.
20440	Carla	And you reminded him that people are basically good.
20441	Cox	People suck. They suck. And make no mistake about it, even sweet littleWe covered people.
20442	Carla	And I know you would never do anything to ruin his innocence.
20443	Cox	You see, there's a compartment in the hat. So the stinkin' rabbit is

20445	Cox	People pretty much hear what they want to hear, okay?

20448	Turk	I'd love to! I would love to! Do you have a dog, Bowl Cut? Well, I
20449	Carla	You are so dead.
20450	J.D.	You can only keep the truth hidden for so long.
20451	Mr. Summers	Enough is enough. I want to meet this Dr. Reid!
20452	Elliot	No problem! Frick!
20453	Carla	Turk, wait! Let's sit down and talk about this.
20454	J.D.	And when the truth comes out, it doesn't set you free as

20457	J.D.	Wait, hold on Turk! Haven't you ever heard of keeping your enemies

20459	J.D.	Sure, Dr. Cox and I were feeling guilty. But if Turk
20460	Carla	May I have a word with you two?
20461	Elliot	Okay, who wants to be me? Craig, you're probably still mad at me.
20462	Todd	Dr. Reid. At your service.
20463	Elliot	Okay, that's a no for Todd. Isn't there anyone here that I can trust
20464	Janitor	Hello. I'm Dr. Reid. Dr. Elliot Reid. I'm a doctor.
20465	Carla	What is the matter with you two? J.D., you said you were going to
20466	J.D.	I know! Believe me, the whole time we were having sex I was thinking
20467	Carla	And you! Why do you want everybody in this hospital to be as
20468	Cox	How could you not get this? What does misery love?
20469	Carla	Alright, look
20470	J.D.	Company! Misery loves company! Misery loves company...
20471	Carla	Oh God...
20472	Cox	Okay, sure sure. Maybe we did screw up, just a pequito, but come on.
20473	Carla	Oh yeah, then who?
20474	Mr. Corman	Hiya fellas!
20475	Janitor	Summers, I think we can save your foot.
20476	Elliot	It's his heart.
20477	Janitor	I know that. We're concerned about your ticker.
20478	Elliot	Ahem!
20479	Janitor	Ah, yes. Yes yes. Well, your paper script looks good. But, I'm
20480	J.D.	My talk with Carla gave me the courage to take a stand.
20481	Neena	If you talk about ending our relationship again, I'll punish you.
20482	J.D.	Punish me? How?You know what, no, this is crazy. I am not going to get your nameAnd that's when I realized I would never be strong enough
20483	Jordan	Someone must have left this here from Halloween.
20484	Elliot	God, Dr. Cox is going to go off on me. It's going to be worse than
20485	Jordan	Don't you mean Playboy?
20486	Elliot	No.
20487	Jordan	So you're saying that your brother's
20488	Elliot	Yes.
20489	Jordan	Has he actually told your family that
20490	Elliot	No.
20491	Jordan	But everyone's positive that he's
20492	Elliot	Yes.
20493	Jordan	Do you think he and another guy have ever
20494	Elliot	No more questions.
20495	Jordan	Elliot, if you can handle that sexist dirtbag in there, you can
20496	Elliot	Why are you being nice to me?
20497	Jordan	Okay, Perry occasionally talks to me at home. And he told me that
20498	Elliot	Really?
20499	J.D.	Jordan? I need you to break up with somebody for me.
20500	Jordan	Really.

20511	Jordan	I'll be fine.
20512	J.D.	I was talking to myself.
20513	Neena	Oh, there you are. Go get in the backseat of my car and lie down on

20517	Neena	You got something to say? Say it.
20518	J.D.	The thing about strong women... If you call them out,
20519	Cox	I should have known, Barbie. Hell, you have been impersonating a doctor
20520	Elliot	Look, I did what I had to do to treat this guy. And as far as me
20521	Mr. Summers	What?!
20522	Elliot	Oh, and by the way. I had a little chat with your wife. I know I'm

20536	Turk	What?
20537	Mr. Corman	Ever since the surgery I've been serving lefty. It's a little

20541	Turk	It's okay, man. She's a woman. I understand.
20542	J.D.	And the truth was, he did understand. No matter how much
20543	Little Cox	Jordan looks mad, I should go.

20553	Carla	You're doctors. Doctors.
20554	Turk	Baby?
20555	J.D.	Go get her, Turk!
20556	Turk	Waaaaaaiiiiit!
20557	J.D.	Oh, he's slow.
20558	J.D.'s Thoughts	Time to go see my favorite patient, Mr. Gregory Marks. He may need a new kidney, but he sure as hell doesn't need a new heart.
20559	Mr. Marks	Hey, I bought you a present.
20560	J.D.	Oh, my God, a journal!
20561	Mr. Marks	Well, you seem like the kind of sensitive young buck that likes to chronicle his feelings.
20562	J.D.'s Thoughts	I can't wait to chronicle this one! Oh God!
20563	J.D.	I gotta tell you, Mr. Marks even though I know you'd never take it, I'd give you one of my kidneys in a second.
20564	Mr. Marks	Oh, no, I would definitely take it! I would take it with my bare hands.
20565	J.D.	Awesome. Well...let me check your chart and s-see if we're a match!

20569	Cafeteria Worker	Nope.
20570	Elliot	Oh. Isn't that just the pickle on the giant crap sandwich that is my day!
20571	Turk	Elliot, relax; I never get chocolate cake.
20572	Elliot	Oh, right, 'cause you're diabetic. Boo-hoo! You know what, Turk, if you want sympathy, get a disease people can see!
20573	Turk	Wow!
20574	Elliot	Oh my God, I am so sorry. I'm just having the worst day.
20575	Turk	It's no biggie. Forgive and forget, right?Please get her.
20576	Elliot	I have been kicking ass lately, but this place is such a boys' club I still can't even get x-rays or lab tests back on time.
20577	Carla	Hey, Elliot, if you're desperate to get things done, you could always do what Jordan does.
20578	Jordan	Could you move my car out of the sun? If the seat gets too hot, my thighs get all pink and sweaty.Yeah. Bye-bye, security guard.
20579	Elliot	Hm. Very classy.
20580	Jordan	Don't judge me, stick. You do what you have to do to level the playing field.
20581	Elliot	Well, Carla and I would never behave that way.
20582	Carla	Thank you.
20583	Elliot	How'd you get chocolate cake? He said they didn't have any!
20584	Carla	Oh. I just did like this and said, "Got cake?"

20589	Dr. Cox	Is it a set of adult male shoulders?
20590	J.D.	They had to trim them to get me out of that well.
20591	Dr. Cox	Oh, right.
20592	J.D.	Anyway, know Mr. Marks? He said he doesn't have any family to be a kidney donor? But he's got a son! We gotta find this guy!
20593	Dr. Cox	Look, Newbie, there are times a man wants to keep something to himself. Like, say, he's got a son. Or he's 29-years-old and keeps a journal with a unicorn drawn on the cover?
20594	J.D.	Ah, that's a horse with a sword on his head, and he's there to guard my hopes and dreams.
20595	Dr. Cox	Come on, if the guy didn't tell you about his son, I'm sure he had a pretty good reason. You know, you always do this you get too involved in your patients' lives. And just exactly how does that usually work out for ya?

20598	J.D.	Oh, God, no.He made me watch 'Everwood'.

20600	J.D.'s Narration	After getting more involved, I found out Mr. Marks's son was an air-traffic controller at a small private airport.
20601	Wings' Joe	Come on, Brian, I don't wanna do this
20602	Wings' Brian	Relax, will you? Relax. We're gonna put her on the speakerphone, if you don't like the sound of her voice, she's history.
20603	Murray	I'll tell you something about 'Wings' they really got it right.
20604	J.D.	Excuse me, are you Murray Marks?
20605	Murray	I'm busy.
20606	J.D.	You don't look busy.
20607	Speaker	Tower, this is flight 117. We've lost an engine.

20625	Murray	Yeah, but okay, but wouldn't it be funnier if I came on the second "I found his son," just to get to it?
20626	J.D.	Yeah, that would be a whole lot funnier. But I have a question: Who's gonna be singing the "I found his son" song? Because it certainly won't be me! Okay?
20627	Murray	Whoa!

20636	Murray	Before you say anything, I just want you to know if you need a kidney, you can have mine.
20637	J.D.	See?
20638	Murray	For seventy thousand dollars!
20639	Dr. Cox	I love this moment so much I want to have sex with it.
20640	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
20641	Elliot	Franklyn. I was wondering if you could put a rush on Mr. Lowenstein's urinalysis? Because I've got a really important interview for a fellowship next year.
20642	Franklyn	No. We're done talking now.
20643	Carla	Elliot. We can help.
20644	Turk	No! No. You will not turn Elliot into some flirtatious manipulator. I mean, don't get me wrong, outside the hospital, Elliot with her hair up is a slammin' hottie. But in here she's an asexual mess. And that's the natural order of things. And you don't mess with the natural order!
20645	Carla	Elliot, don't listen to him, he doesn't know what he's talking about.
20646	Elliot	Look, I will try anything. I just don't want to compromise who I am. Eh?
20647	Jordan	Sweetie, you won't have to do that! Sure, if it's something really important, you might have to occasionally sleep with someone. That's how I hooked up with Perry needed a pen.
20648	Carla	You won't have to compromise yourself. It's all about subtlety. It's...a lingering smilea chuckle at a bad jokea look in your eye that says, "If you do what I want maybe something will happen between us, even though you know it never will...."
20649	Elliot	Franklyn, if you analyze this urine sample right now, then maybe I'll have sex with you, but probably not.
20650	Carla	So close.
20651	J.D.	All right, we what's the problem with your dad?
20652	Murray	Well, for starters, he named me "Murray." That's an old man's name!
20653	J.D.	Oh, come on, no it isn't!
20654	Murray	MURRAY!Everything my father's ever done was designed to humiliate me.
20655	J.D.	Murray!
20656	Murray	What.
20657	J.D.	No, the youngest Murray!
20658	Old Murray	I'm sixty-eight!
20659	Murray	Thirty-four!You don't know what it was like having him as a father. He had me in his shadows my whole life. He actually sang at my senior prom. My date threw her panties on the stage first and last time I saw them, by the way.
20660	J.D.	Oh, come on, you're exaggerating.
20661	Mr. Marks	Heeeey, good lookin'! Whaaaa'cha got cookin'? How's about cookin' something up with me!
20662	Murray	See what I mean?
20663	J.D.	Shhh! I love this song.
20664	Mr. Marks	Ooooh. Thank you!
20665	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
20666	Elliot	Okay, so I tried to get some x-rays back from the lab tech by making a kissy face, and he asked me if I had palsy!
20667	Jordan	Elliot, if you want to get ahead, you have to use what God gave ya!
20668	Carla	Or in your case, what Dr. Fineberg gave you.
20669	Jordan	Exactly!
20670	J.D.	I can't keep my kidney guy's son from leaving.
20671	Carla	Elliot will help.You can do this!
20672	Elliot	Hi, I'm Elliot.
20673	Murray	Hi, I'm Murray.
20674	Elliot	Hi, I'm Elliot.
20675	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
20676	Elliot	Frick! These are my favorite scrubs! Is it a bad stain?
20677	Murray	No. That's a good stain. That's a very good stain. That's my favorite stain ever.
20678	Elliot	I did it!
20679	Jordan	She has nice breasts.
20680	Carla	They're real.
20681	Jordan	Yeah, right.
20682	J.D.	No, they are.
20683	Jordan	They're not.

20685	Murray	I can't believe you got cake! The guy said they didn't have any.
20686	J.D.	Just do what I told you to do.
20687	Glen	Sweets for the sweet.
20688	Murray	Thank you...Glen.
20689	J.D.	Look, Murray, it doesn't matter that your father's handsome and charismatic and sings like a young Joan Baez. He's your flesh and blood, and you gotta step up.
20690	Murray	Look, you obviously have some issues with your own father that you're projecting on to me. So why don't you go ahead and give him a jingle?
20691	J.D.	He's dead.
20692	Murray	Good stuff!
20693	J.D.	No, I'm serious.
20694	Murray	Classic!
20695	J.D.	He had like a massive heart attack.
20696	Murray	I'm sorry for your loss.
20697	J.D.	Now, about the kidney....
20698	Murray	I wish I could fly my plane right now. I always like to fly it when I have to make a big decision.
20699	J.D.'s Thoughts	Make the "flesh and blood" argument again but in a different way.
20700	J.D.	Blood and flesh, Murray.
20701	Murray	I'll do it!
20702	J.D.'s Thoughts	Jackpot!
20703	Murray	Yawning, Glen!
20704	J.D.	One for the road, Glen?Thanks! Happy weekend!

20706	Turk	Elliot, did you talk Franklyn into doing your patient's urinalysis before mine?
20707	Elliot	No, I just told him I lost my voice and had to whisper in his ear......like this.
20708	Turk	Careful, Elliot.
20709	Elliot	Oh, come on, what harm could come from a little flirting?
20710	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
20711	Janitor	Ah! I wanna see that engagement ring.
20712	Jeweler	That costs ten thousand dollars.
20713	Janitor	I got twelve bucks.
20714	Carla	You okay?
20715	Turk	Yeah, why?
20716	Carla	So she used her femininity! The only reason you usually get your lab-work back so fast is because you always pick Franklyn to play basketball, even though he always shoots his foul shots granny-style.
20717	Turk	This is different.
20718	Guy	Excuse me.
20719	Turk	This is gonna cause problems.
20720	Elliot	Oh, I'll just be a sec.
20721	Dave	It's on me.
20722	Guy	I'd like an orange soda too.
20723	Dave	Oh, I'm sorry, that was the last one. How sad.
20724	Guy	That's the way female doctors around here behave, I hope the young lady I'm interviewing is a different breed. Do either of you know where I can find Dr. Elliot Reid?
20725	J.D.'s Narration	"I told you so" moments are rare. So when they come, you have to savor them.
20726	Dr. Cox	Hey, Newbie! The good news is that Murray and his dad are a match, kidney-wise. The better news is that the test revealed a little secret you're gonna wanna share with your new pal. Gregory is not Murray's biological father!
20727	J.D.	Oh, no.
20728	Dr. Cox	By the by? This moment is so great, I'd cheat on that other moment from before, marry this one and raise a family of tiny little moments.
20729	J.D.	Dammit!
20730	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
20731	J.D.'s Narration	I couldn't decide whether I should tell Murray his dad wasn't his dad. Luckily hospitals are full of supportive colleagues eager to help.
20732	Dr. Kelso	Go tell that little bastard this second, before he coughs a kidney up to his fake father and sues this hospital!
20733	J.D.	Uh, actually, sir, it's a horse with a sword on his head.
20734	Unicorn	You know I'm a unicorn. Why can't you just say it?
20735	Dr. Kelso	What are you going to do, son?
20736	J.D.	Well, Dr. Kels Well, Dr. Kelso, I'm just gonna tell him. Murray's got a good heart, and he'll do the right thing.
20737	Murray	I'm outta here!
20738	J.D.	Murray!
20739	Old Murray	Whaaat?
20740	J.D.	Not you, Old Murray!
20741	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
20742	Carla	Okay! I put interview guy in the lounge and told him that Elliot was with a patient. Now. How we gonna fix this thing?
20743	Janitor	You're okay.
20744	Carla	Okay, here's the plan: Jordan and I will take care of interview guy. Soft-Scrub, you can do whatever the hell you want.
20745	Janitor	I will.Dammit! I told you to sparkle!
20746	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
20747	J.D.	He says he clears his head by flying his plane. But I went to his airport? He doesn't have a plane there! What should I do?
20748	Dr. Cox	Who gave you this number?
20749	J.D.	Come on, I'm really asking for your help here.
20750	Dr. Cox	Yeah, but, it's very important we focus on the whole "who gave you this number" issue.
20751	J.D.	Fine! Maybe I got too involved like you said. But would it kill you for once to acknowledge that my heart is in the right place instead of spending all your time berating me?
20752	Dr. Cox	You got the number from Jordan, didn't you. She hates me.
20753	J.D.	You've been great as usual.There you are! Hi, buddy!
20754	Murray	Hey...!Ohh, ohh! I'm a doctor! I'm a doctor! Everything can't get to me!
20755	J.D.	What an odd sized explosion.

20757	Carla	Elliot, your interviewer called, he's running late. Would you take Turk somewhere for me?
20758	Elliot	Where?
20759	Jordan	Oh. The, uh, honey festival!
20760	Elliot	Oh my God! Is that back in town?
20761	Carla	Sure is! And Turk would love to go with you.
20762	Elliot	You would?
20763	Turk	Yes. I love large groups of white people eating pollen.
20764	Emcee	On behalf of the honey festival, I would like to thank our two volunteers: Our taster, Elliot...And of course, Christopher, the human honeycomb.
20765	Turk	I thought you meant the cereal! Ow. Ow!
20766	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
20767	J.D.	Can I talk to you for a second?
20768	Speaker	Tower, are you there? I lost an engine!
20769	J.D.	I'm not falling for that crap again!
20770	Murray	This is real! Mickey's not here.
20771	Speaker	Oh, God! I lost another engine!
20772	Murray	Calm down, Frank. You left your engines in the storage shed.
20773	Speaker	Oh, there they are! Thanks, Murray.
20774	Murray	It's what I do.
20775	J.D.	Anyhoo, what do you think your dad is doing right now?
20776	Murray	He's not my dad, he's my fake dad. Which means what my fake cousin Samantha and I almost did in the tenth grade would have been beautiful...and right.
20777	J.D.	Been there with my gram-gram....
20778	Murray	Probably playing his stupid guitar.
20779	Mr. Marks	Ah, so maybe I wasn't the perfect dad. I mean, there were the occasional missed baseball games.... And the taking of his college sweetheart to the Bahamas for two weeks without telling him.... But I still don't see why he resents me this much.
20780	Dr. Cox	Boy, tell me about it. You know, I got this kid who constantly ignores my advice, and then flashes me the sad doe eyes every time I call him a girl's name or scream in his face.
20781	Mr. Marks	Do you wanna sing about him?
20782	Dr. Cox	No. Not ever.
20783	J.D.	Sometimes Dr. Cox is all over me, like every second of my life.
20784	Murray	Why do you keep talking about your boss like he's your father?
20785	J.D.	Remember? Recently deceased dad?
20786	Murray	Massive heart attack!
20787	J.D.	Yes! I mean, yes.
20788	Dr. Cox	You do know he's not yours, don'cha.
20789	Mr. Marks	I figured it out.
20790	Dr. Cox	'Course.
20791	Mr. Marks	But his real dad was such a jerk we just decided not to tell him.
20792	Dr. Cox	Yeah.

20794	Carla	Elliot! What are you doing here?
20795	Elliot	My interviewer called my cell phone. He has been waiting to talk to me!
20796	Jordan	What the hell?
20797	Turk	Woman, I was covered in bees!
20798	Carla	Elliot, wait!
20799	Elliot	Oh. Um...well, then I will just explain it to him. It'll be fine.Wait! Sir, just hear me out! It UGH!
20800	Turk	Ladies. I think we've learned our lesson.
20801	Jordan	That is not helpful, Turkleton!
20802	Turk	I was covered in bees!
20803	Carla	Oh my God, he's actually giving him an orange soda.
20804	Elliot	What happened?
20805	Janitor	He's gonna reconsider you.
20806	Elliot	How'd you do that?
20807	Janitor	Hey, buddy. I need you to reconsider Blonde Doctor. And I'm gonna tell you why. See, I'm the future Mr. Blonde Doctor? And I kinda need this to happen so that I can, uh hey, over here I need this to happen so that I can just hang out around the house and, you know, bake bread or...gab across the fence with neighbor Marge. Nice lady. Polish, I think. Doesn't matter, I'm not prejudice.
20808	Interviewer	What the hell are you talking about?
20809	Janitor	Here's the thing: I need you to take this can of orange soda, turn, smile, and give Blonde Doctor a big thumb's up! Or, I'm gonna take the same orange soda, follow you down to the parking lot, and smash your head in with it.We...talked about your future.

20811	Murray	I don't know if I can go through with this. I wish there was something to help me get through the door.
20812	Dr. Cox	Hey, jerk-hole.
20813	& Murray	Yeah?
20814	Dr. Cox	No, new jerk-hole! Now, no matter what you think of that guy in there, he always knew he wasn't your father but he stayed in the game anyway. So how's about you get your selfish ass in there.
20815	Murray	Okay.Hey.
20816	Mr. Marks	Hey.
20817	Murray	So, I got this extra kidney I'm not using.
20818	Mr. Marks	Are you sure?
20819	Murray	Yeah.
20820	Mr. Marks	You know I love you, right?
20821	Murray	Yeah, I know you do. I love you too, dad.
20822	Mr. Marks	Child arrived just the other day
20823	Murray	Dad.
20824	Mr. Marks	came into the world in the usual way.
20825	Murray	Dad. Dad!
20826	J.D.'s Narration	In a hospital, it's easy to take things too far. Still, sometimes you have to go too far to see where the line is.
20827	Elliot	Please, Franklyn?
20828	Franklyn	Oh, okay. Come with me, little friend.
20829	Elliot	Huh!
20830	J.D.'s Narration	As for me...
20831	Mr. Marks	Hey, good lookin'! Whaa'cha got cookin'...
20832	J.D.'s Narration	...Maybe I got too involved with Murray and his fake real dad. But as I watched Gregory serenade a clearly uncomfortable Murray, I realized something.
20833	Mr. Marks	Heeey, sweet baby! Dooon'cha think maybe...
20834	J.D.'s Narration	If Murray could look past his dad's imperfections and appreciate all the time he'd given him, maybe I owe Dr. Cox a thank-you for the same thing.
20835	J.D.	Hey. I just wanted to take a second to thank you for constantly berating me, doubting my abilities, and the overall devastation of my self-esteem.
20836	Dr. Cox	My pleasure.
20837	J.D.'s Thoughts	Now wrap it all up with a slow motion hand wave.Oh, I'm slooooow, baby.
20838	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
20839	J.D.	All the way from the parking lot! I told you I could do it! Who's the idiot now!
20840	J.D.'s Thoughts	Despite my burning thighs, giving Turk that piggyback ride was worth it. Because I'm sure it put him in a great mood.
20841	Turk	I'm in the worst mood.
20842	J.D.'s Thoughts	Why did I do it!?
20843	Turk	Kelso's got this new stupid outreach program where families are allowed to observe surgeries. Yesterday I had to do a bypass on this guy. You should have seen the family, standing there motionless, silently judging me.And today I gotta do a colectomy on that guy. What do you think his family is gonna be like?
20844	Woman	There's a tumor in there! There's a tumor in there!
20845	Guy	Ohh, don't go behind the kidney, brotha!
20846	J.D.	Shhhh!
20847	Turk	You didn't go to the black family yelling at the movie screen stereotype, did you?
20848	J.D.	Like a bear to honey.
20849	Turk	Oh, don't worry. I gotcha.
20850	J.D.	Buckle up, buddy!
20851	Turk	Hell yeah!
20852	J.D.	Hey, kids, I'm Dr. Dorian. I'm sure you have lots of questions, so let's get started.So, basically it's a topical application consisting of equal parts triethanolamine and phenyl dimethicone. I suggest applying it twice a day for extra hold. Okay? Here's a sample tube, Reuben. Excellent query.Okay, then, anybody else?
20853	Reuben	What was your best moment in medicine?
20854	J.D.	I-I'd say my best moment was probably my second year, New Year's Eve. A young pregnant woman could barely make it into the hospital, she had her baby right there on the ramp.
20855	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
20856	Blonde	You know, that's my first grandchild. Did you deliver?
20857	J.D.	No, I didn't. But I did watch. And I am a doctor. And you look amazing.So even though Dr. Mickhead actually delivered the kid, yours truly rang in the new year with grandma!We had sex.That's how I do it.
20858	Elliot	That was your best moment?
20859	Turk	I totally get it. Older ladies know how to work it!
20860	Carla	Okay, see, now you're in a bit of a pickle because the older lady you're talking about better not be me, and it sure as hell better not be somebody else. So whatta you have to say?
20861	Turk	Your favorite jeans are too tight and they look ridiculous!
20862	Carla	What!?
20863	Turk	Well, I I'm in trouble anyway and it needed to be said!
20864	Carla	Well, unfortunately for you that's just not true! Right?
20865	Turk	Heh!
20866	Carla	Wow.
20867	Todd	I'll tell you what my best moment in medicine was.
20868	Dr. Wen	Dammit, we lost him. Call it.
20869	Todd	I'm not giving up on this guy! Prop his hand up.
20870	Nurse	What?
20871	Todd	I said prop his hand up!That's right: The Miracle Five.
20872	Dr. Kelso	You take this one, Perry.
20873	Dr. Cox	Great moment, there, dumb-ass. It starts out with a profound misunderstanding of how the human body works, and winds up with you shattering some old man's hand.
20874	Todd	Oh, yeah.
20875	J.D.	You know what'd be really neat? If you guys all took a second and thought about what your best moment in medicine was.It woulda been neat.

20880	Tyler	Hi. That's my dad.
20881	Elliot	Except that.And that.
20882	Mr. Milligan	Just been so tired lately. Yesterday, when the little man and I were wrestling, he he dropped me in ten seconds.
20883	Tyler	I got him with a power kick.
20884	Carla	Hey! You brought Tyler a new ice cream cone!
20885	J.D.	Sure....
20886	Tyler	Thanks.
20887	J.D.	It's a waffle cone.
20888	Mr. Milligan	Don't you get that from kissing?
20889	J.D.	There are other ways you can get it.Dr. Cox.

20893	J.D.	She came out of nowhere!
20894	Mr. Milligan	Am I gonna get out of here in time for Christmas? Tyler's mom isn't around anymore, and I'd really hate to ship him off to his grandparents'.
20895	J.D.	You'll beat Santa home. I promise.
20896	Dr. Cox	Phyllis. Outside.What the hell was that in there?
20897	J.D.	Agh!That's one more point for Mrs. Cross. But let's see how she enjoys her beloved hard candy without ... her choppers!
20898	Dr. Cox	Newbie! You never promise a patient that they're gonna be fine!
20899	J.D.	Mr. Milligan? His blood pressure's a little low; he just has mono.
20900	Dr. Cox	Oh, for God's sakes, Newbie, take a look around, would you please? What's the difference between your Mr. Milligan and every other patient in this I.C.U.? And if the answer to that question is that he's the only one young enough to have never made a phone call like this: "Brring! Hello? Operator? Give me ," then you'd be right. But since I'm not in the mood to make some big, dramatic, sweeping statement, I'll just tell you this: God hates doctors, He truly does. You see all these old people in here? Well, any of 'em would give just about anything to be able to sashay off this planet, but most of 'em are gonna stay and they're gonna live forever and ever and ever. And your Mr. Milligan, well, it turns out he's just young enough to die. I mean, think about it: It's the holidays, there's a sweet little kid involved. Can't you just feel it?
20901	J.D.'s Narration	I did feel it. And I knew what Carla was gonna say before she said it.

20908	Patient	Ahh, I raise and breed ponies.
20909	Elliot	Ponies!Come on, Thunder! Can't be late for rounds again, let's go. Giddyup!
20910	Carla	Hey, Elliot? Would you keep an eye on Tyler, here, while we take care of his dad?
20911	Elliot	Hi! Yeah, I'm not that great with kids. They've got such tiny hands. It's creepy.
20912	Carla	I'm leaving now.
20913	Tyler	My dad's in the I.C.U. What does that mean?
20914	Elliot	Well, uh, Tyler, that stands for "Intensive Care Unit." It's where we put our patients who need extra care, like somebody who might need help breathing because their lung collapsed, or maybe they had a brain aneurysm, which is basically when a vessel ruptures and then blood pours into theYou know what, forget it.

20920	J.D.	I already ordered it.
20921	Dr. Cox	Well, I'd definitely give Mrs. Cross her teeth back.
20922	J.D.	That I will not do!
20923	Carla	Hey, J.D. Turns out Mr. Milligan doesn't have insurance. Dr. Kelso said once he's stable we have to bounce him to County.
20924	J.D.	Turk! Hey! If you go talk to Kelso for me, I'll give you this special Christmas gum.

20929	Dr. Kelso	I said, "I can't do it on my own!"
20930	Waiter	Excuse me, sir! A-a man just fainted over there! Are you a doctor?
20931	Dr. Kelso	Not this weekend, son.
20932	Turk	Dr. Kelso, I know you told Carla to bounce Mr. Milligan to County, but it's Christmas! So...what do you say?
20933	Dr. Kelso	I'd say get me a 3T form!
20934	Turk	3T f ? What's that?
20935	Dr. Kelso	That's Tough Titties, Turkleton!
20936	Turk	Oh, God.

20938	Elliot	So, uh...what do you want to be when you grow up?
20939	Tyler	A baseball player.
20940	Elliot	Yeah, well, I wanted to be a ballerina when I was little. But, according to my mom, six-year-olds with mild scoliosis and giant man-feet aren't dancer material. But the joke's on her, because I am currently waiting to hear if the Saint Martha's Community Theatre will let me work lights for their production of The Nutcracker. Heh.
20941	Tyler	Can I have some chocolate milk?
20942	Elliot	Here's a buck. There's a vending machine right outside that door.
20943	Nurse Roberts	Dr. Reid. Would you sign this for me, please?
20944	Elliot	Sure!
20945	Nurse Roberts	Minding my own business. How 'bout you?
20946	Elliot	Hopefully lighting the crap out of Saint Martha's auditorium!

20952	Dr. Mickhead	Thanks, Carla!
20953	Carla	You're welcome, doctor.
20954	Dr. Cox	Carla? What's goin' on up there?
20955	Carla	I'm sorry, I was just thinking about the last time a doctor actually listened to me. Sometimes I feel like
20956	Dr. Cox	Did you get the results of the scan?
20957	J.D.	They came back negative. I feel like we're missing something in his patient history.
20958	Carla	When he came in, Mr. Milligan said that he and his son had been wrestling and goofing around.
20959	Dr. Cox	Oh my God, he just might have goof-arounditis.
20960	J.D.	We should also check him for the silly-willies.
20961	Carla	It's okay, they're just stressed out.
20962	Janitor	Any time a doctor disrespects me, I respond with a little note.Wah. Worth it!

20964	Dr. Cox	Are you swanning this guy?
20965	J.D.	Look, I really don't need you checking up on me every five seconds, okay? I'm a doctor, and I have as much medical expertise as anyone in this place.Now what exactly is swanning?
20966	Dr. Cox	What?!
20967	J.D.	I'm kidding. Enough of the backseat doctoring I got this.
20968	J.D.'s Narration	Why does it seem like every time I take a stand, everything turns to crap?
20969	Elliot	I gave that kid some money and sent him outside the hospital, and now I can't find him.
20970	J.D.	I'm sorry, what?
20971	Turk	Kelso said, no insurance, you gotta stabilize the guy and then bounce him.
20972	J.D.	You gotta be kidding me.
20973	Dr. Cox	I'll tell you what, in about ten more minutes none of this is gonna matter, because this guy's circling the drain.
20974	J.D.	Why are you sick?
20975	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
20976	J.D.'s Thoughts	I can't figure this out. Maybe if we tried stress-dosed steroids?
20977	J.D.	I can't figure this out. Maybe if we tried stress-dosed steroids?
20978	Dr. Cox	Or maybe we could just fill a syringe with false promises and inject him with that. Hm! Says here you already got that one covered!
20979	J.D.	You know, try and discourage me all you want, because kites fly highest against the wind.
20980	Dr. Cox	What?
20981	J.D.	I'm a kite! I'm a big, beautiful kite! Fly!
20982	Carla	Wrestling.Remember? He said his kid dropped him with a power kick.
20983	J.D.	Kids can kick pretty hard. Maybe he ruptured his spleen?
20984	Dr. Cox	Get a stat abdominal CT.Great catch there, Carla.
20985	Carla	Thank you.

20987	J.D.'s words echo	"Think of your best moment in medicine...."
20988	Nurse	You can do this, Dr. Turk.
20989	Turk	Okay!Time!
20990	Dr. Wen	Well, it's official. Dr. Turk is now the fastest appendectomy in the hospital.
20991	Turk	In your face, Dr. Beardface!
20992	Dr. Beardface	It's Beardfacé!
20993	J.D.	What the hell are you doing?
20994	Turk	I got gummed.
20995	J.D.	Come on, it turns out Mr. Milligan has a ruptured spleen. We're prepping him for surgery in room C.
20996	Turk	That's the room where the family gets to observe.
20997	J.D.	So?
20998	Turk	So, dude, you don't understand. When I operate, I don't see a person, I see a machine with parts that need to be replaced and circuits that need to be rewired.
20999	J.D.	So you think you're a robot mechanic?
21000	Turk	As a surgeon, the more detached I am, the more focused I am. And it's pretty impossible to feel focused or detached when this guy's family's watching every move I make.
21001	J.D.	Well, I wouldn't worry about that. Mr. Milligan only has a son and Elliot lost him.
21002	Turk	Awesome! For me.
21003	J.D.	Ah.
21004	Turk	For me.

21006	Tyler	Is that fun?
21007	Dr. Kelso	No, son. It's work. But this body didn't happen by accident.
21008	Tyler	Well, you know what I think is fun? Baseball.
21009	Dr. Kelso	My son is a big baseball fan. Not so much playing it, but more the designing and sewing of uniforms.
21010	Tyler	That's neat.
21011	Dr. Kelso	No, it's not.
21012	Tyler	Maybe we can play catch sometime.
21013	Dr. Kelso	I hope so, young man.
21014	Elliot	Oh! Thank God, Tyler, there you are!
21015	Dr. Kelso	Mabel, this is Bob Kelso. Uh, what's say we juggle some things and see if we can't free-ride Mr. Milligan financially for a while, okay?Yes, this is really Bob Kelso!

21017	Elliot	Don't run off on me again, Tyler.
21018	Tyler	Sorry. I got scared. And when I get scared I hide. I know it's stupid....
21019	Elliot	It's not stupid! Wanna know where I used to hide when I used to get scared? This closet right here. And the one on the second floor. Oh, and there's also this broken MRI machine down in the basement. It's like my own private cocoon....
21020	Tyler	You really got scared?
21021	Elliot	Yeah. Everybody does here at first. Check this out.
21022	Tyler	Cool.
21023	Elliot	Hang in there, Steve.
21024	Steve	In med school, they never teach you how to deal with death
21025	Elliot	Steve'll be stronger if he gets through this on his own.
21026	Tyler	So, how did you stop being scared?
21027	Elliot	I just realized that people here need me to be brave. Just like your dad needs you to be brave for his operation.
21028	Tyler	Can I hold his hand?
21029	Elliot	They're not actually very big on that.
21030	Tyler	Can I at least watch?
21031	Elliot	Are you sure?Get it together, Steve!

21038	Carla	Oh, he got off your leash?
21039	Dr. Cox	Give me a break.Eh, it's a long story involving my son, a rum cake, and a low counter. Suffice to say that it turns out at first it's it's endearing to watch them bounce off of the walls. But, man, you take your eyes off 'em for one second and BAM! they got a bucket on their head and they're plowing right through your brand new flat screen TV. God save me, it was barely out of the box.
21040	Carla	He figured out that spleen thing, maybe you should get off his case.
21041	Dr. Cox	I would love to get off of his case. In fact, nothing would make me happier than to watch him walk into a patient's room and not feel that I have to run in after him and check up on everything.
21042	Carla	You wanna know what I think?
21043	Dr. Cox	...No.
21044	Carla	I think you know how good a doctor J.D. is, and whether you admit it or not, you have a great personal stake in his future. So don't pretend for one second that all this attention you throw at him is just for him, because it's also for you. As your friend, I'm telling you that if you want him to keep growing you oughtta back off of him once in a while.
21045	Dr. Cox	Carla
21046	Carla	And don't say anything, because you know I'm right and my jeans do look good.
21047	Dr. Cox	God, I hate Christmas. I really do.

21049	Turk	Uh, hey, Elliot? Can I talk to you in private?
21050	Elliot	Parlez-vous Français?

21052	Elliot	Turk, je crois que Tyler se sentirais mieux s'il pouvait observer l'opération, d'accord?
21053	Subtitle	I really think it would make Tyler feel better if he could watch, OK?
21054	Turk	J'ai ... euh ... Tour d'Eiffel pantalon.
21055	Subtitle	I have ... an ... Eiffel Tower ... in my pants.
21056	Elliot	What?
21057	Turk	Pamplemousse!
21058	Subtitle	Grapefruit!
21059	Tyler	Can I please stay?
21060	Turk	Yeah, kid, you could stay.
21061	Tyler	Dr. Turk? Thanks.
21062	J.D.'s Narration	None of us wanted to say what we were thinking: How vulnerable we felt. So we all just stood around, pretending to work, and waited for someone to come through that door and tell us how this was gonna end.
21063	Turk	Who's the man!
21064	J.D.	All right, you guys, we still got a lot of work to do. Turk, why don't you go check the post-op films in radiology; and Carla will transfuse back to a hemoglobin ten; and Elliot, why don't you take Tyler and go get us all ice cream immediately.I'm gonna go check on him. You wanna come?
21065	Dr. Cox	No. No, you got it.
21066	J.D.'s Narration	It's amazing how one patient can affect so many people.
21067	Med Student	Dr. Dorian? What was your best moment in medicine?
21068	J.D.	My best moment...? Well, there was this guy...
21069	Elliot	...he had the most amazing little kid...
21070	Carla	...and the doctors actually listened to me...
21071	Turk	...I knocked the surgery right out the park...
21072	Dr. Kelso	...and I decided to pull some strings for the guy...
21073	Dr. Cox	...and honest to God, I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it myself, but Newbie handled the whole thing wire to wire...
21074	J.D.	...and I kept my promise. Because the two of them got home in time for Christmas. And that was my best moment in medicine.

21076	J.D.'s Narration	It's been a long road, but over the past two months, Elliot and I have totally rebuilt our friendship.

21078	Elliot	Good morning!
21079	J.D.	Co-chiefy, got you a little som'n-som'n!
21080	Elliot	Thank you! And I actually got you a little something....
21081	J.D.	A magnifying glass?
21082	Elliot	Yes.... For these.
21083	J.D.	You got the tiny post-its! Aww, awesome! For our tiny bulletin board! Aaaand I have a dentist appointment that got moved to Tuesday at 4 PM. "Don't floss before you come in, it makes your gums bloody"! Aww!
21084	J.D.'s Narration	Bottom line together, Elliot and I are the greatest co-chief residents of all time.
21085	Dr. Cox	You two are, without a doubt, the worst co-chief residents of all time. And in case you haven't noticed, we've got ourselves one hospital chock-full of monkey interns; and, news-flash, your job is to catch whatever they're flinging. Coffee talk, ladies, is now officially over. Get your asses to work. Now.
21086	J.D.	Cream?
21087	Elliot	Please!
21088	J.D.'s Narration	Yep, not even Dr. Cox could faze us. Because we had every facet of this job down.We figured out a fair way to schedule all the interns' shifts....
21089	J.D.	Okay, whoever gets Dr. Reid's scrub top back to her first doesn't have to work this weekend! Commence the scuffle!
21090	Elliot	I hope it doesn't rain today.
21091	J.D.	Me too.
21092	Female Intern	My eye!
21093	Lonnie	Ow! My lip!
21094	J.D.'s Narration	We knew how to protect the interns from Dr. Kelso.
21095	Dr. Kelso	Look, Brent, is it? Son, please tell me you come with a money back guarantee, because I'd like to get something useful like a can of Brent remover! I mean, for God's sa
21096	J.D.	sake, Brent! When are you gonna wake up and use that
21097	Elliot	rock that you have been calling your skull?!
21098	J.D.	We got this.
21099	Elliot	I mean, even a blind squirrel occasionally finds a nut! And
21100	J.D.	He's gone. He's gone.
21101	Elliot	Heh, look, Brent, you are doing fine.
21102	J.D.'s Narration	Still, it's not like we didn't keep the interns on their toes.
21103	J.D.	So, Lonnie, get in here and see the effects of cirrhosis of the liver.
21104	Elliot	J.D.! You knew I was gonna do that!
21105	J.D.	But it was still very startling!
21106	Daisy	Here's your shirt, Dr. Reid.
21107	Elliot	Wow, Daisy! Enjoy your weekend, you little scrapper!
21108	J.D.	Oh, Daisy, I'm supposed to ask you can Lonnie have his lower lip back?
21109	Daisy	It's my trophy.
21110	Nurse Roberts	Hey, this guy's coding.
21111	J.D.'s Narration	Don't get me wrong, I can handle a code. But every so often, every single thing that can conceivably go wrong with a patient goes wrong at once.
21112	Nurse Roberts	He's in VF.
21113	Nurse #1	We've lost an airway.
21114	Nurse #2	He's blown a pupil.
21115	J.D.	Okay, just gimme a second, all right?
21116	J.D.'s Narration	I call these "train wreck codes," and they're not my forte.
21117	Elliot	J.D., I've got your back. Laverne, bolus with amiodarone, get me the crash cart, grab me a central line kit, I'll bag him. Run the fluids wide open.
21118	J.D.'s Narration	I honestly didn't understand how she could do so many things at once.
21119	Elliot	14 Across: Four letters, "Band that sang 'Roseanna'"?
21120	J.D.	Toto!T-O-T-O Toto.
21121	Elliot	Okay, he's stable.
21122	J.D.'s Narration	See, my problem is that I've just never been much of a multi-tasker. For instance, I can't eat and watch T.V. Or drive my scooter and answer my phone.
21123	J.D.	Hello?Whooooa! Oh God, oh God! Look out, look out, look out, look out, look out!
21124	Woman	Agh!
21125	J.D.	Look out, lady! Look out! Look out!
21126	Lonnie	What the?
21127	J.D.	Look out!
21128	J.D.'s Thoughts	Scared Lonnie again!
21129	J.D.	Whoa, whoa, whoa!
21130	J.D.'s Thoughts	Tater tot!
21131	Janitor	Over here! I'll get you back outside!
21132	J.D.	Whoooooooooooaaaaaaaaaa!Whoever this is, you are not gonna believe what just happened to me!

21139	Janitor	If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
21140	Elliot	You know that guy that crashed this morning is doing great?
21141	Dr. Cox	Oh, Barbie. Maybe you could take a break from congratulating yourself and figure out what's wrong with Mrs. Kasuba over there, seeing as you're her doctor and she's been in the I.C.U. for three days.
21142	Elliot	We're, um, running lots of tests.
21143	Dr. Cox	Tests? Oh , goody! And what exactly will you be looking for? And if it's the slowest doctor in the hospital, then ding! ding! ding! ding! I already found her. Figure it out.
21144	J.D.'s Narration	See, this is why it doesn't bother me that Elliot is so much better with the train wreck codes. Her biggest weakness is my biggest strength diagnosis.
21145	J.D.	Elliot, if you need help, just ask Dr. Diagnosis. You could be my side-kick! Bangs McCoy!

21147	J.D.'s Narration	Lately it seemed like Turk was being a little casual about his diabetes.
21148	Turk	Okay, you all know the rules. I test my blood sugar, you bet high or low, and twenty-five percent goes to diabetes. Because if we all work hard, together...I can get a big-ass flat screen.
21149	Carla	That's right, baby!
21150	Turk	Mm-hmm.
21151	Nurse Roberts	I want high.
21152	J.D.	Low and slow, that's his tempo!
21153	Elliot	This game is sick. High.
21154	Turk	194.
21155	Carla	That high, baby? You've been sneaking brownies, haven't you?
21156	Turk	I'm gonna name him Gizmo.
21157	J.D.	That's what we were gonna name our robot!
21158	Turk	Oh, well, when we get the robot, we'll just name him TuPac.
21159	J.D.	"TuPac, may I please have some waffles?" "Would you like some sy-rup?" Yeah, that'd be fine. It'll work. It's a good idea.
21160	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21161	Elliot	Maybe Mrs. Kasuba has a perinephric abscess?
21162	J.D.	No, her pain is central, not near the back. Come on, Bangs! You know what helps me when I'm diagnosing? Mentally picturing everything. Like those sugar packets there. How do you think they got there?
21163	Elliot	Somebody probably knocked them over.
21164	J.D.	I don't think so. You see, the packets are neatly stacked. Plus that coffee cup has the lipstick of a certain very hot Nurse Tisdale.
21165	Todd	If you're looking for sugar, there's some on the floor.Thonnnnnnng!
21166	J.D.	It's the classic Todd Thong Sugar Trap.
21167	Elliot	Wow.
21168	J.D.	Now, let's apply the same thing to Mrs. Kasuba. We know this isn't the first time she's experienced abdominal pain. What else do we know about her?
21169	Elliot	Oh, you know what, J.D.? Um, I've gotta run. Are you okay here?
21170	J.D.	Yeah, I got this.
21171	Dr. Cox	Say, that was some real Nancy Drew stuff, there...Nancy. I mean, absolutely irrelevant as far as medicine goes, but damn amusing!
21172	J.D.	Don't feel weird because you're threatened by my gift. Many are.
21173	Dr. Cox	Did you feel that you weren't quite annoying enough without adding a delusional sense of grandeur? Because I promise you, you are annoying enough. In fact, you're the number one contender for the middle weight annoyance crown.
21174	J.D.	Well, you're the number one jealous...weight for the jealous weight... jealous ch-champ.
21175	Dr. Cox	He's done it! He's done it! Dorian's the Most! Annoying! Man in the World! Who would've ever thought a journeyman annoyer like Dorian might....
21176	J.D.	You are a close second!
21177	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21178	Carla	I have a couple of announcements. There's a serious problem around here with not getting to know our patients. Yes, the doctor told you to administer Halidol, but why is he prescribing it? Does the patient have a chance of sundowning or is he prone to psychotic breaks and needs to be tied down? You have to ask these questions, right Tammy?
21179	Tammy	Mm-hmm.
21180	Nurse Roberts	Child, we are swamped. Where you think we're gonna get that kind of time?
21181	Carla	Laverne, if you care you'll go the extra mile. Like my husband. Turk?
21182	Turk	Hm?
21183	Carla	You have three patients on the floor. What can you tell us about them?
21184	Turk	Well, I'm cutting out that guy's appendix, I'm sewing up her lacerated spleen, and I'm slicing off that dude's foot.
21185	Carla	Great. And why are you doing those things?
21186	Turk	Because it says so on the charts.What'd I do?
21187	Elliot	J.D.! You up for some coffee?
21188	J.D.	I can't. I've almost got Mrs. Kasuba's condition figured out.
21189	Janitor	Hey, I'll, uh, join you for a cup of mud.
21190	Elliot	Great! Meet me downstairs in five minutes.
21191	Janitor	I'll be there. Just let me wash this, uh, glue off my hands.
21192	J.D.	What was he gluing?Not again.I can't believe you're going on a date with the Janitor!
21193	Elliot	J.D., it's just coffee. It's not a date.
21194	Janitor	Milady.
21195	Elliot	I have to go.

21197	Turk	Baby, don't be mad, you know about surgeons. We're hammers, and our patients are nails. And hammers don't get to know nails; they hammer them. Why? Because...hammers.
21198	Carla	For the last time, Turk, I'm not gonna call you The Hammer.
21199	Turk	Yeah, but none of the other hammers get to know their patients.
21200	Carla	Yeah, well, none of them get to do what you did to me last night either.Come on, Buppie, give it to me.See? When I clap my hands at the same time, it looks totally real.
21201	Turk	I know. Let's go freak out J.D.!Okay, fine, I'll try. One condition: Gimme some!
21202	Ted	Oh my God!
21203	Dr. Kelso	I think it, and she does it!
21204	J.D.	Acute intermittent porphyria! I figured it out! All right, who's got Dr. Cox's pager number?Oh, who'm I kidding, I've got my Perry's Pager Song.
21205	J.D.'s Thoughts	"Dr. Cox at my door, pager 324."
21206	J.D.	There it is. Laverne, I'm gonna need you to get Mrs. Kasuba started on IV dextrose and hemotin.
21207	Nurse Roberts	Dr. Reid already ordered that.
21208	J.D.	She what?
21209	Elliot	Um, you know what, J.D., I've gotta run. Are you okay here?
21210	J.D.	She figured it out before me.
21211	J.D.'s Narration	There are a lot of things that can knock a guy on his ass.
21212	Turk	All right now, before we start, just in case my wife asks and she probably will what did this guy do to get his foot cut off?
21213	J.D.'s Narration	Whether it's catching a glimpse of what the future might hold....
21214	Surgical Nurse	He has diabetes.
21215	J.D.'s Narration	Or realizing you've just done the most embarrassing thing in your life.
21216	Janitor	Stupid Janitor. Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid.
21217	J.D.'s Narration	But even that's not as bad as it can get.
21218	J.D.	Why didn't you tell me?
21219	Elliot	I just thought that after I bailed you out of that train wreck code that you could, you know, use a win.
21220	Dr. Cox	Great diagnosis there, Barbie.
21221	Elliot	It wasn't me. J.D. figured it out.
21222	Dr. Cox	Well, then, nice job, Nancy.
21223	J.D.'s Narration	The worst thing is realizing when a friend is taking pity on you.

21225	J.D.'s Narration	I've never been a great liar.
21226	J.D.	Lookin' straight, Bruce.
21227	J.D.'s Narration	That's why I knew it'd be better for me if I just fessed up to Dr. Cox.
21228	J.D.	Elliot diagnosed Mrs. Kasuba, not me.
21229	Dr. Cox	I know. And your guilty anguish is it's delicious. It's like a little mini-meal between lunch and dinner. Quite frankly, it's all I can do not to grind pepper on your head.
21230	J.D.	I don't get it. When did she become a better doctor than me?
21231	Dr. Cox	Probably during one of those countless times you were goofing off?
21232	J.D.	Eh! As soon as I step foot in this hospital, I'm all business.Good morning, Dr. Cox! From the world's most giant doctor!Well, that was outside the hospital. Plus, Elliot was the legs. Sure, she's skinny, but she's thick through the trunk.
21233	Dr. Cox	You're finally at that stage where you and your equally undistinguished colleagues have all had enough training to be able to help each other. So no matter how humiliating it may seem, if you know somebody who's better than you and I'm bettin' that you do? you had best tuck that ridiculously feminine tail of yours between your legs and go ask her for help. I'm thinkin' that's just about it. Yep. I, uh, gosh, I'm all out of speeches. I don't think I have, uh, another one on me. I...I don't. The Oh. These are...my goodbye guns.
21234	J.D.	Those aren't real guns.

21236	Carla	Why is my stapler on the floor?
21237	Todd	Thonnnnnnnng!Face-five! Oh, yeah!
21238	Turk	Oh, you taught Todd the slap thing?
21239	Carla	Nope. How was surgery?
21240	Turk	Oh, it was fine.
21241	Nurse Roberts	Honey bear! You look blue. Have a cookie.
21242	Carla	Nah-ah-ah, Laverne. No more jackin' up my man's blood sugar just so you can buy yourself a camper.
21243	Turk	So this is all a big joke to you guys? 'Cause this is my life, and I don't think it's funny.
21244	Nurse Roberts	Now I gotta try to get back in on that craps game in the basement.

21246	Janitor	I don't know, this whole Blonde Doctor situation has me mortified. I've gathered the brain trust here to help me figure a way out of this.
21247	Randall	Uh-oh, bro. There she is.
21248	Troy	You want me to hobble her?
21249	Janitor	That's not hobbling, that's that's...poking. What's the matter with you? Here's a chance to learn a lesson as a group, okay? Sometimes you've just gotta face the music and own up to what you've done.Hi...Blonde Doctor. Um, before, when we almost had coffee? Uh, I feel like I made you feel uncomfortable.
21250	Elliot	No, I...wasn't, um
21251	Janitor	Well, it-it you know the only reason I was wearing the suit at all was because our, uh, a cappella band was...practicing.
21252	Elliot	Oh, that's great! What's your band's name?
21253	Janitor	Uh.... It's, uh, Hibbleton. Yeah, yeah. And, um, I don't think it's going too far to say that we're the best hospital employee band in town.
21254	Ted's Band	Oh, really?
21255	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21256	J.D.	I'll clear his airway!
21257	Elliot	His O2-sat is dropping, his abdomen is distended, we need you to do a lavage. What are you gonna do?
21258	J.D.	Dammit!
21259	Elliot	J.D., it's okay. Look, it's good practice. It's why we're down here.
21260	Doug	You know, I don't really like you guys playing with my cadavers.
21261	Elliot	Oh, really, Doug? So how come that one over there has a soda in his hand?
21262	Doug	He keeps it cold!
21263	J.D.	And how come when we walked in you were sitting in a circle with three corpses playing Texas hold 'em?
21264	Doug	Just call first from now on!
21265	J.D.	I just, I don't know what to do when everything goes wrong at once. It's it's it's overwhelming.
21266	Elliot	You wanna know what my big secret is? Just take one big breath. Everything will slow down and you can just tackle each thing as it comes.
21267	J.D.	That's your big secret? Breathing?
21268	Elliot	Why do you have such a problem with me teaching you stuff?
21269	J.D.	It's just that you're a little smug.
21270	Elliot	You called yourself Dr. Diagnosis and made me your side-kick. J.D., you've been the golden boy around here for the past three years while I have cried in closets and hid from Dr. Cox and relied on you every single day to get me through it. I mean, now that I am finally doing well enough to pay you back, maybe you can tell me why you're being such an unbelievable jerk?
21271	J.D.	Because you're the one that's supposed to struggle not me.
21272	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21273	Carla	Baby. What's going on with you?
21274	Turk	Ever since I got this thing? I've been joking around about it, sneaking cookies, and hiding from it. All because I'm scared to ask myself the questions: Is it gonna get worse? Or are our kids gonna have it? Or how old am I gonna be when it finally gets me? ...You don't understand.
21275	Carla	I don't understand? Turk, look at me, I'm a WOD.
21276	Turk	I keep trying to tell you this, but it's the mirror in the bathroom, baby. You haven't gained a pound since I met you!
21277	Carla	No, I'm a WOD Wife Of Diabetic. That's what they call us in all the diabetic chat rooms. I spend a lot of time on the computer, talking about how proud I am of my husband and how he's handling this. How he's able to make jokes about it and money. It's okay to be afraid, I am. But I have to tell you, I don't know what I would do if you suddenly became someone who let something own you.
21278	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21279	Ted's Band	Ah, but would I like it? No, not much.... No, not much!
21280	Janitor	Yeah! Well, you win! Heh.

21282	Elliot	Your your band didn't even sing yet.
21283	Ted's Band	Aww.
21284	Janitor	There's no need. You win!
21285	Ted's Band	Woo.
21286	Elliot	Oh, come on, Janitor? For me?
21287	Janitor	One second. Bring it in.Oh, God.... Okay, I don't ask for much, just a little help with a stain every now and then. I'd like to be able to communicate with animals.... But right now, oh boy, we need a miracle.Heh. Ahem. ...Bah...bah...bah...

21289	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21290	J.D.'s Narration	I suddenly found myself looking down on Mr. Kravitz, Elliot's train wreck patient from this morning. Apparently the irony wasn't lost on him either.
21291	J.D.	You gotta be kidding, Mr. Kravitz. Twice?
21292	Nurse	BP's dropping.
21293	Nurse Roberts	He's becoming bradycardic.Doctor!

21299	J.D.	To you!
21300	Elliot	Cheers!
21301	J.D.	Oh, Elliot, that's impossible. I mean, I know you've got strong legs, and you're
21302	Dr. Cox	I need you to place an IV on the second floor, room 208.
21303	J.D.	Greetings! Ha ha! Ha ha! I'm the world's most, most giant doctor! Whoa!
21304	Elliot	Oh!
21305	J.D.	Little help? Little help!
21306	Dr. Cox	Sure, sure, sure.
21307	J.D.	Yeah, sure. Not that kind of help. Agh.If I let go, will you guys catch me?Well, I'm going for it anyway!Lonnie? Lonnie!
21308	Lonnie	I...hate you, J.D.

21310	J.D.'s Narration	Being a great doctor isn't just about medical knowledge, it's also about people skills.
21311	J.D.	Wow, that is the worst broken nose I have ever seen.
21312	Woman	I'm here because I stepped on a nail.
21313	J.D.	Of course.
21314	J.D.'s Thoughts	Were you walking on your nose?
21315	J.D.	Unfortunately you're gonna have to wait a little bit longer, okay? 'Cause we admit people by severity of condition.That was mortifying.
21316	Woman	AAAAGGGGHHH! MY FACE! OWWWWWW! Owowowowowowow!
21317	J.D.	You know, with the face burns we could probably admit you now. Laverne?Agh!
21318	J.D.'s Thoughts	My "me time" hand!
21319	Carla	Oh, and two, you know, Friday night there's a chamber orchestra playing in the courtyard of the museum.
21320	Elliot	Oh, I'd love that!
21321	Carla	You wanna go?
21322	Elliot	Oh my God, I love Pachelbel!
21323	Carla	We can go right after....
21324	J.D.'s Narration	Carla and Elliot were going through their weekly ritual of making plans they were never going to keep.
21325	Elliot	...Um...
21326	Carla	We should have dinner beforehand.
21327	Elliot	Perfect!
21328	J.D.'s Narration	And since Turk knew these were fake plans, he used the opportunity to score bonus points with his wife. Classic husbanding.
21329	Turk	Hey, baby! You know what? Forget dinner I'll make you a homemade picnic basket.
21330	Elliot	Oh!
21331	Carla	I married an amazing man.
21332	Turk	You sure did! You know what? I've got an even better idea. Maybe J.D. and I can both come right? we'll wear sport coats, and you guys, beautiful dresses!
21333	Elliot	Oh my God, I love that idea!
21334	Carla	I love it. I love it. It's awesome. It's awesome!
21335	J.D.'s Narration	To be perfectly honest, so did I. I never get an opportunity to wear my houndstooth sports coat.
21336	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21337	J.D.'s Narration	Unlike Elliot and Carla, when Turk and I made plans we kept them.
21338	Turk	It's 10 o'clock. You ready?
21339	J.D.	Let's do it.
21340	J.D.'s Narration	But lately for us, our plans rarely involved leaving the apartment.
21341	Turk	I wasn't too excited about taking over this spot after you sat in it for twenty minutes, but I gotta tell ya, it's warm in all the right places.
21342	J.D.	Mm-hmm.
21343	Turk	How do you like what I left you over there?
21344	J.D.	Oh, man, your ass indentation is so deep, it's like I'm sitting in a giant inner tube.
21345	J.D.'s Narration	As Turk and I recuperated from our big chair swap, I wondered what other couples were doing tonight. Did I just refer to Turk and I as a couple? My point is, I'm sure other couples were out having fun.
21346	Dr. Cox	You look so hot. When's the last time we kissed?
21347	Jordan	About a month ago.
21348	Dr. Cox	When's the last time we had sex?
21349	Jordan	Yesterday.
21350	Dr. Cox	Whatta you say we head into the bathroom of this place and lower the health code rating from an A to a B? Whatta you say?
21351	J.D.'s Narration	I guess some people figure, What's the worst that can happen?
21352	Dr. Cox	Well?
21353	Jordan	It's blue. I'm not pregnant.
21354	Dr. Cox	Ohh.
21355	Jordan	You know what's weird? I'm relieved, I just feel...kinda sad, because I think about how beautiful our son is and I...kinda wish it had gone the other way, you know?Sweetie?

21360	Jerry	I always thought that when I died I'd see a bright light or float above the ground. Turns out death is pretty mundane. I guess sometimes the end...is just the end.
21361	J.D.	For the last time, Jerry, you're not dead! Okay? Now go back to your room!Jerry has Cotard's, or "walking corpse," Syndrome. The guy thinks he's dead even though he's walking around.
21362	J.D.'s Thoughts	I think I'll try to ask Turk something telepathically.
21363	Turk	Dude, yeah. Let's hang out and watch some TV. We got any beer?
21364	J.D.	I think I used the last of it to make our special party ice.
21365	Carla	Hey! If I accidentally put beer cubes in my orange juice again, there's gonna be trouble. I almost got a D.U.I. because of you guys!
21366	Turk	Do you mean an Irish brother or an Irish...bruthah?Top of the mizzle to ya, me lizzles.
21367	Carla	I mean his sibling.
21368	J.D.	Aw, man.And you must be the Irish brother.
21369	Conscious Guy	No, sir. Ron Pearson, Ohio born and bred. Yep, red-stater and proud of it.
21370	Turk	Oh, sorry, we

21375	Elliot	Carla.... I'm so bummed. I can't go see the chamber orchestra tonight I totally forgot I have my Cantonese class. And I would totally call and cancel, but the only thing I know how to say is "I'm allergic to peanuts."
21376	Carla	Ohh, Elliot, I was really looking forward to this!
21377	Elliot	Oh.
21378	Janitor	Really? 'Cause about five seconds ago you were all giddy about going home and taking a bath tonight.
21379	Carla	Why would you do that to me?
21380	Janitor	New thing: I'm bustin' chops.
21381	Elliot	So...you just forgot we even had plans?
21382	Carla	What's the big deal? You were flaking on them anyway.
21383	Elliot	I wasn't. I have my Cantonese class.
21384	Janitor	But do you? Do you really?Bustin' chops.
21385	Elliot	Fine! At least I remembered the plans well enough to flake on them!
21386	Carla	Oh, yeah? Well, if I knew you were gonna flake on them, I would've never made plans to forget in the first place, 'cause you...
21387	Dr. Cox	She's gone, Carla. It's over.
21388	Carla	Where the hell have you been for the last few days?
21389	Dr. Cox	Deep-sea fishing.
21390	Carla	You hate fishing.
21391	Dr. Cox	Went with my buddies.
21392	Carla	You don't have any buddies.
21393	Dr. Cox	Oh, yeah? Well, we landed a two hundred pound white marlin off the coast of San Diego.
21394	Janitor	Interesting. 'Cause that's three thousand miles from the natural habitat of the white marlin. Hmm. Well, perhaps it hopped a train from Cape Cod!
21395	Dr. Cox	Why!?
21396	Janitor	I'm bustin' chops today. You can ask anybody.
21397	Carla	It's true.
21398	Janitor	See?
21399	Carla	So what did you really do? And why are you limping?
21400	Jordan	Perry!
21401	Dr. Cox	I got a vasectomy. Do not tell Jordan!

21410	Billy	FINE! Pink hearts, yellow moons, orange stars, green clovers.
21411	J.D.	See! I told ya!He's Irish!
21412	Turk	Yeah he is, yeah he is!

21414	J.D.	Ohh, no, man, we're just living together. And not like, like, livin' together, I mean, like, liiiivin' together!
21415	Billy	Oh, yeah, I got this, I snuck onto a plane, thought it was going to Belgium, ended up in Kenya. Long story short, I hung out with this tribe; when the males go through adolescence, they get this tattoo. It means "alias."
21416	J.D.	Oh, why "alias"?
21417	Billy	It's their favorite show.I'm only kiddin'. I don't know what it means.Enough about me. What about you lads, you know, saving lives here all day every day? Out at night, givin' out a lash, tearin' it up? You do go out at night, don't ya?
21418	J.D.	Do you have any sevens?Turk!You have lots of sevens!We tear it.
21419	Turk	And and and sometimes lash, but with the hours we work, it's....
21420	J.D.	It's less tearing and more folding.
21421	Turk	Right.
21422	J.D.	Gently folding.
21423	Turk	Yeah.
21424	Billy	Lads! You're sleepin' off and you're dead and buried. You have to get out in the streets, you have to talk to a stranger. Drink a beer with breakfast! Take the ugliest girl home at the party!
21425	J.D.	Done it! Done that. That one I've done.
21426	Billy	Go travelin' to Texas, you know? Go line dancing with some married women that wish they weren't married. You never know what life would put in your lap when you open your arms and embrace it!
21427	J.D.	"You'll be surprised what'll fall in your lap if you open up and embrace life..."
21428	Turk	Dude.
21429	J.D.	Elliot!
21430	Elliot	He said my eyes look like the Irish countryside after a soft rain. Ahem. I should go.
21431	J.D.	That happened very quickly.
21432	Turk	Don't even sweat it. It's Elliot. She's desperate!
21433	J.D.	Dude.
21434	Turk	Baby!
21435	Carla	What? What? I wasn't gonna do anything! He said my hair was curly.

21439	Dr. Cox	What, uh, what did you do around the apartment while I was gone?
21440	Jordan	Oh! I turned your little office into my pajama closet, I threw out everything in the 'frigerator that had the word "jerky" or "whiz" on it, I got rid of all your clothes that make you look like you're twenty years old don't worry, I saved your hockey jerseys. Although I did move them into my new...pajama closet! And for some reason none of the remotes work anymore. And why are you limping?
21441	Dr. Cox	Fishing? I'm limping from fishing.
21442	Dr. Kelso	I know that limp.
21443	Dr. Cox	No, Bob. Bob, no.
21444	Dr. Kelso	You just got a vasectomy! I had mine done back in '68. Ironically, that was the same year that Enid discovered pasta and I discovered I'm not attracted to enormous women.
21445	Dr. Cox	I didn't just get a vasectomy.
21446	Dr. Kelso	Come on, soldier! If I have to force you to drop your pants, I will!

21468	Todd	I'm going in!
21469	J.D.'s Narration	The crazy thing is most assumptions could be avoided if you just asked a simple question in the first place.

21473	Turk	Billy, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

21475	J.D.	Well, then, you're gonna have to deal with me and my partner.I mean, like, my my partner, not like my my partner.
21476	Turk	Can I talk to you outside for a second?
21477	Billy	How you doing?
21478	Jerry	Not great, actually. I'm dead.
21479	Billy	Bummer. How long?
21480	Jerry	Four years next month.
21481	Billy	Geez, that's a nightmare. I was dead once, for about ten minutes. Then me mate Danny peed on me head.
21482	Jerry	Really.
21483	Billy	It's quite a sight to wake up to, though.
21484	Turk	Heard you guys were fighting.
21485	Carla	We made up.
21486	Janitor	No they didn't.Chop bustin'. And doc dustin'.
21487	Turk	Well, Elliot, you don't look too banged up about it you got your arm around Carla.
21488	Elliot	My hand is stuck in this rat's nest that she calls hair!
21489	Carla	Dye job!
21490	Nurse Roberts	Got it! But, Chopstick, you're gonna have to buy a new watch. And Carla, you may wanna borrow some of my spray-on hair.
21491	Turk	Baby
21492	J.D.	No, dude, forget them. We have to deal with Billy. Now, should we call the cops on this guy or what?
21493	Turk	I don't know, man, he seems cool.
21494	J.D.	He put a guy in the hospital; that's a felony. And as doctors we're supposed to report him.
21495	Turk	Are you trying to convince me to do something that you already did? 'Cause you know that drives me crazy!
21496	J.D.	No! This is a decision we both need to make! Together! As a team, as a unit!
21497	Turk	All right, fine, let's call the cops.
21498	J.D.	Thank God.
21499	Policeman	Hello, gentlemen. We got a call about a felony from a Dr. Turk?
21500	J.D.	"Turk"'s easier to hear over the phone.
21501	J.D.'s Narration	"Dorian" isn't hard to hear over the phone. But I didn't really want to talk about it with Turk.
21502	Dr. Cox	I went behind Jordan's back and got my junk rewired. She was sweet to me. Sweet, Bobbo. What the hell do you make of that?
21503	Elliot	Carla thinks she's so tough, you know? She's "been around the block." She's "from the block." Enough about the block! It's not my fault my family had an orchard.
21504	Carla	For four years I've had to listen to Elliot complain about her problems. "My parents are too rich." "I slept with J.D. again." "Why can't I gain any weight?" I have problems of my own! I'm from the block!
21505	Jerry	I wanted to help her, I just wish she could've heard me.
21506	Carla	Okay, Jerry, you're out.
21507	Nurse Roberts	Mm-hmm?
21508	Carla	Can I talk to you?
21509	Dr. Kelso	Perry, believe me when I say I'm proud to welcome you to what I like to call the "seedless grapes club." But still....
21510	Janitor	I have just one obvious and hopefully chop-busting question....
21511	Nurse Roberts	Why the hell are you talking to me about this?
21512	Carla	I guess I should be talking to her.
21513	Dr. Cox	Jordan? Jordan, why aren't you more upset about this? I, honest to God, I don't get it. I mean, normally you'd go to your mother's for a bitch refresher course, and then you'd come right back here just swinging for the fences.
21514	Jordan	You know what, I'd love to stay and chat, but if we're late for ballet, Jack won't get a spot by the bathroom and then he'll pee in his tights.
21515	Dr. Cox	I'm sorry, my son is taking...is taking ballet? Come on, Jordan, he's already got an overbearing mother and a fairly prominent lisp. If we stick him in the tights, well, we might as well just go ahead and get him a timeshare on Fire Island.
21516	Jordan	Oh, I haven't even decided if I'm gonna make him gay yet.
21517	Dr. Cox	Oh. I see what this is. This is "the payback," ah?
21518	Jordan	Perry! I didn't freak out 'cause you and I are two very independent people in a relationship and we don't always share our feelings. I didn't get angry because I'm not surprised.
21519	Jack	Ba-ba.
21520	Jordan	Let's go ballet!Do I wish it were different? Sometimes. But, whatever you and I have is working, so I guess I just have to live with it.
21521	Doctor	So, how you feeling down there?
21522	Dr. Cox	Oh, great. Great. Reverse it.
21523	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21524	Billy	See ya, lads.
21525	Turk	Ohh, man!
21526	J.D.	I know we feel guilty, okay? But it's over. It's not like there's gonna be any ramifications.
21527	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21528	Nurse Roberts	You have one day to come up with another gorgeous Irishman.
21529	Todd	One day.What? The Todd appreciates hot, regardless of gender!
21530	Elliot	I'm glad Billy's gone. He's such a jerk. He kept calling me "bonny."
21531	Carla	"Bonny" means "pretty."
21532	Elliot	Oh, my God! I will never love like that again!
21533	Carla	You know I wasn't really mad about Billy or the whole flaking thing. I remember hugging you the day of my wedding and thinking to myself, even though the other two bridesmaids were my sisters, I felt closer to you.
21534	Elliot	When did we stop being best friends? I mean, it feels like it took us so long to get to that point and that it's gone away so quickly, you know?
21535	Carla	Well, my fault. Been burying myself in being married.
21536	Elliot	Oh, please, it was your first year. I mean, I should've been the one to make the extra effort.
21537	Carla	So what now?
21538	Elliot	We try harder.
21539	Carla	All right.
21540	Elliot	When you grow up in an orchard, you don't have much choice.Apple thieves.
21541	Carla	Ahhh.
21542	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21543	Jordan	What the hell happened to you?
21544	Dr. Cox	I got them to reverse the vasectomy.
21545	Jordan	What an incredibly normal thing to do!
21546	Dr. Cox	Jordan, let me talk for a second. I've been trained for many years to take any emotion I feel, push it down, and then let it out by drinking way too much and by yelling at the football players on my T.V. screen. And I...I really thought I hit the jackpot when I finally met a woman who was as disturbed and closed-off as I am.
21547	Jordan	Thank you.
21548	Dr. Cox	You're welcome. Still, now I want more. I I really do. I want to talk about things. Not not everything. Not everything. I definitely, definitely don't want to talk about everything. For instance I don't need to know when you beat up a woman in the park because her purse is the same color as yours; but things that matter, things that are important to us as a as a family. And I know...I know that there are guys who bring flowers and that there are guys who write love songs. But, Jordan, I'm a guy sitting in front of you here with a twice operated-on penis that says "I want to be a couple that communicates more openly."
21549	Jordan	What kind of guy writes love songs?
21550	Dr. Cox	Guys whose mothers make them go to ballet class.
21551	Jordan	Fair enough.
21552	Dr. Cox	I love you too.
21553	Jordan	Okay, now that we're being all open and honest?
21554	Dr. Cox	Yeah.
21555	Jordan	I do not want to have any more kids. I think you should get the vasectomy!
21556	Dr. Cox	Fantastic.
21557	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21558	J.D.'s Narration	My partner and I yeah, I said it we had heard that Billy was back, and he was mad.
21559	Billy	I warned ya!
21560	J.D.	What the hell happened?
21561	Billy	He woke up and said something snarky, so I popped him again!
21562	Turk	Are you serious?!
21563	Guy	BOO!
21564	J.D.	Aaaaaaaghgggghhhhhhh!Ohh, you think scaring people's funny, huh?! Well, good! Because you're dying!
21565	Turk	John Dorian, you are a doctor!
21566	J.D.	Well, he started it!
21567	Billy	Sorry about your face, man.
21568	Guy	Oh, please, I threw the first punch. It was my fault.
21569	Billy	Right then. I'm off.I'm supposed to be in Florence by midnight.
21570	Turk	How the hell are you gonna do that?
21571	Billy	Her apartment's two blocks away. It should be no problem at all.
21572	J.D.	Well, hey, we're sorry about the whole incarceration thing.
21573	Billy	No worries. Life's too short to hold a grudge. But still, you two boys might want to ask yourselves why you contacted the authorities but didn't have the decency to come and talk to me first. But I should let you two "partners" figure that out. By the way, you're a gorgeous couple. Good luck to ya.See ya, lads!
21574	Jerry	When I was alive, I wish I had lived one day like he lives every day of his life.
21575	J.D.	Dead people don't talk, Jerry.
21576	J.D.'s Narration	We weren't really mad at Jerry, what we realized was that we were jealous of Billy, because he was out living life and Turk and I weren't.Whether it's appreciating your relationships...
21577	Dr. Cox	All righty, let's go for the hat-trick, there, doc.
21578	Doctor	Are you sure?
21579	Jordan	Hey, doc! Zip it, grip it, and snip it!
21580	J.D.'s Narration	Or renewing your friendships.
21581	Carla	I almost peed!
21582	J.D.'s Narration	For Turk and I, it was important just to get out and start living life, period.
21583	Turk	Buddy, it is almost one o'clock in the morning, and we have to be at work at five.
21584	J.D.	I know, but how often do we do this?
21585	Turk	You're absolutely right, come on.Do you have any twos?
21586	J.D.	Uh, no. Go fish, please.Do you have any Ks?
21587	Turk	Ah, please go fish.

21589	J.D.'s Narration	Even though it can be tough around here, sometimes God gives you little gifts to get you through the day.
21590	Dr. Cox	You're gonna wanna grab a mop
21591	Janitor	Shush. Watching 'The Sixth Sense'.
21592	Dr. Cox	There's a mess in the hallway.
21593	Janitor	This kid sees dead people.
21594	Dr. Cox	That film is at least five years old.
21595	Janitor	So what? I haven't seen it.
21596	Dr. Cox	Bruce Willis is a ghost. He's been dead the entire time. All the best.
21597	Janitor	Noooo! NO!
21598	J.D.	You guys, I am so excited about tonight.
21599	Carla	Settle down, we're just going to a nightclub.
21600	J.D.	No, Carla, an African-American club.
21601	Turk	Promise me you'll be cool.
21602	J.D.'s Narration	In Turk's defense, we had tried this once before.
21603	J.D.	You can't touch me.
21604	J.D.'s Narration	And once before that.
21605	J.D.	Yeeeeeaaaaah, booooooy!Man, it's only ten o'clock.
21606	J.D.'s Narration	But, hey, third time's the charm.
21607	Bouncer	All right, you three can go in.
21608	J.D.	Word.
21609	Bouncer	Ah! You're out.
21610	Carla	Oh, look, sir, please, just
21611	Turk	Baby, I got this. Don't worry about this. Listen here, man, homey here, you know, he's a little outta his mizzle, so I'm just saying, for just a little bizzle, if you let him up in this pizzle, he'll be all chizzle!

21616	Carla	Just don't lose your head, Bambi!Turk! J.D.'s doing theHeh. Oh, God.
21617	J.D.'s Narration	After two hours of intense roboting, I was parched.
21618	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21619	Narration	And that's when I saw Kylie.
21620	J.D.	Uh, can you make me an appletini?
21621	Kylie	I hope so, it's my favorite drink.
21622	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh my God, that's a sign. If only she had my goofy sense of humor.
21623	Kylie	Ran out of vodka. Let me go downstairs and get some more.I been working on my fake stair walk.
21624	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, time to move in for the kill. Work the fact that you're a doctor into the conversation. Just be subtle.
21625	J.D.	I'm a doctor. Uh, John Dorian. Most of my patients live.
21626	Kylie	This is so weird! I been looking for a doctor! See...
21627	J.D.'s Thoughts	My God, look at those beautiful eyes. They're so big I can see myself in them. Wow, how cute am I!
21628	Kylie	...so it's probably nothing big, but I'm wondering if you could check it out?
21629	J.D.	You got it! Come by Sacred Heart tomorrow, I have clinic hours. After all, I'm a doctor.
21630	Turk	Dude, I can't believe this. You're gonna date a patient! I hope she has something that keeps her here for a while so you can get to know her.
21631	J.D.	I gotta thank you for taking a special interest in this.
21632	Carla	Don't give him too much credit. He's just excited because he wishes he dated more sexy black women when he was single.
21633	Todd	Well, at least he married one.
21634	Carla	Todd, I'm not black.
21635	Todd	Right, and I'm not straight.
21636	J.D.	Do you ever get that special fluttery feeling in your heart when you feel like a woman is about to change your life?

21638	Kylie	Hey! J.D.! This is my boyfriend James. Thanks again for seeing him.
21639	Turk	How's your heart?

21641	Todd	There! Is she black?
21642	Doc	Nuh-uh.
21643	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21644	J.D.	Be with you in a second.
21645	James	Thanks, doc!
21646	J.D.	It's funny, I thought you said you were the one who needed a doctor.
21647	Kylie	No, I told you it was James.
21648	J.D.	Ohh. How could I not have heard that?
21649	Kylie	Remember, I said...
21650	J.D.'s Thoughts	My God, look at those beautiful eyes. They're so bi You're doing it again!
21651	Kylie	...so, I'll see you in there.
21652	J.D.	Okay. In there, I'll see you.Oh man, I can't believe it's over.
21653	Turk	Dude, maybe it's not that serious, all right? There could be a window. But you have to get in there and fish for information, all right? You don't want to lose this hottie! She is a slammin' hottie! And you don't wann
21654	Carla	Turk.
21655	Turk	Mm-hmm.
21656	J.D.	I got this: Baby, you know you're his world!
21657	Turk	Dude? A guy walks into a dentist's office and says, "I think I'm a moth." The dentist then says, "Well, if you think you're a moth, why'd you come to the dentist's office?" The guy then says, "Well, the light was on."
21658	J.D.	That moth is crazy!Hey, I heard a great joke. A guy walks into a dentist's office and says, "I think I'm a moth." And the dentist says, "Well, if you think you're a moth, why are you at a dentist's office?"
21659	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, no, I forgot the punchline.... You can't bail out now! Stall! Stall!
21660	J.D.	...So the moth says..."That's a good question. What kind of dentist are you?" And the dentist says, "Well, I'm a general dentist, but I...I do dabble in orthodontry braces and such." And...and the moth says, "Orthodontry? I hear there's great money in that."
21661	J.D.'s Thoughts	"The light was on"!
21662	J.D.	"But! To answer your original question, which was, if I think I'm a moth, why am I in a dentist's office? The answer is, Because the light was on!"The light! The light, James. Moths love light.
21663	James	I've had a fever and stomach ache for almost a week.
21664	Kylie	Mm.
21665	J.D.	Okay, well, uh, let's get a little history on you.
21666	J.D.'s Thoughts	Time to go fishing for some info.
21667	J.D.	Do you ever have any, uh, shortness of breath? For instance when you're walking Kylie to the apartment that you share?
21668	Kylie	We don't live together.
21669	J.D.'s Thoughts	Window! Window!
21670	J.D.	Oh, so you're you're waiting until you get married?
21671	Kylie	We're not engaged.
21672	James	To answer your question, I don't have any shortness of breath. But my right knee is a little puffy.
21673	J.D.	Well, maybe that's from dragging your feet! Am I right, Kylie! Heh. She knows! Okay.
21674	J.D.'s Narration	Using patient histories to your advantage is an old doctor trick. Let's face it: What a doctor says and what they mean are often two different things.
21675	Elliot	I know Dr. Robbins treated your husband in the E.R., but we're gonna approach this case a bit differently.
21676	Subtitle	Robbins is an idiot.
21677	Mrs. Chang	And it's very comforting to have the chief of medicine here.
21678	Dr. Kelso	I took a special interest in this case.
21679	Subtitle	I was thinking about food, and accidentally wandered over here.
21680	Mrs. Chang	Oh, thank you!
21681	Todd	Hey, Elliot. Your boobies look hot today.
21682	Subtitle	Hey Elliot, your boobies look hot today.
21683	Elliot	Mr. Chang's test results showed that he's in renal failure. We're just waiting for the results of his blood smear.
21684	Dr. Kelso	No need. I saw his chart right before I went to the bakery. He's got malaria.
21685	Elliot	And you were going to tell him this after you had a sticky bun?
21686	Dr. Kelso	Well, in my defense, he's going to live at least another twelve hours and the bakery closes at five.
21687	Elliot	Well, we've gotta get moving on this! What should we do?
21688	Dr. Kelso	Nothing. Mr. Chang is not long for this world.
21689	Elliot	Do you believe that guy?
21690	Dr. Cox	I never cease to be amazed by the depth of his cynicism and callousness.
21691	Elliot	So, what do you think we should do?
21692	Dr. Cox	Oh, I don't care. I'm going home to watch the Lakers play the Heat. It's the game of the year Shaq versus Kobe. And you are going to stay here and deal with this yourself.
21693	Elliot	Shaq versus Kobe?
21694	Dr. Cox	All the best. Ooh! Let it happen! Three, two, one! Ahhhhhh!
21695	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21696	J.D.	What's this stretch good for?
21697	Turk	It loosens up my chest. But you should probably stretch too.
21698	J.D.	Don't need to, buddy I got a tube of Ben-Gay on each one of my hamstrings.
21699	Turk	How things going with Kylie?
21700	J.D.	They're okay. Is there some special way to get a black girl to like you?
21701	Turk	Dude, the only difference between a black girl and a white girl is that when a black girl asks you if her ass looks big?
21702	J.D.	Uh-huh?
21703	Turk	You say, "Hell yeah!"
21704	J.D.	All right!
21705	Turk	Okay! You wanna play some ball?
21706	J.D.	Hell, yes!
21707	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21708	Elliot	Dr. Kelso, I have thought about it, and I am not going to just stand around and wait for Mr. Chang to die.
21709	Dr. Kelso	Excuse me?
21710	Dr. Cox	Are you kidding me? Barbie going toe-to-toe with Big Bob in a battle of the annoyings? Well, happy birthday to me!
21711	Elliot	We should do an exchange transfusion.
21712	Dr. Cox	And the southpaw with the blonde bangs and the big britches comes out sa-winging!
21713	Dr. Kelso	Sweetheart, the man is seventy-two and in multisystem organ dysfunction. It's done! It's parasites one, person zero! And if you tell that family he's got a chance, all you're doing is raising their hopes.
21714	Dr. Cox	Ohhh! Tremendous body blow!
21715	Dr. Kelso	Oh, and for the record, we're not colleagues. I don't care what you think.
21716	Dr. Cox	Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! And the fight goes to the stocky middleweight from Monroeville, Pennsylvania!
21717	Dr. Kelso	By the way, Perry, Mickhead called in sick. I need you to work tonight.
21718	Dr. Cox	Well, yeah, that's well and good, but I'm not available.There is no chance I am missing this game! No chance, no how!What the...? Say, Bob, what the hell happened in your office?
21719	Dr. Kelso	Oh, every year the med students get me with a practical joke. They messed with the speed control on my treadmill.What I can't figure is how they got into my office.
21720	Ted	Here's the key to Kelso's office.
21721	Dr. Cox	And here's Nurse Tisdale's phone number.I don't have any idea how they might have gotten in here, Bob. But I can tell you this: If you think I'm missing the biggest game of the year, you got another thing
21722	Dr. Kelso	I hate to interrupt you, but I'm still feeling a little woozy from being shot into my wall like a lawn dart. So why don't you just go work your shift and use my VCR to tape the game?
21723	Dr. Cox	When did you get this?
21724	Dr. Kelso	Right about the time we couldn't afford that M.R.I. machine.
21725	Dr. Cox	Ah, of course you did.

21730	J.D.	You
21731	Kylie	What happened to your eye?

21733	Turk	Embarrassing for me, actually, see....
21734	J.D.	Yeah. I ally-ooped him.
21735	Turk	Shut up.
21736	Kylie	Mmm! You coulda used J.D. at Seton Hall!
21737	Turk	Oh, also, the soup kitchen where you volunteer called, and they said You played ball at Seton Hall?
21738	James	All four years.
21739	Turk	Get outta here!
21740	J.D.	Did-did-did the soup kitchen where I volunteer have a message?
21741	Turk	Yeah, they're out of broth. So what was like playing college ball?
21742	James	Oh, man, it's bett
21743	Kylie	Sweetie, I'm gonna go to the cafeteria and get you a coffee.
21744	James	Oh, okay.

21746	J.D.	Thank you. Your test results, let's see what's going on.
21747	James	Oh, no, we haven't slept together...yet. It's not like I'm missing out shoot, I probably got it from my secretary. Or that trainer from the gym. Ooh, or this fine chick, Tamyra, that bartends with Kylie? Yeah.

21750	Dr. Cox	Listen up. I have been cursed to work the night shift with you chuckleheads, which means I have to tape the Laker-Heat game. And seeing as no one in the history of this germ box has ever made it through a shift without saying "Oh my God, oh, my God, did you see what happened last night on America's Fattest Fatties? A 900 pound woman lost a pound and a half and cried for twenty minutes!" Be warned: If you utter a word about the score of the game, it will be your last. Now get out! Go, go, go, go, go. Chop chop!
21751	J.D.'s Narration	What drives people to seek revenge?
21752	Janitor	So.... You don't want to know the ending of something? I can relate to that.
21753	Dr. Cox	What is that in your lap?
21754	Janitor	Leonard! Half kitten, half monkey!
21755	Dr. Kelso	Unfortunately, with his system failing, Dr. Reid and I have agreed there's nothing more we can do.
21756	J.D.'s Narration	What drives people to go back on their word?
21757	Elliot	If we do an exchange transfusion there's a chance we can save your father.
21758	Mrs. Chang	Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you!
21759	James	Now, you have to keep this between us you know, doctor-patient confidentiality, right?
21760	J.D.'s Narration	And what do you do when every fiber of your being wants to say something, but you know you can't?

21766	Turk	Baby, you did not just compare cheating and getting gonorrhea to me using your soap
21767	Carla	I'm just saying men let you down. J.D., you have to tell her.
21768	Turk	Baby, when J.D. became a doctor, he took the Hippocratic Oath. And I'm sorry, but there's no way around it.
21769	Kylie	Is...there an "A"?
21770	J.D.	Yes there is!
21771	Kylie	Yes!
21772	J.D.	There may be a way around it....
21773	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21774	Elliot	Thanks.
21775	Dr. Cox	Ooh, Bar-bye! You are up there without a net this time! Well, I sure do hope Mr. Chang rallies for ya, because if he doesn't, sure shootin' you're gonna be hearing Bob Kelso's voice saying "sweetheart, I told you so" from now until you are two inches shorter and driving around Florida with your left-hand blinker on.
21776	Janitor	Oh, now it's time to ruin the game! Come with me to the window!
21777	Dr. Cox	Why? What do you have, some elaborate plan?
21778	Janitor	I do, as a matter of fact. I convinced everybody in this hospital that's afraid of me to go outside and spell out the score of the game.
21779	Dr. Cox	Really?
21780	Janitor	No, you idiot. I'm just gonna tell you the score of the game...maybe knock your head against the glass.
21781	Dr. Cox	Look. I was way outta line telling you how that movie ended. But, God save me, watching sports is one of the last pure pleasures I have left in my life. So you, you tell me, what's it gonna take for you to let me go home, sit in my massage chair, and enjoy the game?
21782	Janitor	I would like...to perform open-heart surgery.
21783	Dr. Cox	No.
21784	Janitor	How about you perform surgery on me so that I can breathe under water.
21785	Dr. Cox	No.
21786	Janitor	I would like a shark that can read minds.
21787	Dr. Cox	No!
21788	Janitor	You and I trade lives for a year.
21789	Dr. Cox	No!
21790	Janitor	How about a home-cooked meal and an hour in your massage chair?
21791	Dr. Cox	Done.
21792	Janitor	Done!Hey, guys! It's off!Wow! You guys are organized!
21793	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21794	Ted	Hey! Catch that Lakers-Heat game? Five seconds left!
21795	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21796	J.D.	I can't believe you make three hundred dollars in tips a night.
21797	Kylie	Mm-hmm. This is why doctors should have tip jars. I mean, I make three bucks for serving a martini, you put your lips on the mouth of a slobbering dead guy and bring him back to life that's gotta be worth at least a five spot!I...should be getting back to James.
21798	J.D.	There's no rush. Uh, a nurse is up there right now getting some blood from him.
21799	James	Oh!
21800	Carla	I'm sorry! It's never taken me twelve pokes to find a vein!
21801	James	Ow!
21802	Carla	Got it! Wheeeee!
21803	Kylie	Ugh, I shoulda brought my laptop I could've gotten so much work done.
21804	J.D.	You can bartend online?
21805	Kylie	I just work at the club to pay for grad school.
21806	J.D.	Mm.
21807	Kylie	I'm getting my Masters in political science.
21808	J.D.	I love politics! Ask me anything!
21809	J.D.'s Thoughts	What are you doing?! You don't know anything about politics! You're screwed unless she asks about Bush or the bald assistant president who has all those heart attacks!
21810	Kylie	Did you know only seventeen percent of people under the age of twenty-five voted last year?
21811	J.D.	You can vote if you're under twenty-five?
21812	J.D.'s Thoughts	The only thing you can take solace in is that a girl like her would probably never be interested in you anyway.
21813	Kylie	I can't believe a cute guy like you doesn't have a girlfriend. If I was single, I'd totally snatch you up.
21814	J.D.	Would you like to play a game of Hangman?
21815	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21816	J.D.'s Narration	As I sat there letting my interns do all my work, I wondered if there was a parallel universe where another J.D. and another Kylie could be together because there's no Hippocratic Oath on planet Glornak Seven.
21817	Elliot	Are you on Glornak Seven?
21818	J.D.	Why are you so happy?
21819	Elliot	I just did an exchange transfusion on my malaria patient in there, and he just woke up on from his coma.
21820	J.D.	Well, he woke up to a world of bad boyfriends, oaths, and gonorrhea.
21821	Elliot	He sure did. And you know why? Because I broke the rules and ignored what Dr. Kelso wanted me to do.
21822	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes you have to break the rules. And Elliot's patient waking up was a clear sign that you couldn't deny.
21823	Nurse Tisdale	Mr. Chang is crashing!
21824	J.D.'s Thoughts	Signs be damned! I'm telling her!
21825	J.D.	Kylie! Kylie!
21826	Turk	Dude! You can't tell her! They won't let you be a doctor anymore!
21827	J.D.	Who cares! I'd make more money bartending!
21828	Carla	Turk! If we leave right now, I might actually be awake for sex tonight. Just go get my coat.You owe me.
21829	Turk	Baby! So, I didn't know which one was yours, so I grabbed all of 'em.
21830	Carla	Just give me a second, okay? I need to talk to Elliot, and then I gotta clock out.
21831	Turk	And then we have sex? Then we have...?
21832	Elliot	I really thought he had a shot.
21833	Carla	Well, the family's downstairs whenever you're ready to talk to them.
21834	Elliot	Go ahead. Call me sweetheart and tell me I'm a pathetic excuse for a doctor.
21835	Dr. Kelso	You made a bold decision and it bit you in the keister.
21836	Elliot	Yeah.
21837	Dr. Kelso	I don't like people disagreeing with me. There's not another resident here who has the guts to do it.
21838	Elliot	I just feel so guilty about Mr. Chang. Could you at least just...make fun of my bangs or something?
21839	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Reid, take it from a colleague. Telling that family what happened after getting their hopes up is going to be far worse than any shot I could take at that John Denver haircut you're sporting.
21840	Elliot	Did...did you just call me a colleague?
21841	Dr. Kelso	I did. But I hate my colleagues.What the hell are you doing?
21842	Turk	I get to have sex!
21843	Dr. Kelso	I hate this place.
21844	Turk	I get to have sex tonight!
21845	J.D.	Hey, Kylie, there you are.
21846	Kylie	Hey! J.D.!
21847	J.D.'s Thoughts	This is your moment! Grab it!
21848	Kylie	I wanted to thank you for being such a great doctor.
21849	J.D.'s Narration	And there it was. Great doctors don't break oaths.
21850	Kylie	Thanks again. For everything.
21851	J.D.'s Narration	Someone once said the bad guys always win. Sometimes the bad guy is a jerk boyfriend.
21852	Sports Announcer	It's finally here! The long-awaited showdown between Shaq and Kobe!
21853	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes the bad guy is the man you've been battling with for as long as you can remember.
21854	Dr. Kelso	Hey, Perry! 98-97, Lakers. Kobe dunked over Shaq for the game winner. Don't ever mess with my treadmill!
21855	Janitor	Is this homemade gravy? Mmm!
21856	J.D.'s Narration	And sometimes the bad guy is a disease that you didn't stand a chance against.
21857	Mrs. Chang	But...you said he could get better.
21858	Elliot	I am so sorry.
21859	J.D.'s Narration	I guess all you can do is come back to work the next morning and hope that being a good guy pays off.
21860	J.D.	What are you doing here?
21861	Kylie	My girlfriend Tamyra, from the club? She's also feeling a little sick, and you'll never guess what she has.
21862	J.D.	Gonorrhea! I mean...gonorrhea.
21863	Kylie	You could tell me now.
21864	J.D.	Your boyfriend is a jerk.
21865	Kylie	He's not my boyfriend.
21866	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21867	J.D.'s Narration	Before I settled on the outfit for my first date with Kylie, I had to run it by the experts.
21868	J.D.	So be honest, but not too honest, okay, 'cause I'm feeling a little chunky.
21869	Carla	We like it.
21870	J.D.	Oh, thank god. I-I-I could have sworn I heard the word jowly.
21871	Elliot	So, uh...heh. How many outfits did you try on before you picked that one?
21872	J.D.	Not too many.
21873	Carla	You know, on a first date, I could see what a guy was wearing and know exactly how far he was gonna get that night.
21874	Elliot	Oh, me, too.
21875	Carla	Yeah, he is.
21876	Elliot	Whoa! That guy's gettin' a hug at the door. Heh.
21877	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21878	Elliot	And that guy is getting a fake name and a phone number with six digits.
21879	J.D.	I know how ridiculous this looks.
21880	Carla	I don't think you do.
21881	J.D.	But the entire ensemble works together, and the jacket never comes off.
21882	Carla	The top won't go up.
21883	J.D.	It'll be awesome.Sorry about your hair.
21884	Kylie	Don't beat yourself up. I got a scrunchie.There!
21885	J.D.	What the hell was that?
21886	Kylie	It's a poor little possum! We should take him to the vet!
21887	J.D.'s Narration	It was Sophie's Choice. Either heartlessly leave the possum there to die or wrap that little guy up in my sports coat and reveal the short-sleeved nerd jersey that lurked beneath.
21888	J.D.	Careful. His, uh, little hoof is bleeding on the gear shift.
21889	Kylie	Oh. Sorry.
21890	Vet	Yeah, this thing's dead. That'll be a hundred-twenty dollars.
21891	J.D.'s Thoughts	A hundred and twenty dollars for a stupid dead rat!?
21892	Kylie	I think it's so sweet that you're depressed about that poor little possum.
21893	J.D.	I'll always remember him. Little Carlton.Anyway, we only lost about a half hour. We can still make that reservation!Oh, there's possums everywhere!
21894	Kylie	No, no no no. It's just a box.A...talking box.I think your shirt stopped the bleeding.
21895	J.D.	Great!
21896	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21897	Carla	Happy birthday, Laverne!
21898	Nurse Roberts	Thanks, Carla.
21899	Turk	Did your brother make you face cake?
21900	Nurse Roberts	Sure did!
21901	Carla	Wow.
21902	Turk	Think I could have a piece of that face cake?
21903	Elliot	I heard there's face cake!
21904	Nurse Roberts	Back off!
21905	Turk	Outstanding.
21906	J.D.	Nurse? Do me a favor, please bandage this gentleman up, little bit...fix him up.
21907	J.D.'s Narration	I think they sensed that my first date wasn't going perfectly; and even though I could smell face cake in the air, it was about to get worse.
21908	Danni	Dr. Dorkian, I presume?
21909	J.D.'s Thoughts	The ex-girlfriend from hell.
21910	J.D.	Danni, love to stay and talk, but I'm giving Kylie here a tour of the I.C.U.
21911	Bum	Hey. Hey, hey! You were gonna take me back to the underpass!
21912	J.D.	After the tour! What is it with you and the underpass?
21913	Dr. Cox	She's your nightmare sister. You take her out to dinner.
21914	Jordan	I spent the whole day with her. She stole a sweater!
21915	Danni	So what? You're the one wearing it.
21916	J.D.	Thanks for the shirt, Lonnie.
21917	Lonnie	Are you doing this because I forgot to shave this morning?
21918	J.D.'s Thoughts	Good lord! That's a one-day mustache?
21919	J.D.	No, Lonnie.It's so great, because the residents are practically our slaves.
21920	J.D.'s Thoughts	Aggghhh! I just said "slaves" to my new black girlfriend!
21921	Kylie	Unfreeze, J.D. It's over.
21922	J.D.	Well, let's see. "Fatigue, fever, malaise." Have you been to Hong Kong, sir?
21923	Patient	Yeah...?
21924	J.D.'s Narration	And then I said something stupid.
21925	J.D.	Could be SARS.
21926	J.D.'s Narration	I forgot that if any doctor suspects SARS, it's cause for immediate quarantine lockdown.
21927	Dr. Cox	What have you done, Newbie?
21928	Danni	Quarantinis, anyone?
21929	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21930	Dr. Kelso	Mr. Donaldson hasn't been to Hong Kong in twenty years, so I bet my one remaining testicle no one has SARS.
21931	J.D.	Kylie, angry mob. Angry mob, Kylie.
21932	Danni	SARS sucks.
21933	Dr. Cox	Okay. You can direct any technical questions to my former sister-in-law.
21934	Danni	Hi.
21935	Doug	Hi.
21936	Dr. Cox	Otherwise, let's bear in mind that we are short-handed there are only four doctors here.
21937	Turk	I counted more than that.
21938	Dr. Cox	I'm talking legitimate doctors, turtle head.
21939	Todd	There's only two of us.
21940	Dr. Cox	You are so very useless, I counted you both twice.
21941	Todd	Yeah you did!
21942	J.D.	So be honest is this the worst first date you've ever been on or what?
21943	Kylie	I don't know. I think it's kind of exciting...being in a hospital, getting to see you in action. I just wish I could be your assistant.
21944	J.D.	Say no more. Lonnie, shirt!
21945	Lonnie	No!
21946	J.D.	Don't make me say pants. I'll do it.Still tanning, I see.
21947	Kylie	He's your bitch, isn't he?
21948	J.D.	Yeah.
21949	Kylie	That is so cute! I'll go change.
21950	Elliot	So, Kylie looks like she's having fun.
21951	J.D.	It's a front. She's miserable. So far the highlight of the night's been putting the possum to sleep and that's not a euphemism.
21952	Elliot	J.D., seeing a young doctor do his job is an amazing turn-on for a girl.
21953	Kylie	So what first, doctor?
21954	J.D.	Well, you need a chart.
21955	Kylie	Lonnie! Chart!
21956	J.D.	You look ridiculous.
21957	J.D.'s Thoughts	Except for that glorious mustache.
21958	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21959	Danni	Hey, grouchy pants! Do you wanna hang out?
21960	Dr. Cox	Does "hang out" mean choke you?
21961	Ted	Hey, Danni, what's shakin'?Turk and Carla's wedding we made out?
21962	Doug	So did we.
21963	Danni	Was it at the same time? Because I have a habit of doing that at people's weddings.
21964	Dr. Cox	Leaving. Good show, fellas.
21965	Danni	Wait for me, Perr-Perr!
21966	Doug	Smooth maneuver, hoover. You scared her off.
21967	Ted	You were the one who was embarrassingly forward!
21968	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21969	Turk	I'm bored. I'm a surgeon, and there's no surgery.
21970	Carla	Why do you think I brought you in here? We're short-handed. Mr. Dempsey needs his bedsores redressed.
21971	Turk	Baby, that's a nurse stuff, I don't have the expertise.
21972	Carla	Turk, any idiot can be a nurse.
21973	Turk	I know, I just think
21974	Carla	I knew you thought that! I knew it.
21975	Turk	You tricked me!
21976	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21977	Ted	Say she's mine, Murphy!
21978	Doug	Not until you kill me! Aiiee!
21979	Dr. Kelso	The only thing I detest more than treating patients is treating patients on an empty stomach. I'm famished!
21980	Janitor	We've been in here for eight minutes.
21981	Dr. Kelso	I haven't eaten since yesterday.
21982	Janitor	That's an incredibly boring story, with a fantastic......FINISH!
21983	Dr. Kelso	Five bucks says you can't do that twice.
21984	Janitor	You're on.Double or nothin'.
21985	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21986	Elliot	So how's it going with Kylie?
21987	J.D.	There was nothing exciting going on....
21988	Bum	Got twenty bucks?
21989	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21990	Dr. Cox	So, Nurse Ghandirella, I need you to suction this guy, do a wet-to-dry dressing change, and, oh, what the hell, go ahead and top him off with one of your special, special sponge baths happy ending optional, his choice, not yours.
21991	Turk	This guy's in a coma.
21992	Dr. Cox	Not all of him.Not here, not here, not here, not here, not here, not here
21993	Turk	Danni!
21994	Dr. Cox	not he-he-re!
21995	Danni	Hi!
21996	Dr. Cox	Oh, good! You're here!
21997	Danni	Yeah, sure. I'd love to.Hey, didn't I go to your wedding?
21998	Turk	Yeah. You threw up on my gram-gram.Hey! You can't get inside my head! Hey, mentally? Strong!You can't smoke in here.
21999	Danni	I don't see any signs.
22000	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22001	Dr. Kelso	So how much does he owe me, Barbarino?
22002	Todd	Six hundred so far.
22003	Janitor	Dammit, man, you cannot afford this. Stop...stop...stop...!
22004	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22005	J.D.	Come on, Steve! Stay with me, buddy!
22006	Bum	I want more money.
22007	J.D.	WHAT!?
22008	Bum	Fifty bucks or I tell the girl.
22009	J.D.	I don't have it!
22010	Bum	Get it!
22011	J.D.	Elliot, I need another doctor over here, stat!
22012	Elliot	Yeah?
22013	J.D.	Gimme thirty dollars.
22014	Elliot	I gave you twenty, I'm tapped!
22015	J.D.	I need a dermatologist over here, stat!
22016	Dr. Johnson	Oh yeah! Time to shine!
22017	J.D.	Look, I paid this guy to fake a heart attack. He wants fifty bucks, we only have twenty.
22018	Dr. Johnson	You know, I feel like you guys just use me for my money.
22019	J.D.	You have a trust fund! Now gimme the money!
22020	Dr. Johnson	Ehhh!
22021	J.D.	CLEAR!
22022	Bum	I'm alive!
22023	J.D.	J.D., one Lord, zero.
22024	J.D.'s Narration	Just like that, love was in the air. It was as if our first date got other people talking about some of theirs.
22025	Elliot	I had this one first date where the guy took me to play paintball. All he does the whole time is shoot me in the face. After two years with that guy, I'm like, "That's enough!" You know?
22026	Janitor	Ha ha! First dates, huh?
22027	Todd	I went out with this girl, she was like the worst first date ever. I take her for a romantic ferry ride, and for some reason I decide to take it out
22028	Carla	Okay. Your turn is done.
22029	Turk	Yeah...you know what? Really don't wanna hear about this one. Okay!
22030	Dr. Cox	...And she didn't like the pizza I ordered because it had anchovies on it. You believe that?
22031	Carla	It had anchovies.
22032	Dr. Cox	And pineapples.
22033	Carla	And pineapples?
22034	Dr. Cox	And red peppers.
22035	Carla	And green peppers.
22036	Turk	Ohhh.
22037	Carla	Wait red peppers!
22038	Turk	NOOOOOOOOOOOO!
22039	J.D.'s Narration	I could hear the pain in my best friend's voice, and I could feel how little I cared...because by the way Kylie was looking at me, I knew she thought I was sexy.
22040	Kylie	You know something? Seeing you in your element today, you seem so...
22041	J.D.'s Thoughts	Here it comes sexy!
22042	Kylie	Genuine.
22043	J.D.'s Thoughts	She would have said sexy if I had a mustache.
22044	Kylie	You know, James lied all the time, and I don't know...it's just nice to be with a guy I can trust.
22045	J.D.	Cool.
22046	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, no.
22047	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22048	J.D.	I don't deserve this....
22049	Elliot	So, you just tell her the truth, she's mad at you for a little while, and then she forgives ya.
22050	J.D.	I see what you're saying! There's no downside! Kylie!
22051	Turk	You dated the devil.
22052	Carla	Turk.
22053	Turk	And you lied to me.
22054	Carla	No, uh-uh! No. You never asked me if I dated Dr. Cox. You can ask me anything, I would never lie to you.
22055	Turk	Do you sometimes wish I had hair?
22056	Carla	Yes.
22057	Turk	This is a nightmare. I'm standing here living in a nightmare.
22058	Carla	Okay, maybe I'm guilty of a lie of omission.
22059	Turk	'Cause you're a lie omitter!
22060	Carla	I know this may be asking too much, but could you please try and keep it together until we can get home and talk about it?
22061	Turk	Fine.
22062	Carla	Thank you.
22063	Lonnie	Carla, I like your hair that way.
22064	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22065	Dr. Kelso	Laverne, I bet you're tempted to break open that face cake and just tear it apart.
22066	Nurse Roberts	No one's touching this.
22067	Dr. Kelso	Oh, I don't care. I'm not even hungry.
22068	Janitor	Dr. Kelso, I don't have seven hundred dollars....That actually sounded like the word "cake."
22069	Dr. Kelso	You get me that damn face cake, and you are free and clear.
22070	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22071	Danni	Hi, Glenn.
22072	Doug	I'm Glenn.
22073	Ted	I'm Glenn!Look, let's not go down that road again. Come on. Shake.
22074	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22075	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, it's time to come clean.
22076	J.D.	Kylie, I brought you here because I wanted to tell you
22077	Doug	Say I'm Glenn!
22078	J.D.	...That's peculiar...
22079	Danni	J.D.! J.D.! Look at me!
22080	Kylie	Ugh! That's exactly the kind of girl my ex-boyfriend would have dated.
22081	J.D.	I barely know her.
22082	J.D.'s Thoughts	And the lies begin again.
22083	J.D.	I certainly would never sleep with her.
22084	J.D.'s Thoughts	That's it you're stronger than this. Not another lie!
22085	J.D.	I race motorcycles.Excuse me.What the hell are you doing?
22086	Bum	I need more cash.
22087	J.D.	For what?
22088	Bum	I'm puttin' DSL in my box.
22089	J.D.	Fine! But know this: you've been nothing but a disappointment to me since the moment I ran over you.
22090	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22091	Dr. Cox	Hey, baby.
22092	Carla	Keep it together.
22093	Dr. Cox	Do you remember that quarantine we had seven years ago? It was just you and me, all alone late at night here in the I.C.U.?
22094	Turk	That's it.
22095	Carla	Turk!
22096	Dr. Cox	Come on. If he wasn't such a jealous baby, it wouldn't be such a big deal.
22097	Carla	Give him a break! What if you found out Jordan had a history with somebody here?
22098	Dr. Cox	Oh, fair enough.In the brief eighteen months that Jordan and I weren't together, how many of you had your way with her?Bear in mind, I'm gonna need absolute honesty here or I will brain you.Anyway, whoever taught Jordan that reverse cowgirl position...it's long overdue, but thank you.
22099	Dr. Mickhead	You're welcome.
22100	Carla	You're a freak.
22101	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22102	Nurse Roberts	Who ate my face cake?!
22103	Dr. Kelso	He did.
22104	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22105	Elliot	Wow, he is really out.
22106	J.D.	A mild sedative fell into his juice box.
22107	Elliot	Look, J.D...I know why you're lying about everything. You don't think you're good enough for Kylie. I mean, you've always had this insecure thing even though you're this funny, weird, amazing guy. I mean...that's why I fell in love with you, and I'm betting if you just act like yourself, Kylie will too.
22108	J.D.	Thanks, Elliot. Really.
22109	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22110	Elliot	No, it's not.
22111	J.D.	What do you call that bra you wore for your date last week?
22112	Elliot	Oh, the Miracle Lift Super Push-Up bra?
22113	J.D.	Carla, when you first started dating Turk, didn't you tell him you loved watching NBA basketball every weekend?
22114	Carla	Yeah.
22115	J.D.	And how many games have you watched since he proposed?
22116	Carla	One. But only because that time he made me choose between watching basketball or having sex.
22117	Elliot	Ah...heh.
22118	J.D.	Exactly.
22119	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22120	Turk	I don't understand why Carla didn't tell me about you guys.
22121	Dr. Cox	Maybe it's because she's really in love with me, and together we injected you with diabetes to very slowly get you out of the picture.
22122	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22123	J.D.'s Narration	They say all horrible things eventually come to an end.
22124	Dr. Kelso	The lab results are back, and there is no SARS. The quarantine is over. So, bye-bye, everyone.
22125	Nurse Roberts	That looks like my neck!Oh, this does not end well for you.
22126	Dr. Kelso	You are going to pay every cent of that seven hundred dollars!
22127	Janitor	Double or nothin'!We're even. Good night, sir.
22128	J.D.'s Narration	Dr. Kelso made me realize that lies come back to haunt you even little ones about cake.Heck, even a lie of omission shook the foundation of a couple that was much more established than Kylie and me.And I knew I couldn't let her go out that door.
22129	Kylie	Let's go.
22130	J.D.	Kylie, wait.
22131	Kylie	Is there anything else?
22132	Danni	Adios, assface.
22133	J.D.	I had sex with her. A lot.
22134	Kylie	Why are you telling me this?
22135	J.D.	If I don't come clean now, whether it's a few weeks or months or years from now, I know it's gonna come back to haunt me and ruin us, and I don't want that.
22136	Kylie	I'm not looking for a project.
22137	J.D.	Yeah.... I understand. It's....
22138	Kylie	So get it together.
22139	J.D.	Wait. You know, if we if we leave like that, that's how we're always gonna remember this night. I don't want that.
22140	Kylie	So...what do you want to do?
22141	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22142	J.D.'s Narration	Things were amazing with Kylie. But before I could get more emotionally invested, I needed answers to some questions that were very important to me.
22143	J.D.	Name three spin-offs of the sitcom 'Happy Days'.
22144	Kylie	'Mork & Mindy', 'Laverne & Shirley', and 'Joanie Loves Chachi'.
22145	Turk	You marry her. You marry her now! You marry her!
22146	J.D.	Okay, okay, we passed Section One "Sitcoms about or involving Asian-American diner owners." Now on to Section Two "Fat, tubby T.V. husbands and the crazy-hot women that would never actually be married to them."
22147	Carla	Hey, we're missing 'Sanford and Son'!
22148	Turk	What!?
22149	Carla	Yes!
22150	J.D.'s Narration	Turk was freaked out because Carla never joins us on 'Sanford and Son' night. Or 'Cheers' night. I think it was because she was feeling a little romantically competitive with Kylie and me.
22151	Turk	Woman! Woman!
22152	Carla	Hm?
22153	Turk	I am not a lollipop!
22154	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22155	J.D.'s Narration	Carla certainly tried to be as adorable as us...
22156	J.D.	Uh! Darn it! You won!
22157	J.D.'s Narration	...unfortunately, Turk wasn't on the same wavelength.
22158	Turk	AHHH! DO YOU SEE WHAT YOU GET, CARLA!? DO YOU SEE WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU MESS WITH THE WARRIOR!?!
22159	J.D.	YES! Ten to nine!
22160	Kylie	Hi.
22161	J.D.	Hi.
22162	Kylie	Bye.
22163	J.D.	Bye.Ahh. Kylie's in class all day and she bartends at night, and I'm still working sixteen-hour shifts, so we try to make sure we kiss at least once a day. Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, she takes a cab over here; Tuesdays and Thursdays, I scooter to my baby!
22164	Turk	Honey. I haven't foofied in bed in like a week!
22165	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22166	Newscaster	With twenty-seven deaths so far, this strain of E. coli from tainted meat is quite serious. So if you're a big meat-eater, be careful!
22167	J.D.'s Narration	The reason we were upset was that every time the media reports on some weird health crisis, everyone who sees it thinks they have it.
22168	Elliot	Oh, it's not so bad. It's only a few people here.OKAY, OKAY! EVERYBODY JUST SHUT UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP!Ahem. Thank you. Now, who's first?
22169	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, there's always one positive when something like this happens.
22170	J.D.	WOOOOOOOOOO! WOOOOOOOOOHOOHOOHOOOO! I LOVE MEDICINE!
22171	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22172	Elliot	Uh, Dr. Cox! We are having a bit of a crisis here.
22173	Dr. Cox	I see that. It seems you two have worn the same outfit.
22174	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22175	Dr. Cox	Barbie, if it's of any consolation, it looks slightly better on you.
22176	Elliot	No, I'm talking about Thank you.
22177	Dr. Cox	Sure.
22178	J.D.	What the hell are we supposed to do?
22179	Dr. Cox	Loretta, relax, I've been involved in every ridiculous T.V.-induced panic there is. Poison pills, SARS, West Nile, North Face, South Fork, East River, monkeypox, pop rocks, toilet snakes, mad cow, bird flu, swine flu, and, quite frankly, every other flu that you could really only catch if you're actually fornicating with the animal it's named for.
22180	J.D.	I sure hope I don't have dog flu.Well, Mr. Bernstein, do you have vomiting and diarrhea?
22181	Mr. Bernstein	No.
22182	Woman	No.
22183	Man	No.
22184	Woman 2	No.
22185	Man 2	No!
22186	Woman 3	No.
22187	Mr. James	No.
22188	J.D.	Okay, then, Mr. James, you're free Wait a second, Charles James? I was watching the 'Cheers' DVD the other night are you Charles James the writer?
22189	Mr. James	Yeah, that's me.
22190	J.D.'s Thoughts	Just. Stay. Calm.
22191	J.D.	Uh, Elliot, I need to take this gentleman upstairs for some more, uh, tests.
22192	Elliot	J.D., don't leave me here.
22193	J.D.	This is very important! He may even need a surgical consult.
22194	Mr. James	Yeah, I get it.
22195	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22196	Carla	Whoa-ho! What are you doing? No tongue before ten.
22197	Turk	Baby, J.D. and Kylie can make time for that stupid appointment kiss once a day we should be able to do it twice a day!
22198	Carla	Love is not a competition.
22199	Turk	Okay.
22200	Carla	Make it three times.
22201	Turk	All right, bet. See you at noon?
22202	Carla	Noon.
22203	Dr. Kelso	You youngsters. If there is one thing I have learned, it's that you can't schedule love.
22204	Dr. Cox	I think your credit card statement would beg to differ.
22205	Dr. Kelso	Okay, listen up, everyone. For budgetary reasons, we are turning the bathrooms on even-numbered floors into patients rooms. To sum up, floors two and four are no longer for one or two.
22206	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22207	Carla	Well?
22208	Dr. Cox	I'm sorry, would you please repeat the question?
22209	Carla	Are you just gonna roll over like that?
22210	Jordan	That's weird, I asked him the same thing last night.
22211	Carla	Where's the outrage? The anger? The hate?
22212	Jordan	Again, last night!
22213	Carla	You've gone soft.
22214	Jordan	Okay, now it's getting spooky.
22215	Carla	Look, you're the only one who can stand up to Kelso.
22216	Dr. Cox	Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to present Man Not Caring.
22217	Carla	Okay, Jordan, little help.
22218	Jordan	If you don't do what she wants, I'm going to stop having sex with you and start making love...to you.
22219	Dr. Cox	Where is that bastard?! KELSO!
22220	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22221	Turk	My wife's name's Carla.
22222	J.D.	Yeah!
22223	Turk	Yeah! Like Carla from the show.
22224	J.D.	Just like it.
22225	Mr. James	Wow.... I've never actually met anyone who had the same name as a character on the show.
22226	J.D. & Turk	Really?
22227	Mr. James	No.
22228	J.D.	Oh, well, that's understandable
22229	Turk	Yeah.
22230	J.D.	I mean, there's a lot of Sams....
22231	Turk	There's probably a lot of Carlas
22232	Elliot	Excuse me, J.D.! Ahem. I just spent the last three hours interviewing two hundred and twelve hypochondriacs half of whom don't speak any English! Do you have any idea how embarrassing it is to mime "diarrhea"!?
22233	J.D.	Talk about your Dianes!
22234	Turk	Oh, damn! It's kiss time!
22235	Carla	Ooh!
22236	Turk	Ahh. Baby.Baby!Come here, girl! Right here! That's where I want it! I want it right there!
22237	Turk & Carla	Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah!
22238	Carla	Where've you been?
22239	Turk	I was up at the Nurses' Station!
22240	Carla	I was looking all over for you!
22241	Turk	We
22242	Turk & Carla	Gotta go.
22243	Dr. Cox	Bob. Bob.Sorry, Madge.
22244	Dr. Kelso	What do you want, Perry?
22245	Dr. Cox	Bob, enough of the stinking budget cuts, already!
22246	Dr. Kelso	Noted. Now, if you will excuse me, I have to fire someone.
22247	Dr. Cox	Oh, baloney, old man!
22248	Dr. Kelso	I have to cut twenty-seven thousand dollars from the cafeteria budget! And my idea of getting it all back by charging a hundred bucks for a piece of cake went right out the window when Fat Frank decided to go on that power diet!
22249	Fat Frank	I lost over two hundred-thirty pounds so far!
22250	Dr. Kelso	I don't know why he keeps wearing those pants.
22251	Dr. Cox	All right, fair enough. Now I got your little budget reports! You don't know who to fire, do you!
22252	Dr. Kelso	Fine. Keep 'em. You do it!
22253	Dr. Cox	Watch and learn. I'll do it, and I'll do it without firing a single person.I have to fire someone.
22254	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22255	Elliot	I can't believe you left me all alone for a stupid T.V. writer.
22256	J.D.	Oh, like that is any different from the time you spent all night hanging out with your favorite weatherman from channel 4!
22257	Elliot	The man had a massive heart attack! I was nothing but professional!Okay, he's stable! Take the picture, Carla!
22258	J.D.	What do you want me to do?
22259	Elliot	I want you to go in there and tell Mr. James that there's absolutely no reason for him to be up here.
22260	J.D.	Mr. James, how long have you had that cough?
22261	Mr. James	Oh, a couple of months now.
22262	J.D.	Am I wrong, Elliot, or is that the kind of cough that needs a chest x-ray?
22263	Elliot	Probably.
22264	J.D.	Thank you.

22266	Figsack	Hey, yo, Turk.
22267	Turk	What's up?
22268	Figsack	I got a break. You wanna play some ball?
22269	Turk	Definitely.Baby. Yeah, I'm not gonna be able to make our next appointment kiss.
22270	Carla	I'm swamped, too. Yeah, right now I'm helping Dr. Schwartz reset a patient's leg. Oh, I think you got it, Dr. Schwartz.You're a liar!

22272	Jordan	Oh, for God's sake, Perry! Adjust your bra, man up, and fire the one with the least pathetic story!
22273	Dr. Cox	Do you really think I know any of these people's stories?
22274	Janitor	Well, let me fill you in. First we have Hank four kids, trying to make it on a dishwasher's salary. Next one is Mike lost half his leg in a motorcycle accident. And then there's Judy been here thirty years, just two away from retirement.
22275	Jordan	You're...you're friends with all these people?
22276	Janitor	You kidding me? I read their files. I read everybody's files, Ms. Manic-Depressive, Dr. Drinks A Lot.
22277	Dr. Cox	Hold your horses. Just tell me who the last person hired was, would you please?
22278	Kenny	Looks like you folks could use a little refresher! Serving people like you who save lives every day, makes me happier than a kitten chasing a leaky cow! God bless ya! God bless ya.
22279	Dr. Cox	I have to fire Opie, don't I.
22280	Jordan	You think?

22282	Elliot	Metastatic lung cancer? How was he even walking around with this?
22283	J.D.	At worst I thought maybe he had a bad case of bronchitis.
22284	Elliot	This is gonna suck.
22285	Mr. James	Why'd they move me up here?
22286	J.D.	Uh, Mr. James, I'm not quite sure how to say this, but...you have lung cancer...
22287	J.D.'s Narration	It was strange telling Mr. James he may only have a few weeks to live when just a few short hours ago we all thought he was fine....or realizing your relationship may not be as stable as you thought...
22288	Carla	We couldn't even make it one day.
22289	J.D.'s Narration	...or having to do someone else's dirty work for them...
22290	Dr. Cox	Say, Kenny? Can I talk to you for a second?
22291	J.D.'s Narration	...there are moments when we all wish life was more like a sitcom.
22292	Elliot	I'm so sorry.
22293	J.D.	I'm sorry, too, sir.
22294	Mr. James	Well, the good news is I won't have to eat my wife's cooking anymore, right!
22295	J.D.'s Thoughts	J.D.'s sitcom fantasy will be back after these messages!
22296	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22297	J.D.'s Thoughts	J.D.'s sitcom fantasy is filmed in front of a live studio audience.
22298	Mr. James	It's weird, there's just so many things I never got to do in my life...like go to a carnival or take a ride in a hot-air balloon.
22299	Elliot	We can do all that! We are gonna give you the best day ever!
22300	J.D.	Elliot, a word!A hot-air balloon seems kind of dangerous, I mean, he could get hurt.
22301	Elliot	What's he gonna do? Bruise one of his giant malignant tumors?
22302	J.D.	Safety is always important, Elliot.
22303	Elliot	Oh, my God. You're afraid of balloon rides, aren't you!
22304	J.D.	It's floating wicker propelled by fire!Besides, I defy you to find one other thing that I'm afraid of!
22305	Janitor	Mopping time! Mopping time! It's mopping time!Yes, it's mopping time, my friend! And as you know, I always like to start in the exact spot you're standing. Let's get to work.Here we go.
22306	J.D.	Is that my new sweater?!
22307	Janitor	No, this is my new sweater mop.
22308	J.D.	It went dynamite with my beige cords!
22309	Janitor	You mean my beige cord sponge?
22310	Kenny	You You wanted to see me?
22311	Dr. Cox	Hell yeah, I wanted to see you. I wanted to tell you that I...I think you're doing a great job. Boy, that meatloaf today, it was it was virtually hairless.
22312	Kenny	I took off the gloves and...it makes the hair a lot easier to...pick out.
22313	Dr. Cox	Get outta here.
22314	Dr. Kelso	Perry? Why the hell is he still here? When I go back down to the cafeteria, there had better be only three workers there! Unless Margaret spits out another kid that woman's like a Catholic bunny.Get it done!
22315	Dr. Cox	Why? Why am I having such a hard time with this?
22316	Jordan	Because apparently you have girl parts!
22317	Dr. Cox	Kelso said that if we can cover his salary in the budget, that Kenny can stay! But where are we gonna come up twenty-six thousand, three-hundred and seventy-two dollars?You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
22318	Jordan	Yeah! That that ohhhh! That we invite Muscles, here, to hang a banner in our bedroom that says "It takes three to party"?
22319	Dr. Cox	All right , knuckleheads! I need one of you to win this talent show!
22320	Elliot	I can do Shakespeare in German!In college I double majored in theatre and classic languages.
22321	J.D.	Does that degree come with headgear and allergies?
22322	Dr. Cox	Let's take a look at our other options. Gandhi? You appear to be a man that is utterly without talent. Unless, of course, you wanna count the fact that you are the twentieth-best basketball player in a predominately white hospital?Jordan, your only skill is illegal in twenty-six states.
22323	Jordan	It's twenty-seven. Arkansas buckled.
22324	Dr. Cox	Carla, that makes you my girl. Hell, we could crank up the humidity and watch your hair explode, that'd be terrific.Which leaves me, and, unless all of you wanna see me turn a two-syllable word into a six-syllable word, I re-he-he-he-he-heally think that we should keep looking.
22325	J.D.	You know what, save your breath! I'm about to get in a hot-air balloon and get Evil Knievel on my own ass!Come on, Elliot! Let's go French kiss the sun!
22326	Carla	You know, you're wrong about Turk he has many, many talents. Yeah, he's really good at not finding five seconds to kiss his wife.
22327	Turk	Wow! That's interesting, because you're really good at that, too!
22328	Carla	Oh, really?
22329	Turk	Really.
22330	Carla	Really?
22331	Turk	Really!
22332	Carla	Because at least I can remember how long we been married or what our song is!
22333	Turk	I don't know the name of it, but I know it goes like this!
22334	Carla	Are you humming the "let's all go to the movies" song?
22335	Turk	Is that not our song?
22336	Carla	It's sung by hot dogs!
22337	Mr. James	What an amazing day! A balloon ride! Lunch by the beach! And my first carnival!
22338	Elliot	Yeah. Sorry you missed out on getting your face painted.
22339	Mr. James	Well, they only had time to paint one more face, so I let the kid behind me go, make him stop crying.
22340	J.D.	That was awesome!
22341	Dr. Cox	Spidergirl.All right, talent show's about to start.
22342	Mr. James	Talent show? I'd love to see it, but I'm too tired to get out of bed.
22343	J.D.	That sucks for you!I'm just kidding! We're gonna do it right here!
22344	Elliot	Oh, Romeo, Romeo, Warum bist du Romeo? Verleugne deinen Vater und entsage deinem Namen. Oder wenn du das nicht willst, so SCHWÖRE hier...
22345	Carla	Gesundheit.
22346	Janitor	Hey, I'm wondering, what's the story with steel wool? I mean, is it steel or is it wool?Make up your mind, steel wool. Are there iron sheep hopping around in Scotland?Oh, brother. Look, I, uh...either start laughing or I start unplugging your machines.
22347	J.D.	And if any of you cows, goats, or ducks have any questions, don't be afraid to ask me! I'm just like all of you, only giant and human!Thank you. I hope you enjoyed our production of World's Most Giant Doctor Goes to the Farm.
22348	Turk	So what did we end up going with?Ah! You went with the farm idea!
22349	Dr. Cox	Oh my God, we're doomed.
22350	Dr. Kelso	Okay, Perry! That's it, it's over. The only act left to see is you firing that guy.
22351	Jordan	Wait, wait, wait! There's one more contestant!
22352	Dr. Cox	Oh, no. Is that Kenny?
22353	Kenny	Hi, I'm Kenny.
22354	Jordan	Yeah it is.
22355	Kenny	Isn't she lovely? Isn't she wonderful? Isn't she precious? Less than one minute old...
22356	Carla	Hey, that that's our song!
22357	Turk	Yeah, I know, I told him to sing it.
22358	Kenny	...Isn't she lovely, made from love!
22359	Dr. Cox	All right now, Bobbo, you give it to him. You know he deserves it.
22360	Dr. Kelso	The winner!
22361	Dr. Cox	Atta boy!
22362	Carla	Uh, Turk and I are gonna go home and spend some time together. Some GOOD TIME!
22363	Turk	And by "good time" she means bumping uglies!
22364	J.D.	Well, I hope you had a good day, Mr. James!
22365	Elliot	Wait a second! This chart isn't for Charles James, it's for James Charles! He's the one who has cancer, not you!
22366	J.D.	And who cares about him! He's anti-Semitic!
22367	Mr. James	Well, that's a load off my mind!
22368	J.D.	Hey everybody!Thanks for coming so quickly.You know, this is the kind of thing I normally say out loud in my head, but since we're all here...It just seems like, in the end, everything always works out. Because as long as we
22369	Elliot	Mr. James? Mr. James, can you hear me?
22370	J.D.	Wait, this isn't right.
22371	Elliot	We're gonna intubate!dopamine! Wide open! I need an ET tube. Where's anesthesia?
22372	J.D.'s Narration	Unfortunately, around here things don't always end as neat and tidy as they do in sitcoms.Relationships aren't always magically fixed in thirty minutes you have to work on them.Problems don't always have easy solutions.
22373	Dr. Cox	Hey, Kenny, once again I'm...I'm real sorry.
22374	Dr. Kelso	Welcome to my world. Now, imagine going home to my wife.
22375	J.D.'s Narration	And around here, nice people don't always get better.And at times like that, it's comforting to know there's always one thing that can pick your spirits up.
22376	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22377	J.D.'s Narration	Kylie wanted to take things slowly. So, seventeen dates in, I was basically embroiled in the world's longest make-out session.
22378	Kylie	Too much kissing?
22379	J.D.	No, no. Come on, I still have a little saliva left.
22380	J.D.'s Narration	As I felt the onslaught of what can only be described as a vicious tongue cramp, I decided it was time to let Kylie see my favorite dance. The "For God's sake, invite me to stay over" dance.
22381	J.D.'s Thoughts	The dance begins with a subtle hint.
22382	J.D.	I am so pooped.
22383	J.D.'s Thoughts	Step Two: Sashay her into sympathy.
22384	J.D.	It's chilly out there.
22385	Kylie	It is cold.
22386	J.D.'s Thoughts	Finally, sweep her off her feet with your vulnerable cuteness.
22387	J.D.	You know what I call this weather? Snuggle weather.
22388	J.D.'s Thoughts	Tip the band leader and fluff up the pillows, because this dance is done.
22389	Kylie	You should go.
22390	Teddy Bear	Yeah, hit the bricks, bitch. You got no game! Ha ha ha ha ha!
22391	J.D.'s Narration	I wasn't the only one having relationship trouble.
22392	Carla	You have to move out.
22393	J.D.	What? Is this about the bra catapult thing? Because if it's that big a deal, I can throw my own water balloons. I don't need those C-cups.
22394	Carla	J.D.! We're newlyweds! That's hard enough, and when you're around Tell him, Turk.
22395	Turk	You're all up in our space!
22396	J.D.	What? When have I ever been all up in your space?
22397	Carla	This is nice.
22398	Turk	Mm-hmm.
22399	J.D.	Whooooo! Sorry about the twosie, guys.Huh. And here I thought that was a lovely evening.
22400	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22401	Dr. Cox	Guys, guys, guys. You've all been working here for two years. Now why do I have to keep teaching you the same stuff?
22402	Lonnie	Can we take a break? The sun is scorching, and I'm very fair-skinned.
22403	Dr. Cox	You've only been out here for eight minutes.
22404	Lonnie	Whatever.
22405	Jordan	Ah, the intern car wash. Are you saving up so you can finally get those pec implants replaced?
22406	Dr. Cox	Ron is coming to town today
22407	Jordan	Mm.
22408	Dr. Cox	Speaking of which, I need to see you put on something a bit nicer.
22409	Jordan	You know, this whole competition thing that you have happening with your high school buddy, it is very, very boring. You know, like you were the homecoming king, he was the prom king. You went to medical school, he went to business school. You got divorced, he got divorced.
22410	Dr. Cox	Yeah, but he never has to see his wife anymore, so technically he's got me beat on that one.
22411	Jordan	Eh.
22412	Dr. Cox	Look, I am not going to let this weekend become about who's a bigger man. Ron's bringing his kid I can't wait to meet the child. And when he pulls in here in his crappy rent-a-car and he gets one look at my hand-polished Porsche, well, naturally, I'll have the lead.
22413	Jordan	Very exciting.
22414	Ron	Hoo-hoo! Hey. Hey, guys. Oh, I know the chopper seems like a bit much, but, uh, there was crazy traffic, so I'm having my assistant drive my rental car over from the airport ah!Well, it hardly seems worth it now, but what the hell? Ha! So, Perr, what are you driving these days?Well, that ol' girl needs a wash.
22415	Dr. Cox	Thank you, Ron.
22416	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22417	Elliot	I can't believe Turk and Carla are kicking me out.Mm. When I was fifteen, my parents threatened to do the same thing, so I called them on it.
22418	J.D.	They let you stay?
22419	Elliot	Nope. I lived with the Babcocks for two years.
22420	J.D.	Oh.
22421	J.D.'s Thoughts	All right, Carla calls the shots. Appeal to her rational side.
22422	J.D.	Carla, I totally understand you guys need your space, but with work and my financial situation, finding a new place is gonna be, minimum, two to four years.
22423	Carla	Come on, Bambi. Aren't there any other married couples that want to live in a small apartment with a 29-year-old man?
22424	J.D.'s Thoughts	She called me a man!
22425	J.D.	Turk, I've always had your back and you always had mine. Are you sure you want to go through with this?
22426	Turk	It was my idea.
22427	J.D.	I banged your first girlfriend.
22428	Turk	Chantal?
22429	J.D.	Now, look, I need a favor. Let me try it. I'll move out for a week; if you still like it, I'll move out for good.All right. And d-d-d-don't worry about John Dorian, because I may be poor in pocket, but I'm rich in friends!
22430	Elliot	Nope.
22431	J.D.'s Thoughts	That's okay, because when God closes a window, he opens a door.
22432	Kylie	I'm just not sure I'm comfortable with you sleeping here.
22433	J.D.	Kylie, I hear you. But trust me, this week is not gonna be about sex. Even though I think we both agree that's where we'd eventually like our relationship to end up, right?
22434	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22435	Ron	It's good to see you, buddy.
22436	Dr. Cox	It is great to see you, I'll tell you that!
22437	Ron	Looks like we got ourselves in a little walking hug here. What say we, uh
22438	Dr. Cox	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
22439	Ron	So look at you, Mr. Big Time Doctor!
22440	Dr. Cox	How about you, Mr. Big Time...I don't actually know what you do.
22441	Ron	Man, I've told you a hundred times: I run mergers and acquisitions for a large private equity hedge fund.
22442	Dr. Cox	No, no. You do hedge clippings for a big farm.
22443	Ron	Wha?
22444	Dr. Cox	You privately acquire hedgehogs.
22445	Ron	You know what, your crush on my mom was cute when we were fourteen, but the woman's 85 now. You need to back off. Or we can ask her out to dinner. I'll have her pop in her "going out" teeth and you two can see if there's any real spark.Jordan.
22446	Jordan	Hi.
22447	Ron	Will you be joining us for dinner?
22448	Jordan	No way. Every time we go out, the whole night turns into a giant pissing contest.
22449	Dr. Cox	No, it doesn't.First one who tags the dog wins.
22450	Ron	Count it.
22451	Dr. Cox	You know, I've seen that dog around the neighborhood. I think we killed its spirit.
22452	Ron	Yeah.
22453	Dr. Cox	Look, why don't you bring Nathan over to our place tonight? The kids can play, and we can forget all about this competition crap.
22454	Ron	I'd like that.
22455	Dr. Cox	So would I.Jack is going to kick Nathan's ass at playing!
22456	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22457	Carla	Woo! How great is it not having J.D. around, huh?
22458	Turk	Ha! So great. So great.... Now what?
22459	Carla	Well, let's see. Did it on the couch.
22460	Turk	Uh-huh.
22461	Carla	Did it in the kitchen.
22462	Turk	Oh, yes, we did.
22463	Carla	Wanna do it on J.D.'s bed?
22464	Turk	I think it's about time someone did.You don't really want to have more sex, do you?
22465	Carla	God, no, I didn't even want to do it in the kitchen.
22466	Turk	Whenever J.D. and I are bored, we like to play a little game called "toe or finger"?
22467	Carla	Uh-huh?
22468	Turk	You close your eyes, and I run either a toe or finger underneath your nose and try to guess which one it is! Huh!?
22469	Carla	Usually when J.D. gets off work, we gossip about hospital stuff.
22470	Turk	Baby, that sounds a little immature.
22471	Carla	Okay! Then, you know, what the hell are we supposed to do?
22472	Elliot	Hi, guys! Thanks for inviting me over!
22473	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22474	J.D.	Thanks for letting us crash here, man.
22475	Todd	The Todd's not accustomed to receiving gentleman callers.
22476	J.D.	Okay....
22477	Todd	Oh, I don't swim.
22478	J.D.	Oh, I don't I don't have one of those, Todd.
22479	Todd	No problem.
22480	J.D.	Extra-medium.
22481	Todd	This'll work. And it'll look good, too.

22483	Dr. Cox	All right, Jack, listen to me. Ron's in the bathroom diapering his kid. When he gets out, it's playtime.
22484	Ron	27-second diaper change.
22485	Dr. Cox	I can change a diaper in twenty seconds.
22486	Jordan	Oh, my God!
22487	Dr. Cox	Say, Ronnie, what say we let the kids play for a while?
22488	Ron	You know, uh, Nathan is actually in the 90th percentile in height.
22489	Dr. Cox	Jack's only in the 85th.
22490	Ron	Aw.
22491	Dr. Cox	Of course, he's in the 99th for head size.
22492	Ron	Congratulations. Your son's the Hamburgler.
22493	Dr. Cox	Head size is directly related to intelligence.
22494	Ron	Really?
22495	Dr. Cox	Oh....
22496	Carla	Oh! And Laverne told me that Nurse Tisdale is sleeping with that married albino radiologist.
22497	Elliot	Oh, I feel so bad for his wife.
22498	Carla	Elliot! It's not about empathy, it's about judging people.
22499	Elliot	Can't we do something else?
22500	Turk	Okay, you know what, I vote Elliot goes home! Because she's all up in our space, honey! She's in our space!
22501	Elliot	Oh, why? Because I don't want to dish about other people behind their backs or smell your toe?
22502	Turk	Or finger!
22503	Elliot	All I've seen so far is the toe, Turk!

22505	Jordan	See you tomorrow, guys!Look, Perry, we just have to accept Jack the way he is, love him unconditionally, and enroll him in some sort of block-building class.
22506	Dr. Cox	Look at these things, Jordan.
22507	Jordan	Yeah?
22508	Dr. Cox	The color coordination, the the symmetry. A two-year-old shouldn't be able to do this kind of stuff.
22509	Jordan	What are you trying to say?
22510	J.D.'s Narration	They say just admitting there's a problem is half the battle......even if it's something you didn't expect...
22511	Elliot	What is wrong with you guys?
22512	Carla	We miss J.D.
22513	J.D.'s Narration	The bottom line is, when the warning signs are right in front of you, there's no denying the truth.
22514	Dr. Cox	Nathan has classic signs of Autism.
22515	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22516	Dr. Cox	Ron's kid doesn't make eye contact, he barely speaks, and he freaked out when you tried to cuddle him. I mean, hell, if he was an adult, he'd be, well...you know...me. But those behaviors in a child could point towards Autism. I think it's pretty obvious what we have to do.
22517	Jordan	Grit our teeth, get through the weekend, never speak to Ron again?
22518	Dr. Cox	Exactly.
22519	Jordan	Mm-hmm.
22520	Elliot	I cannot believe what I just heard!
22521	Dr. Cox	The tick-tocking of your biological clock leading you towards the corner of Celibate and Spinster Way?
22522	Jordan	Sometimes it's great to already have a bastard child.
22523	Dr. Cox	You said it.
22524	Elliot	You know, it is our obligation as doctors to tell someone when there is a problem.Good God, you smell like baby.
22525	Dr. Cox	I've only actually met the child once, so I think it's pretty important that we figure out a way to spend some alone-time with him.
22526	Jordan	Perry, if I'm gonna be spending a lot of time with someone else's child, it's gonna be with our neighbor's 17-year-old.

22528	J.D.	Hello! Anybody home?
22529	Carla	J.D., we're right here!
22530	J.D.'s Thoughts	Tell them you want to come back!
22531	J.D.	I just came by to get my toothbrush.
22532	Turk	Carla took your toothbrush out the bathroom and put it in the hall closet.
22533	J.D.	Finger. Bingo.
22534	Carla	We should ask him back.
22535	Turk	Baby, no. We're too proud. We are the proud Turks.
22536	J.D.	Hey, guys! The heater's broken again.
22537	Carla	What happened?
22538	J.D.'s Thoughts	I clubbed it with a Mag-Lite.
22539	J.D.	I could probably stay and fix it. It could take three, four, five days.
22540	Turk	I did a triple bypass yesterday. I think I could fix the heater.
22541	J.D.	Suit yourself.
22542	Janitor	So I hear you're homeless. I wanna volunteer, give you a place to stay.
22543	J.D.	I don't think so, buddy.
22544	Janitor	Listen, crash in my garage. I guarantee you there will not be another person in there.
22545	J.D.	You're gonna slather jam on my face and sic a family of raccoons on me, aren't you!
22546	Janitor	Damn it. I've become predictable.
22547	J.D.	I'm out.
22548	Janitor	Oh, yeah? Well, from what I hear I'm your last option.
22549	J.D.	Options?! I got cable TV and a dead dog! I got plenty of options!
22550	Ted	Come on in. I've got a huge king bed. It'll be nice to have a buffer between me and my mom.
22551	Lonnie	Sorry, bro. We're a little crowded tonight.
22552	J.D.	Lonnie, you have three kids?
22553	Lonnie	That I know of.
22554	Ed McMahon	Yeah?
22555	J.D.	Does Doug Murphy live here?
22556	Ed McMahon	The pathologist?
22557	J.D.	Yeah.
22558	Ed McMahon	No. He moved out.
22559	J.D.	Okay.... But, Mr. McMahon, would you mind

22563	Ron	So, why do you wanna baby-sit my kid? You think I can't handle my own kid?
22564	Dr. Cox	No, that's not it at all. I think you're great with your kid. You're fantastic with your kid. In fact, in fact if you want, you can baby-sit my kid.
22565	Ron	Are we really doing this? 'Cause I'll baby-sit the hell outta your kid.
22566	Dr. Cox	Oh, bring it on, daddy.
22567	J.D.	Who needs a baby-sitter? I'll do it! You don't even have to pay me in cash, just pay me in hot showers. And you don't have to, like, wash me unless you want to, but that could be weird. I don't know.
22568	Dr. Cox	Newbie, I've got this one covered.
22569	J.D.	Come on, you two are interracial best buddies. I, too, have a black best friend. Go out, enjoy it! Celebrate your uniqueness! I can do it!
22570	Ron	I'm sorry. Did you just call me black? Because the last time I checked, the correct term was "African-American."
22571	J.D.	Well, Turk lets me call him Brown Bear.
22572	Ron	Who the hell is Turk?!
22573	J.D.	I should go.
22574	Dr. Cox	Angry black man. It never disappoints.
22575	Ron	I pull it out when I need to.
22576	Dr. Cox	Well, what do you say?
22577	Ron	Well, I do have a lot of work to get done.... You can watch Nate.
22578	Dr. Cox	You got it.

22582	Turk	Baby?
22583	Carla	Hmm?
22584	Turk	Could you get me a towel so I could wipe this sweat from my head?
22585	Carla	They're all dirty, okay? J.D. used to wash them.
22586	Turk	It's so hot! When the hell is he gonna finish fixing the heater?!
22587	Carla	It's okay! He's a professional I'm sure he's almost done.
22588	Janitor	This...should not have been removed.

22590	Kylie	Todd made you wear a banana hammock to bed?
22591	J.D.	It was horrible. I kept imagining I was an Olympic diver.
22592	Kylie	Well, it means a lot to me that you would go through all that just to respect my boundaries.
22593	J.D.	Thanks, Kylie. I can just sleep on the couch.
22594	Kylie	You don't have to crash on the couch.Well, Dr. Dorian, are you gonna join me?
22595	J.D.'s Thoughts	I couldn't have planned it better.
22596	Carla	J.D.!
22597	J.D.	I don't want to come home. It took me a month to get here from the couch.
22598	Kylie	Uh, J.D., maybe you should go home.
22599	J.D.'s Thoughts	Get the moment back! Say something hot!

22602	Elliot	I think it is so great that you're gonna talk to your friend. And I know it's gonna be hard, so if you need me, you just say the word and I will jump right in.

22604	Ron	That little guy's my life.
22605	Elliot	I've gotta go.
22606	Ron	What's up?
22607	Dr. Cox	Ron, there is no easy way to do this, so I'm just gonna go ahead and say it.
22608	Ron	This is...this is unbelievable.
22609	Dr. Cox	I know, but the good news here is that we found out early, so you can be as proactive as you
22610	Ron	No, no, no. You are unbelievable. I mean...you can't handle the fact that my kid is better than your kid at building blocks, so you tell me there's something wrong with him?!
22611	Dr. Cox	That's just not gonna happen. No way.
22612	J.D.'s Narration	At first I was a little disappointed that I wasn't sleeping at Kylie's, but it was good to be home.
22613	J.D.	I'm home!You guys moved couch?
22614	J.D.'s Narration	It's always nice to let your friends know that you appreciate them.
22615	Turk	I'm glad you're home, buddy.
22616	J.D.	I missed you, my African-American friend.
22617	Turk	Call me Brown Bear.
22618	J.D.	Brown Bear.
22619	Dr. Cox	This, uh...is a classmate of mine from medical school. He's located up in your area now. I think he'd really be able to help you.
22620	J.D.'s Narration	But sometimes you just can't quite find words to show that appreciation.
22621	Ron	You know, uh...I just wanna say that, uh, I'm gonna handle this kid situation so much better than you ever could.
22622	Dr. Cox	Oh, give me a break. I would kick your ass in situation-handling. I'm a doctor, for God sakes. And, for the record, the Vegas odds-makers are makin' Coxy a heavy favorite.
22623	Ron	Well, then, I would just bet on me and make a bundle.
22624	Dr. Cox	You know what? I probably would, too.
22625	J.D.	Aha! Behold, the Twinkie from the first day we moved in! I owe you an apology, Turk.
22626	Turk	Of course.Heh. Want some?
22627	Carla	No.
22628	Turk	Okay, fine. More for me.
22629	Carla	So, Bambi, what's the deal with all the things you do around here?
22630	J.D.	What do you mean?
22631	Carla	The laundry, the fixing the radiator, the listening to me gossip and playing stupid games with Turk. How do you make yourself do all that stuff?
22632	J.D.'s Narration	At the end of the day, the best thing to do for your friends is to be honest.
22633	J.D.	I don't know, I never really thought about it. I guess when you care about someone, you'll do whatever you can to make 'em happy.
22634	J.D.'s Narration	You just have to hope that your honesty doesn't make them realize something they didn't wanna know.

22666	Dr. Cox	I do. But here I really have no need for a cracked thermos and two

22676	Molly	Hey stranger. Ouch!
22677	J.D.	*So Molly's back in town. She definitely wants me.*
22678	Molly	Bye. How you doing, J.J.?
22679	J.D.	That's J.D.
22680	Molly	Oh, right. I was just thinking of that Jimmy Walker sitcom.
22681	J.D.	Good Times?
22682	Molly	Not great, my sister had a miscarriage.
22683	Elliot	Molly? Oh my God! You look fantastic!
22684	Molly	So do you!
22685	Elliot	How's Milwaukee?
22686	Molly	It's okay. I'm just here to see a patient.
22687	J.D.	*Even though she did the fake forget-my-name thing, she's here for me.
22688	Patient	They've landed. Grab some blankets and all the canned goods you can
22689	Molly	Apparently he's gotten really possessive of me. He won't talk to the
22690	J.D.	Molly, I'm sure he's not that possessive.
22691	Patient	Get away from my doctor!
22692	J.D.	Get him off! Get him off!
22693	Molly	Patrick, down.
22694	Turk	It is so good to laugh like this with
22695	Dr. Cox	I'm on a break here, Newbie. Just tell your shiny headed roommate
22696	J.D.	Would you give him a break? He's talking to his wife.
22697	Carla	Has anybody seen Mr. Jennings' file? Oh,
22698	Dr. Cox	This just got interesting.
22699	J.D.	Who are you talking to?
22700	Turk	Rosanna.
22701	J.D.	Your college girlfriend?
22702	Turk	Yeah.
22703	J.D.	Can I say hi?
22704	Turk	Yeah.
22705	J.D.	Hey Rosanna.
22706	Turk	Dude, what the hell!
22707	Rosanna	Hello? Hello? J.D.?
22708	J.D.	This phone is indestructible! If it has a camera, I'm so getting one.
22709	Rosanna	Is anybody there?
22710	Turk	Dude!!!
22711	J.D.	Why are you talking to your college girlfriend?
22712	Turk	We're just friends!
22713	Kelso	Ahhh, just friends... I was just friends once with a Vietnamese girl.
22714	Cox	Unlike you, Bobbo, Gandhi here is in a healthy relationship. I mean,
22715	Turk	He gets me.
22716	J.D.	Give me a pound, dawg.
22717	Kelso	Does he know you were being sarcastic?
22718	Cox	I hope not.
22719	Kelso	Splendid.
22720	Janitor	Gentlemen. Crazy-Eyes Margo. I've called the Brain Trust together
22721	Randall	Burn down her apartment.
22722	Troy	I have an idea. But we're going to need a tugboat.
22723	Janitor	Tugboats and arson, that's all I ever get from you guys. We call
22724	Molly	So, you seeing anyone?
22725	Elliot	I went on a few dates with a guy named Rick, but then he met my mom
22726	Molly	She didn't like him?
22727	Elliot	No, she loved him. They're in Aruba.
22728	J.D.	God, I'd love to get with Molly.
22729	Turk	Dude, you're pretty horny for a guy who claims to be getting it on a
22730	J.D.	What are you implying?
22731	Turk	Let's just say a little birdie told me that you and Kylie haven't
22732	J.D.	Who?
22733	Turk	Nurse Birdie.
22734	Nurse Birdie	Well, you haven't.
22735	J.D.	I trusted you!
22736	Turk	Dude, it's been a month.
22737	J.D.	Oh really Turk? Has it been a month? Because time just flies when
22738	Turk	Look. Kylie hasn't slept with you so what she's saying is that she
22739	J.D.	She did go to a movie with her brother-in-law.
22740	Turk	That's perfect. Dude, you can have your cake and eat it too. It's like
22741	J.D.	That is the dumbest idea I've ever heard.
22742	Todd	So once you've got the hole at the bottom of the popcorn box, it's
22743	Doug	And for the record, that technique does not work with hot nachos.
22744	Ted	You want to get Elliot, get in good with her best friend.
22745	Janitor	Who's Elliot? Oooh.
22746	Ted	Trust me. The way I got my girlfriend in junior high was by getting her
22747	Janitor	And how'd you do that?
22748	Ted	I posed as her dad so she could rent a car. I lost my hair in eighth
22749	Todd	Tough break five.
22750	Janitor	I'm going in. Um. We should be friends.
22751	Molly	Okay.
22752	Janitor	Do you like vanning?
22753	Molly	I don't know what that is.
22754	Janitor	It's kind of my thing. It's like taking a long drive in a car, only
22755	Molly	I'm still not getting it.
22756	Janitor	Could you hang on for one sec?
22757	Carla	Turk. I found your cell phone in the parking lot.
22758	J.D.	Four stories and not a scratch. What are you made of?
22759	Carla	You got three missed phone calls. All from a Rosanna. Isn't that your
22760	Elliot	So, what's been going on with you?
22761	Molly	I went to India for two weeks.
22762	Kelso	Ladies, this is a hospital, not the junior league. Let's break it up.
22763	Molly	I moved to Milwaukee four months ago.
22764	Kelso	Welcome back.
22765	Elliot	So this trip to India sounds so exotic.
22766	J.D.	Hey, Kylie. I was calling to see how your day was going.
22767	Molly	...this ninety degree cave and sweat would just be dripping off our
22768	J.D.	Naked sweat drips...
22769	Kylie	What?
22770	J.D.	Um, nothing, Kylie. It's a new band called the Naked Sweat Drips. They
22771	Molly	...And then I got so flexible I could put my legs behind my head.
22772	Kylie	J.D., are you there?
22773	Molly	You should come.
22774	Elliot	Oh, frick on a stick. I gotta go. I want to hear the rest of the
22775	J.D.	Feet up behind her head.
22776	Kylie	Who has their feet behind their head?
22777	J.D.	A patient, Kylie. Horrible car accident. You gotta wear your seatbelt,
22778	Molly	Hey. I'm getting out of here. Do you want to grab a beer?
22779	J.D.	*They say the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry.*
22780	Carla	I can't believe you've been talking to her.
22781	Turk	Now honey, is it possible you're making mountains out of molehills?
22782	Carla	Dammit!
22783	J.D.	*Still, sometimes, plans go exactly like they're supposed to.*
22784	Elliot	You paged me?
22785	Janitor	Yeah, look. I made a bet with Dr. Cox that you would go out with
22786	J.D.	*And the success of those plans can take even the most hardened men by
22787	Elliot	Do you mind? I'm trying to have a private moment with my man.
22788	Cox	Oh God...
22789	Elliot	I got lipstick on you.
22790	Janitor	No. Leave it.
22791	J.D.	*And sometimes, even the best of men can go awry.*
22792	Kylie	So, are you coming over tonight?
22793	Carla	Hey J.D.
22794	Turk	Buddy, you should try that cake I was telling you about!
22795	J.D.	Actually, Kylie. I... I can't tonight.*If having my cake and eating it too meant being with Molly, then
22796	Elliot	Hey guys, you going out?
22797	J.D.	Yeah! You should come with us!
22798	Molly	That's the 'Close' button.
22799	J.D.	Oh no, it's the 'Close' button. When somebody gets close it activates
22800	Molly	Fancy.
22801	J.D.	*Oh no! She's got a pinky hold! Elliot's got the pinky strength of a
22802	Elliot	You're pressing the
22803	J.D.	We haven't decided yet!
22804	Cox	I gotta tell you there, Supercuts. I've seen a lot of crazy things at
22805	Janitor	I'm going to paint your Porsche mint green so it looks like my
22806	Kelso	Trong Tree,
22807	Carla	Whoa! Rosanna gets her own personal ringtone but I don't?
22808	Turk	Baby, I don't have to answer this.
22809	Carla	It's cool. I got the ring that matters, right?
22810	Kelso	Nurse Turkleton, I want to talk to you about these discharge We can talk later.
22811	Elliot	You need to come get a drink.
22812	Carla	Yes I do.
22813	Elliot	Janitor! So, did Dr. Cox pay up?
22814	Janitor	No! No! He says that he needs to see us on an actual date. In a
22815	Elliot	Okay, meet me at Stanwick's?
22816	Janitor	Sure.Sorry guys, I can't go clubbing tonight. Daddy's got a date.
22817	Ted	Aw man! I ironed my going out hair!
22818	Molly	You know, they make thongs specifically for low-riders now.
22819	Elliot	They don't work for me. I still can't sit down without showing the
22820	J.D.	*Some guy... I never get credit for anything!*
22821	Carla	So you guys think I'm overreacting about this whole Turk thing?
22822	Elliot	Phone calls from an ex would drive me nuts!
22823	J.D.	*I knew how to get rid of both of them, but I can't do that to Turk.*
22824	Mr. Peeps	If you don't do it, I will.
22825	J.D.	*Mr. Peeps? Why are you British?*
22826	Mr. Peeps	I'll explain later. Just lose the extra bitches.
22827	J.D.	Carla, go talk to Turk. Share with him your feelings. That's what he
22828	Carla	Yeah?
22829	Elliot	Come on. I'll drive you. I gotta go to dinner anyway.
22830	Mr. Peeps	You're welcome.
22831	Molly	We should probably go too. It's getting late.
22832	J.D.	Oh, no no no. I just ordered two drinks.
22833	Carla	Hey Turk.
22834	Turk	I promise, I will visit you soon.
22835	Carla	I don't care if I seem crazy.
22836	Turk	Anything for you. You know that.
22837	Elliot	College was weird. I was so worried about being liked that I let my
22838	Janitor	Oh, I'm sure he'll be here soon. I kissed a dude once. It was at furnace camp.
22839	J.D.	*Okay J.D., you're a little drunk. And you know what happens when you
22840	Molly	It's tough making new friends in Milwaukee.
22841	J.D.	*I said control yourself!* You know
22842	Molly	You think so?
22843	J.D.	I do. *I knew at that moment what would happen if I reached over and
22844	Cox	Well, if
22845	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22846	Elliot	Wait, why did we just go out if you already have his car?
22847	Cox	Oh, my goodness. He actually tricked you into a date. This is so very
22848	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22849	Elliot	You're unbelievable.
22850	Janitor	You're the only one around here that treats me like a real person.
22851	Elliot	What did you just say?
22852	Janitor	There was one other girl, a few years ago... Red Haired Doctor. She
22853	Elliot	You know what, it's okay. I actually had a good time.
22854	Janitor	Thanks. Elliot.
22855	J.D.	Oh, Kylie. I'm sorry. I hope it's okay that I stopped by. What was that for?
22856	Kylie	I was thinking about how patient you've been with me. How right
22857	J.D.	Wait, are you saying that you're ready? Awesome.
22858	Kylie	First, let me set the mood.
22859	J.D.	And Kylie, you're right. It is fate. Because I was out with this girl
22860	Kylie	You blew me off tonight to be with some random girl?
22861	J.D.	Well, she's not a random girl. I mean, I had a crush on her long
22862	Mr. Peeps	I will kill you!
22863	Kylie	You should go.
22864	J.D.	*I was in trouble. And if I didn't play my cards right, I knew what*See, that's the thing about trying to have your cake and eating it
22865	Ted	We can fix that.
22866	Janitor	You guys are out.
22867	Randall	She's at a Ludacris concert with her birth mom.
22868	Janitor	I lose my van to him, and I lose Margo to gangsta rap. Bad day.
22869	J.D.	*And really, who wants to risk something important, just for a silly
22870	Turk	I did it! Cut off all ties with Rosanna. Forever.
22871	Carla	Baby, that took like twenty seconds. How did you do that so quickly?
22872	Turk	It was easy. I just told her I was married.
22873	Carla	You've been talking to this girl you used to sleep with, and you
22874	Turk	She never asked?
22875	Carla	It's no big deal. Because if you're lucky, maybe you won't be married
22876	Turk	Baby. Baby!
22877	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22878	J.D.	*In my four years there have been many emergencies at Sacred Heart, but none like this one, because today * Where is he? *Dr. Cox's son needed two stitches.* Dr. Cox, got here as soon as I
22879	Cox	Shut it, Newbie. Your blacker half is trying to concentrate.
22880	J.D.	How are you holding up?
22881	Turk	I'm a little nervous.
22882	J.D.	Well now you make me all nervous.
22883	Cox	I'd focus, because that tiny patch of skin on my son's forehead is more important to me than the entirety of your whole high-fiving, head-shaving, air-balling, mole-lipping, insulin-needing existence, which I guarantee you will come to an abrupt very unnatural end.
22884	Turk	Okay, I'm done.
22885	J.D.	*We all held our breath together.*
22886	Cox	The surgeon lives!
22887	J.D.	The Todd forgot to breathe again. Starting CPR.
22888	Elliot	Mr. Gerst, what seems to be the problem?
22889	Gerst	I took some pills.
22890	Elliot	Come on, help me out here. Were they happy pills, sad pills, sleepy pills, wake up pills, sane pills, pain pills, brain pills, Spain pills...
22891	Gerst	Man pills? The commercial says I should consult a physician if the condition persists for more than four hours.
22892	Elliot	If what persists? Oh! Um... Let's just say you took uppers.
22893	Turk	Hey dude, check out what I found when I was taking out the trash!
22894	J.D.	That is the most ridiculous hat I've ever seen. *And I must have it.*
22895	Turk	I've got time.
22896	J.D.	*Turk and Carla were having relationship troubles so she'd been staying at Elliot's for a few days.* You were late the last time.
22897	Turk	Yeah, but I set the clock ahead an hour last night so I wouldn't be late.
22898	J.D.	Yeah, but last week I set it back three hours so we could see what it felt like to live in Honolulu.
22899	Turk	Yeah, but then I set the clock ahead five hours so I wouldn't feel like a skeeve for watching porn in the middle of the day.
22900	J.D.	But then I set it back forty-three minutes to 8:08, turned the clock upside-down to see if it looked like the word Bob, which incidentally, it totally does
22901	Turk	That's true.
22902	J.D.	Which means that it's actually...
22903	Together	9:52!
22904	Turk	Oh my God, dude, I've got to be downtown in like eight minutes!Dude, we're never going to make it in time! Take the shortcut through that hedge!
22905	J.D.	You got it, player! Hold on buddy!
22906	Turk	That was a thick bush!
22907	J.D.	Oh really, Turk, was it a thick bush? Because there's berries in my ass! Just go!
22908	Turk	Sorry. My bad, dude, my bad.
22909	J.D.	Don't worry, Turk, I got 'em!
22910	Carla	Turk, why are you wearing pajamas?
22911	Turk	Uh, I really want you to come home and on the off chance you said yes, I'd be ready to snuggle. And that would hopefully lead to but not necessarily require relations of the intimate nature.
22912	Carla	Turk, with everything that's happened I'm just having trouble trusting you.
22913	Turk	Baby, if there's anyone in this world that you can trust, it's me.
22914	Carla	Turk, you're the one I don't know if I can trust, so how am I supposed to trust that I can trust you telling me that I can trust you?
22915	Turk	My head hurts.
22916	J.D.	I wish I knew how it was going. Sorry about your hogs, fellas. Enjoy the free espressos. Warlord, I told you to sip it. Use your words.
22917	Warlord	Warlord... burn mouth.
22918	J.D.	Yeah he did, because he wasn't listening. Napkin on your lap, Satan's Valet. Thank you.
22919	Cox	Hey. What are you doing, Frankenstein?
22920	Janitor	Photo journal. For my photography class.
22921	Cox	Terrific, could I see your camera? Very interesting. Oh, there's film in it.
22922	Janitor	Hey! All my pictures were in there! Dead patient with fancy shirt. Dead patient without fancy shirt. Me in fancy shirt being yelled at by angry family.
22923	Cox	Do you have any idea what events would unfold if Jordan were to actually see that picture? It is a heartwrenching tale of woe involving Jordan's second cousin who plays for the New England Patriots and me having a Super Bowl ring removed from my esophagus. No, Jordan's never going to see these stitches.
22924	Janitor	Well, I hope you realize this means war.
22925	Cox	Ah, buzz off, you big monkey.
22926	Elliot	Poor Mr. Gerst. I wonder what that's like, to have an erection for nine hours.
22927	Todd	Ask me in twenty minutes.
22928	Elliot	Oh, get this. He doesn't even have erectile dysfunction. I mean, why would you take those drugs if you didn't need them?
22929	Cox	What's this? Why, it's a dummy-gram. And it's addressed to you, Barbie. Let's read it and find out what's in there. "You are disturbingly naive. Stop. Almost fifty percent of ED drugs are taken by recreational users. Stop."
22930	Elliot	That can't be true.
22931	Cox	Everyone. Would you go ahead and close your eyes for a second? Great. Now, would all the men in the room who've tried Mr. Happy pills go ahead and grab your fork and bang your glass. Thank you!
22932	Elliot	Ted! Everyone stopped.
22933	Ted	Oh. Dammit!
22934	Turk	Dude, she's got this whole trust issue with me.
22935	J.D.	Just tell her she can trust you.
22936	Turk	I did. But apparently if I'm the one she didn't know she could trust, how's she supposed to trust she can trust me telling her she can trust me?
22937	J.D.	My head hurts.
22938	Turk	Yeah, mine did too. That's why I need you to go in.
22939	J.D.	No way, dude. It's never smart to get in the middle of someone else's relationship.
22940	Turk	I'll let you wear my top hat.
22941	J.D.	Hey! Wanna grab a beer?
22942	Carla	If you lose the hat.
22943	Jordan	Hi.
22944	Cox	Hello there.
22945	Jordan	What's with all the band-aids?
22946	Cox	Oh, Jack was just getting nutty, having some fun. See, I even let him put one on me.
22947	Jordan	Really? Are those stitches?!
22948	Cox	What are the odds you'd pick that one? Jack just He just fell off of the jungle gym.
22949	Jordan	You're not careful enough with him!
22950	Cox	What about the time you had him and he brained himself on the coffee table?
22951	Jordan	That was an accident.
22952	Cox	Just a quick question. Why is it an accident when he's with you, but when Jack gets hurt on my time it's because I'm not careful enough?
22953	Jordan	Because, I
22954	Cox	Oh dear God, you're speechless. I won! I won an argument! Jack, it's unprecedented. We'll be at the playground drinking beer. Oh God, we love beer!
22955	Paper Clip Intern	That guy needs to do some serious thinking about baseball.
22956	Todd	He wouldn't even let me see it.
22957	Elliot	Hey meathead! Oh good, you both looked. Now, Mr. Gerst came here for help, and we're doctors, so how about we try and treat him with at least a little bit of dignity and respect, okay?
22958	Kelso	That man is a human sundial!
22959	Carla	Oh, it's so nice to get out. Oh, hey do you know who sings this song?
22960	J.D.	No, but I can tell you who doesn't sing it. Billy Joel, who brought us such hits as "Uptown Girl" and "Matter of Trust". And speaking of trust, do you know who's really trustworthy? Turk. I call him Turkey Turkey Turkey Turkey Trust Trust. A little nickname.
22961	Carla	J.D., I know what you're trying to do and it's very sweet, but the last couple of days have been so messed up and confusing, I'd love to just try and forget about it and have a few drinks, okay?
22962	J.D.	But I told Turk I'd talk about him constantly until you made me leave.
22963	Carla	I'll let you put the hat back on.
22964	J.D.	Two appletinis, guv'ner!
22965	Dad	Look at my girl. Right back up on the monkey bars, even after she chipped her tooth there last week.
22966	Cox	That's nothing. My kid's got a forehead full of stitches from leaping off the jungle gym.
22967	Dad	When my wife's not around, I let my daughter stand on my shoulders.
22968	Cox	Really? Wait til you get a load of this. Okay, here we go. What a Come here you. You come here, you. A little girl approaches him.]
22969	Girl	Giant Man, why are you making that noise?
22970	Janitor	Oh. Well, cause my camera doesn't make a real sound, and it's more fun that way. See, here you go. Look happy. Look sad. Look crazy. Look like you're going away.
22971	Elliot	You're coming in because you need to set an example of professionalism and you're certainly not going to do that by making fun of that man's slinky-doo.
22972	Kelso	Don't pull me, I'm your boss for God's Hello!
22973	Elliot	So, Mr. Gerst. Your situation doesn't seem to be reversing itself. I think we're going to need to schedule a procedure to relieve the... uh...
22974	Kelso	Woodiness.
22975	Gerst	My fiancee's only twenty-four and she said she wanted to do something special this morning. Turns out she just meant having breakfast with her family. The pills didn't really kick in until just about the moment I'm introduced to her ninety year old grandma. Sure enough, that little lady gives me the waist hug from her wheelchair.
22976	Elliot	Excuse me, I need that chart.
22977	Kelso	Sweetheart, it's not healthy to hold it in. Just let it out. You know you want to.
22978	Elliot	I'm fine.
22979	Gerst	I pulled away from that encounter with all of Grandma Helen's breathing apparatus.
22980	Kelso	My work here is done.
22981	Elliot	Oh my God, I can't stop! Sorry! I have to pee!
22982	Carla	J.D., why are we sitting up here?
22983	J.D.	Because you can see Elliot's whole apartment from up here.
22984	Carla	J.D., you're drunk!
22985	J.D.	Carla, I'm not as think as you drunk I am. I mean...
22986	Carla	Then why can't you let go of the couch?
22987	J.D.	I can let go of the couch, if I so choose.
22988	Carla	Okay, let go of the couch. Let go! You see?
22989	J.D.	*There are many things we can't control, no matter how strong we might be. Like a kneejerk reaction.*
22990	Elliot	I'm so sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
22991	Gerst	It's okay.
22992	J.D.	*Or a Janitor who has it in for you.*
22993	Jordan	Hi! Look what someone was nice enough to give me.
22994	Cox	Janitor!
22995	Carla	Thank you, for helping me have some fun tonight.
22996	J.D.	You're welcome. *And sometimes, you let go of the control you do have in a brief moment of weakness.* Sorry. Drunken accident.
22997	Carla	Nothing happened.
22998	J.D.	Right.
22999	Carla	Good night.
23000	J.D.	Good night.
23001	Carla	Good night.
23002	J.D.	Good night.
23003	Carla	Buenas noches.
23004	J.D.	Buenas... those things.
23005	Carla	Good night.
23006	J.D.	*Like she said, everything's fine.**There's nothing like the rays of the morning sun kissing you awake and gently reminding you that you got drunk and kissed your best friend's wife.* Oh my God!
23007	Carla	Oh my God. So it really happened?
23008	J.D.	Yeah, but it was nothing!
23009	Carla	Nothing!
23010	J.D.	No! There wasn't even any tongue!
23011	Carla	No tongue!
23012	J.D.	It was just a friend kiss!
23013	Carla	Were your lips parted at all?
23014	J.D.	No, I pursed them like this.
23015	Carla	I don't know, J.D. I remember my one lip being on top of your upper lip and my other lip being somewhere in the middle of yours, which means your lips were apart and I don't think that's a friend kiss.
23016	J.D.	Yes it is! It's a friend kiss and we will never talk about this to anyone ever!
23017	Elliot	What's going on?
23018	J.D.	Nothing.
23019	Carla	J.D. and I kissed.
23020	J.D.	Carla!
23021	Elliot	You kissed? Like a friend kiss?
23022	J.D.	Yes!
23023	Carla	No!
23024	J.D.	Carla! You're killing me!
23025	Elliot	Why did you close my window?Oh no, she wrote "J.D. and Carla kissed" on the paper and she's going to tell Turk!
23026	Carla	No! Stop her!
23027	J.D.	Don't worry, ladies. I've closed the window.
23028	Elliot	J.D., I don't have a messenger monkey.
23029	Cox	Alright, fine. I'm a little rougher than you are, but guess what? The two of us have two distinctively different parenting styles. You're an overbearing hypercautious psychotic, and I'm... well, you know... fun? And I think if we could meet somewhere in the middle, I think Jack's going to be terrific! And besides, it's not like I ever put him in any real danger.
23030	Jack	Flip.
23031	Jordan	Flip? What does flip mean, Perry?
23032	Cox	Jack probably thinks that Mommy and Daddy are being a little too sarcastic with each other.
23033	Janitor	Maybe. Or, it's because every time he says "Flip" Daddy does a little trick where he grabs Jack by the ankles, he flips him upside down, he drops him down onto his shoulders, and then puts him in a little baby trapeze, shoots him across the sandbox without a net.
23034	Jordan	You are never taking Jack to the park without me. Ever!
23035	Cox	Jordan! A trapeze?
23036	Janitor	Yeah! Photoshop. You can do anything! Here I have you wearing a duck's bill. Get it? Because you're a quack! No? Ha ha ha ha, come on!
23037	Elliot	I'm such a horrible person. I mean, there I was, up on my high horse about Mr. Gerst and then I just turned out to be just as bad as everyone else.
23038	Kelso	Sweetheart, give yourself some credit. You're much worse than everyone else.
23039	Elliot	Maybe I was. But you know what? I'm going to try to better myself, and unlike you, I'm going to follow through, Mr. "Sign up on the Hospital Bulletin Board for Private German Lessons and then Never Show Up"! Yeah, that's right. That was my flyer! I waited at that coffee shop for hours.
23040	Kelso	I broke up with my German mistress. She smelled like sauerkraut.
23041	Elliot	I'm so sorry. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go into that room right now, and own up to what I did.
23042	Gerst	Hello? Did someone come in?
23043	J.D.	I had to hide from Turk, so I went to the one place that I knew no one would ever venture. Ted? Ted?
23044	Ted	A little help!
23045	J.D.	Ted, what are you doing?
23046	Ted	I like to do stomach crunches after lunch.
23047	J.D.	Ted, lunch was four hours ago.
23048	Ted	Yep, I wasted most of my Tuesday.
23049	J.D.	It's Wednesday.
23050	Ted	Aw, man! I missed the Gilmore Girls!
23051	Turk	There you are. Hey Ted. So how'd it go last night?
23052	J.D.	Whoa! What's with the fifth degree?
23053	Turk	Don't you mean third degree?
23054	J.D.	No, because this is two degrees worse. I can't breathe, it's like you're all over me. I'm trapped in a death coffin.
23055	Turk	Calm down, I just want to see if you got anywhere with Carla.
23056	J.D.	*Alright, he knows your lying face, but silence is incriminating too. So think. What's between silence and talking?*
23057	Carla	Turk? I thought you could take me over to Elliot's place to get my stuff so I could move back in.
23058	Turk	Yeah, su Really? Alright, but meet me downstairs, okay?
23059	Carla	Okay.
23060	Turk	I owe you one.
23061	J.D.	Ted, you should probably sit down. You're looking a little purple.
23062	Ted	I know my own body.
23063	J.D.	Thanks for saving my ass.
23064	Carla	Well, I wasn't saving your ass. I didn't realize how easy it is to make little mistakes. They're stupid little mistakes that seem like nothing but can snowball on you and take your whole marriage with it, you know? I feel like I really understand now how Turk could have let stuff like that happen, you know? So I forgave him.
23065	J.D.	I guess I'm glad we kissed then.
23066	Carla	Me too.
23067	Turk	You guys ready?
23068	Carla	Yeah, we are. Let's do it.
23069	Jordan	Okay. We just saw the plastic surgeon. Jack's fine. But if the cut was four inches to the left and seven inches deeper, it could have potentially scratched his eye.
23070	Cox	That was a close one.
23071	Woman	What a sweet little angel! Can I just give him a little squeeze?
23072	Jordan	Of course.
23073	Cox	Back off there, lady. How's about you save up all that energy for the cruise? Go on get out of here. Hippity hop to the barbershop. Come on, Mom. Jordan, this hospital is literally crawling with germs and disease and in all fairness, you don't know if that lady is a sickie or if she was here visiting a sickie and she ran her sickie hands all over her sickie face.
23074	Jordan	I normally never let people touch him.
23075	Janitor	Oh really? Because these photographs would beg to differ. Old lady, kissing Jack. Teenage girl, hugging Jack. Homeless man, holding Jack.
23076	Cox	Jordan!
23077	Jordan	That's just Carl. He holds Jack when I get a bikini wax! What's the matter with me? I mean, I don't think twice about people holding him, and yet I obsess about things like broken arms, broken legs, choking, kidnapping, drowning, silly putty, bad babysitters, pretty babysitters...
23078	Cox	Yeah, I pretty much freak out over staff infections, blood disease, mumps, measles, sex, drugs, rock and roll, and definitely all registered independents. So I think between us we've got everything covered.
23079	Jordan	Was this taken at my mother's house?
23080	Janitor	I gotta go.
23081	Gerst	Dude, that did not happen.
23082	Elliot	Forty-seven... Forty-eight minutes. I'm not sure, I nodded off for a while. Mr. Gerst, I'm so sorry for laughing at you. But I have to tell you a story. When I was in the seventh grade, I was at a roller rink and I needed to go to the bathroom. So I just skated right on into a stall and I did my, uh, private business. And then when I went to pull up my pants, I started rolling towards the door, which as it turned out wasn't latched. Now, I don't know if you've had any experience roller skating with your underpants around your ankles it's very difficult to stop. Unless of course, you know, you scream so loud that they turn off the music and everyone is looking at you. Anyway, that's how I wound up with the nickname "Roller Moler".
23083	Gerst	I'm sorry?
23084	Elliot	I have a mole on my ass.
23085	Gerst	Why are you telling me this?
23086	Elliot	Because I owned up to it. This is funny, Mr. Gerst. And if you don't just embrace it and become part of the joke then it will follow you around and devour you.
23087	Gerst	Can I get a look at that mole?
23088	Elliot	No. Ahem. No.
23089	J.D.	This is nice. The three of us sitting together again like the Three Musketeers.
23090	Carla	Yeah! And I need you guys to scrape your plates before you put them in the dishwasher!
23091	Turk	She's back! My baby's back!
23092	J.D.	*Carla was right. If a relationship is going to work, it has to be based on trust. Like a wife trusting her husband again.*
23093	Dad	Hey. Kid's back on the jungle gym. Guess your wife backed down.
23094	Cox	You bet your sweet ass she did.
23095	J.D.	*Even if it involves a compromise.*
23096	Cox	Hey Jack! Just blink when you want me to get you down. Just give me the old blink-a-rooney. Terrific athlete. I'm thinking 2016 Olympics. Oh God, was that a blink? Excuse me.
23097	J.D.	*Or a patient trusting his doctor to help him hold on to his dignity.*
23098	Gerst	Yeah! And then I pulled off Grandma's breathing apparatus. No, I'm serious!
23099	J.D.	*It may take a lot of work, but it's worth it.*Wow, that was a moist kiss. Wish I was wearing an apron.
23100	Turk	Baby, from here on out I hide nothing from you. It's a clean start for us. Sports time!
23101	J.D.	*Because in the end, things work out for the best.*
23102	Carla	J.D. and I kissed.
23103	J.D.	*Or not.*
23104	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23105	J.D.'s Narration	Let me explain, Turk & Carla's marriage was in trouble because of some dumb stuff Turk had done. So last night I took Carla out to smooth things over.Long story short, we smooched.
23106	J.D.	Sorry, drunken accident.
23107	J.D.'s Narration	It was barely more than a friend kiss, so we decided not to tell Turk... or so I thought.
23108	Carla	J.D. & I kissed.
23109	J.D.'s Narration	Was it a comfortable silence? No. And I'm going to be the one who breaks it. Unfortunately I have one of Rowdy's hairs in my mouth... uh-oh!I guess there's a lot of things that can knock you on your ass...
23110	J.D.'s Narration continues	Like, for instance, when your 17-year-old neighbour doesn't see you as a smoking hottie anymore...
23111	Jordan	Oh, Pedro I can't seem to find my pencil. Do you have any idea where it might be?
23112	Pedro	Oh it's right there between your bosoms, ma'am.
23113	Jordan	Ma'am??? You just ma'amed your way out of me ever buying you beer again!Ma'am?
23114	J.D.'s Narration continues	And of course, the one thing you can always count on to knock you on your ass...
23115	Dr. Kelso	AARRGGHH!
23116	J.D.'s Narration continues	Floor Wax.
23117	Janitor	Uncanny. Dr. Kelso, while I got you here, I need to discuss a hospital matter of grave importance.
23118	Dr. Kelso	What is it?
23119	Janitor	I'm not happy with my uniform.
23120	Dr. Kelso	Ahh new Janitor uniforms, top priority. Right up there with silk jammies for the patients and a cat door for the ICU.
23121	Janitor	I made some sketches.
23122	Dr. Kelso	This one has a cape!
23123	Janitor	That gives me the option of fighting crime.After work, of course. Now this one, got sort of a medieval thing going.
23124	Dr. Kelso	Is he on a horse?
23125	Janitor	It's his steed, sir.That's for clean-ups in outer space. This one's outer space, evening wear. This one's just a kangaroo... sometimes I draw kangaroos.
23126	Dr. Kelso	You know I could look at the demented crayon scratchings of a madman all day, but I got a hospital to run. Did you wax over there yet?
23127	Janitor	No sir.I'll get a new uniform or I'll wax everything in your WORLD!
23128	Dr. Cox	Oh hey there wait 'til you get a load of this, they're giving me a teaching award tonight so I'm gonna need you to go ahead and holster up 'the twins' as you'll be playing the role of "arm-candy".
23129	Jordan	Yeah, I'm not going. If I wanna hear someone go on & on about how great you are, I'll just listen to you during sex.
23130	Dr. Cox	I'm hearing the hate but I'm not seeing the hate. You...Oh my God! Did you Botox you face into an expressionless mask?
23131	Jordan	Pedro called me ma'am.
23132	Dr. Cox	Ah damn it Jordan, come on. Now you know I'm generally OK with you putting any poison you want into your body, but this is the first time I've ever won anything!
23133	Jordan	It's not that bad.
23134	Dr. Cox	Reeeaaaly? Show me happy...Sad...Silly...Amused, bemused, c-mused...Show me angry.AARRGGHH!!Got angry down.
23135	J.D.'s Narration	When we got to work, not a whole lot had changed. The silence was killing me...
23136	Turk	You kissed my wife.
23137	J.D.'s Narration continues	I miss the silence.
23138	Turk	Did you like it?
23139	J.D.	Well that's kind of a trick question, Turk. I mean if I say yes, it's like I'm saying "damn dude, your wife is hot & I'd like to get me some of that". But if I say no then I'm all like "yo, I know she's your wife but you can keep that fish-lipped bitty".
23140	Turk	What about you Carla, did you like it?
23141	Carla	NO! His lips are chappy.
23142	J.D.	I can't use lip-balm; I always end up eating it. When I was little I used to spread it on crackers.
23143	Elliot	Ah, well if it isn't the happy couple. Oh and Turk's here too.Ooo-K are we not laughing about this yet?
23144	Carla	Turk, look, I'm so sorry but you have to believe me. It was barely anything.
23145	J.D.	It was barely even a kiss dude; it was like an accidental lip bump, like oops.
23146	Turk	WHOOAAA! Don't even look at her. Sit on the floor.
23147	J.D.	Sitting .
23148	Carla	Fine, I'll show you with Elliot.
23149	Todd	Something wonderful is happening.
23150	Elliot	I don't understand why you're butting in on my patients, you know outside of your usual arrogance & God complex.
23151	Dr. Cox	I don't know what you're talking about. Kiss my ring.However, if you'd like to know about why I'm butting in, it's because your young patient Lindsay here, when she was 10 years old, I'm the one who diagnosed her with epilepsy and now that her medication is no longer controlling her seizures, I'd like to know what's going on. Besides, over the years, Lindsay and I have developed quite a rapport.Hey Lindsay, what's up girlfriend?See, rapport.
23152	Dr. Kelso	That damned Janitor waxed the counter. Gimme that phone.
23153	Janitor	It doesn't have to be like this.
23154	Dr. Kelso	I know, here.
23155	Janitor	It's beautiful.
23156	Dr. Kelso	Now you don't have to put it on today, but...
23157	J.D.	Hey we're kind of in the middle of something here!
23158	Janitor	This'll just take a second.Nice, huh?
23159	J.D.	Who gets a tattoo of a mop? Can I get up, my butt is asleep.
23160	Turk	NO!
23161	Carla	Turk, you know how I was so upset because you started calling your ex-girlfriend? I just couldn't understand how a married person could slip up like that, now I do. I'm so sorry.
23162	J.D.	Me too buddy.
23163	Turk	Guys, as insane as this may sound I'm actually gonna be OK with this. Just do me a favor, no more apologies and no more explanations and for the love of God, honey, no more girl-on-girl kissing demonstrations.
23164	Todd	Something horrible has happened.
23165	Elliot	Tell you why Lindsay's seizures are back, her blood work shows her Dilantin is at zero. She's not been taking her medicine.
23166	Dr. Cox	What!?! I'm gonna give that girl a serious talking to.
23167	Elliot	With all due respect, Dr. Cox, maybe I should talk to her.
23168	Dr. Cox	With no due respect whatsoever, why?
23169	Elliot	Well she's a teenage girl, that's an awkward time. You know, your breasts are growing... not always symmetrically. Um, you like boys. Maybe one gives you a ride home, you think something's gonna happen but it doesn't and that just makes it official that you're a lop-sided freak. Happy ending though; lefty caught up in college, ha, ha.
23170	Dr. Cox	Barbie! I have a finite amount of brain space and your inspiring story of the little breast who couldn't just pushed out my memory of the 1980 Olympic Hockey team's victory at Lake Placid. Miracle on Ice... gone!Listen to me carefully, I know all about what it's like to be a teenage girl, wah wah wah. Course, I never had to try to convince my mother that I sure would have liked a navel ring.
23171	Elliot	Oh well we were all going to Jamaica and my friend Susan...
23172	Dr. Cox	Brain space.
23173	Carla	Turk, you've been so awesome but we still need you to know how innocent that kiss was.
23174	Turk	Guys, it's cool, don't even worry about it.
23175	J.D.	Just watch buddy.
23176	Carla	See?
23177	Turk	Argh! Get your hands off my woman!
23178	Jordan	Owwww! I think you separated my shoulder, the pain is excruciating.
23179	Turk	What?
23180	Nurse	Looking good Janitor.
23181	Janitor	Well thank you, petite-lady.
23182	Todd	Wow, that colour really brings out your package.
23183	Janitor	Thank you, supposedly-straight-surgeon. It's a good day.
23184	Ted	Hey buddy, that's a great suit.
23185	Janitor	Don't punch the new uni.
23186	Ted	Ha, ha, ha, little boy blue, blow your horn.
23187	Janitor	He didn't stop. Stop! This hallway is closed; you have to find another way around.
23188	J.D.	Whatever. You got something here though.
23189	Janitor	What's that?
23190	J.D.	Well I don't know, you just look so cute in your little blue outfit; I wanted to give you a tickle.
23191	Janitor	Alright, what the hell is going on?
23192	Dr. Cox	Feel free to take notes. Alright there Blossom, here's the hot gossip. You're having seizures again because you're not taking your medication. If this continues, you will be dead... and I'm not talking about the "oh my God, if I don't get invited to the prom I'm going to die" type of dead I'm talking, dead dead. Is that clear enough for you? Because if it's not I could of course text you on my Blackberry, or my Blueberry or my Chuck Berry, although technically Chuck Berry is a black berry. The point is you gotta to stop wasting everybody's time and grow up, is that clear to you sweetheart?
23193	Lindsay	Yes doctor Cox.
23194	Dr. Cox	Atta girl.Barbie! Feel free to kiss my ring.
23195	J.D.'s Narration	It's nice when things get back to normal.
23196	Carla	Hey guys.
23197	J.D. & Turk	Hey.
23198	J.D.	Carla, you gotta try these sweet potato fries, they're amazing!
23199	Carla	Put some ketchup on it.
23200	J.D.	You got it.
23201	Turk	AAAHHHHHHH!!!
23202	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23203	J.D.'s Narration	Like I said before, small things can knock you on your ass...
23204	J.D.'s Narration continues	Whether it's realizing that no-one's afraid of you anymore...
23205	Janitor	Good lord!
23206	J.D.'s Narration continues	Or finding out that you have no idea how to deal with a teenage girl...
23207	Elliot	Nice work.
23208	J.D.'s Narration continues	The important thing is to not make a scene in the cafeteria.
23209	J.D.	Want another one?AARRGGHH!
23210	Carla	Turk!
23211	Turk	What? What! Were you gonna eat that? How about this, let's all have fries, huh, let's all have fries! You want fries!?!
23212	Carla	Turk, you said you were OK!
23213	J.D.	My fries!
23214	Turk	Well apparently I'm not OK, am I Carla? Apparently I'm not! You know why? Because kisses just don't happen, they don't! Now this is somebody's fault and I wanna know who's? HUH!Don't eat that fry!I may have lost my cool here.
23215	Carla	No.
23216	J.D.	No Turk, it's understandable.
23217	Turk	I'm sorry. The only way I'm gonna have closure here is if I can blame one of you guys. I just gotta figure out who.
23218	J.D.	Don't worry, this'll all be fine. You know Turk, I mean, whomever he blames will get the silent treatment for a couple of days, then he'll make snarky comments for a few months and then, sooner or later, he'll be laughing about the whole thing. It's just like the time I slept with his family's cleaning lady.
23219	Carla	You slept with Tuni?
23220	J.D.	I was staying in their guest-room & she was buffing the nightstand and she just kept on buffing. But hey, thanks for taking the hit on this one.
23221	Carla	Me? Na-a na-a, you're his best friend, all you have to do is say "I'm sorry", high-five him & go "DAAAAHHHHH!"
23222	J.D.	Oh but all you have to do is have sex with him & he'll forgive you. If I have sex with him he'll probably end up madder.
23223	Carla	You know what; let's not play into his blame game.
23224	J.D.	Agreed.Dude she was pouring drinks into me & she knows I put out when I'm drunk.
23225	Carla	He took me to a bar.
23226	J.D.	DAAAAHHHHH!
23227	Carla	I didn't ask him to walk me home.
23228	J.D.	I'm telling you dude, she was all over me. Like ants on candy.
23229	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23230	Carla	You think you're talking to Turk, don't you?Idiot.
23231	Dr. Cox	Look Lindsay, I'm real sorry if I upset you before, I truly am. I probably should have asked you why you stopped taking your medication and to be honest with you I was, I was hoping you'd be able to give me the answer to that one right about now.
23232	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23233	Dr. Cox	Sooooo Linz-o, ha h-it must be kind of cool having the same name as that Lindsay Lohan. Gosh, she's super-cool. Just between you, me and the I.V. I guess I've probably seen "Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen" oh, I don't know, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8-9 times ha h- what a film. Whew!That girl, that girl is a robot. I spent 3 hours in there and got goose-egg.
23234	Elliot	That's so odd that she didn't respond to you, because you know sooooo much about teenage girls.
23235	Dr. Cox	Alright, look, Barbie I'm about to say 4 words that I've never said to you before, that I'll never say again.Go on, get out of here!I need your help.
23236	Elliot	Fine, but I have 3 rules. One, when we're in the room you say nothing. Two, I get to say whatever I want about you. And three, if you break rule 1 or 2, I get to boing your curls.
23237	Dr. Cox	What the hell does "boing" mean?
23238	Elliot	Boinnng!
23239	Dr. Cox	Oh God this is gonna kill me.
23240	Janitor's Thoughts	Alright, just put on your mean face and order shall be restored.
23241	Janitor	Yeah hi, nut!What? I don't even know you.Yeah, yeah, happy birthday.You gave me a cursed uniform!
23242	Dr. Kelso	Ha, ha, ha, it's not cursed, its simple psychology. I chose Robin's-Egg blue because it has a calming effect on people & I knew it would be the thorn in your paw. Other colours evoke different reactions, for example bright orange has been found to provoke hostility.
23243	Ted	Doctor Kelso, I wanna thank you again for the tie.
23244	Todd	Fist Five!
23245	Ted	OWW! It's the third time today.
23246	Jordan	Aw, please don't make me go to this banquet tonight.
23247	Dr. Cox	Jordan, this award came from my interns. So the least you can do is show up & support me.
23248	J.D.'s Narration	And just like that it was time for the moment of truth...
23249	J.D. & Carla	Hey Turk!
23250	Turk	'Sup J.D.
23251	Carla	The silent treatment.
23252	J.D.'s Narration	Be gracious.
23253	J.D.	I got 3 words for you; sucks to be, adding a fourth, you .
23254	J.D.'s Narration	After sharing a quick victory dance with Roland, the heavy-set orderly who, coincidentally, was my victory dance coach...
23255	Roland	Pop the hips, pop the hips J.D.
23256	J.D.	OK, there it is. Thanks Roland, one day I'll get it.
23257	Roland	I doubt it.
23258	J.D.'s Narration continues	I got to thinking about relationships, about how people fall in love...Have kids...Grow old together...And say goodbye...And then for some reason I thought about the circus... but then I was back on relationships...
23259	J.D.	Back to your room Mr. Johnson, you've got one ventricle!
23260	J.D.'s Narration continues	And I couldn't help thinking that maybe it wasn't luck that made relationships last. Maybe it was just a matter of who takes fewer hits...
23261	Carla	You don't have to talk to me, just wave if you're gonna give me a ride home.
23262	J.D.'s Narration continues	And I realized I should have been the one to take that hit, not Carla.
23263	Elliot	Hey Lindsay.Oh, don't worry. He's not allowed to talk.
23264	Lindsay	Is that true?
23265	Elliot	You may nod.Ah, ah. Bup, bup.You know Lindsay when I was 15 I cut my own bangs. Oh that's right Percival; it's a high-school hair story.Anyway, Judy Keenan told me that she would also cut her hair off; it was like a suicide-pact, only with bangs. I cut off my hair and, of course, she backed out. But even though my bangs looked horrible, I kept them that way. Mostly because those stupid bangs were the only thing in my life that I felt I had control over, you know?
23266	Lindsay	I'm so tired of everyone telling me what to do; when to be home, what to wear, when to take my medicine. I mean, I'm the one who's sick, right? I can handle my own life.
23267	Elliot	How 'bout I tell your parents that from now on the prescriptions for your medicine will be given directly to you? You'll be in charge of getting your Dilantin, taking it, everything.
23268	Lindsay	Thank you.
23269	Elliot	Great.I don't have a ring, but you can kiss my ass.
23270	Janitor	Feared in grey? Beautiful in blue? Feared in grey? Beautiful in blue?
23271	Ted	I'm gonna grab a fry, some ketchup. Ah, it's cold.
23272	Janitor	That's it.I'm back!
23273	Turk	That was weird, ha, ha.
23274	Todd	No, that was weird.
23275	Turk	What are you doing?!
23276	J.D.	That was all it was! And if you still need someone to blame, why don't you try blaming yourself?
23277	Turk	You're absolutely right. It's my fault you kissed my wife.HI-YAH!
23278	Ted	Aw man, I'm going home.
23279	J.D.	Dude, who do you think you're talking to, you think you've been the World's greatest husband? Please, I was there when you were flirting with your ex-girlfriend & neglected to tell her you were married. I was there when you tried to hook up with that waitress, the day before you got engaged. And I was definitely there when you hooked up with that nasty ass stripper at "Boobies, Boobies, Boobies".
23280	Turk	That wasn't me that was you!
23281	J.D.	I know but I told her my name was Turk. Look the point is, think of the millions of times you chose to not to hang out with your wife, 'cause you were trying to hang out with me. You know, maybe it's time you started acting like a real husband, instead of acting like some sort of crazy... cowboy.
23282	Turk	A cowboy?
23283	J.D.	I don't know, it just came to me.You know I'm right Turk.
23284	J.D.'s Narration	When your pride's at stake, you can't help but have questions...
23285	Dr. Cox	Just tell me, how did you know what was bothering her? Tell me now so that we don't have to talk anymore, ever.
23286	Elliot	How is it that no man understands that every woman, whether she's 16 or 60, still has that awkward, insecure, self-conscious teenage girl inside of her?
23287	J.D.'s Narration continues	A lot of times, the answer is about sacrifice...
23288	Dr. Cox	Hey!Look here, I was thinking maybe, maybe you'd rather just stay in tonight. You know have some pizza watch, watch some movies, what do you say?Are you trying to smile?You're so damned cute.
23289	J.D.'s Narration continues	Sometimes sacrifice is only wearing your new uni when you're not at work...
23290	Janitor	OK how about this one? Three blue-jays fly into a bar & they say, "we just want to wet out beaks". Ha, ha, ha... no? Sorry Dan, you tell one.
23291	J.D.'s Narration continues	Other times, it's about swallowing that damn pride...
23292	Carla	J.D., would you hand me the wine please? Turk's not talking to me.
23293	J.D.'s Narration continues	But ultimately, big or small, sacrifice is about doing something you don't really wanna do.
23294	J.D.	Hey guys, I know we talked about this before but, I'm moving out.
23295	Carla	Really?
23296	J.D.	Man, you guys need your space.
23297	Turk	Wow, thanks man.
23298	J.D.	You're gonna miss me though.
23299	Elliot	Hey, you could turn his room into a gym.
23300	Turk	We ain't putting no gym in my media room.
23301	Carla	Who's media room?
23302	Turk	Our media room.
23303	Carla	Yeah
23304	Turk & Carla	Yeah!
23305	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23306	J.D.'s Narration	One of the reasons Turk and I are so popular around here is that we love helping our fellow doctors.
23307	J.D.	Hey, Hooch!
23308	Hooch	That's my name....don't wear it out.
23309	J.D.	Classic Hooch! Listen, even though I'm not gonna be paid, I'm gonna cover your shift at the clinic tonight so you can do Mr. Schindler's endoscopy.
23310	Turk	And I'm gonna cross-cover all of Dr. Turner's patients so Turner can assist you on the procedure.
23311	Hooch	Why you guys going through so much trouble?
23312	Dr. Kelso	Who's doing the endoscopy on Mr. Schindler?
23313	J.D.	Were you doing Hooch?
23314	Turk	Yeah!
23315	Hooch	Everyone hates you guys.
23316	J.D.	Oh, Hooch!
23317	Turk	Hooch is crazy!
23318	J.D.'s Narration	As much as Hooch loved us, it was even better to see Turk happy. See, he and Carla had recently started couples therapy, and I'm not sure he was enjoying it.
23319	Therapist	Carla says you cry after you orgasm. Would you like to talk about that?
23320	Turk	No, not really.
23321	J.D.'s Narration	I decided to help their marriage by moving out. Partly because Carla and I had accidentally kissed and messed things up, but mostly because it was time. Still, finding an apartment has not been easy.
23322	J.D.	I'm so sorry about your father. I'm sure he lived a wonderful life at... 14 Maple Drive, Apartment 4B. Was he lucky enough to enjoy a washer and dryer in his unit while he was alive?Ever mention any hot neighbors?What are you doing in the on-call room?
23323	Turk	Nothing.
23324	Carla	I gotta go.
23325	Turk	Okay.
23326	J.D.'s Narration	Thankfully, Turk had gotten over the whole kissing incident. Still, there's a weird new thing he does whenever he says goodbye.
23327	Turk	Okay, I'll see you around.
23328	J.D.	Agh! ...Peace, homey!
23329	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23330	Elliot	Uh, do you guys think that Clarissa is more attractive than me?
23331	Dr. Cox	Yes.Who's Clarissa?
23332	Elliot	She's the short, balding woman in the pharmacy.
23333	Dr. Cox	Oh, then definitely yes.
23334	Elliot	She just got engaged. Bad comb-over and all!
23335	Carla	When Clarissa beats you to the altar, it might be time to hang up the ovaries.
23336	Elliot	Too mean!
23337	Carla	Are the guys here really that bad?
23338	Ted	Twelve minutes door-to-door! That's a personal best, sucko! Agh!
23339	Todd	Nurse, suction.
23340	Nurse	The patient's not even here yet.
23341	Todd	I know.
23342	Elliot	I just wish once a cute, thoughtful guy would walk through the door.
23343	Jake	Hi. I need some help. My neighbor fainted and she doesn't like ambulances, so I brought her in myself.
23344	Elliot	Let me take this one, Jenny, you've got a phone call.
23345	Jenny	Uh, I'll call them back.
23346	Elliot	Your mom died.
23347	Jenny	WHAT?!
23348	Elliot	Her mom's fine. It's just a little running joke we have. She'll be laughing later. Got you, Jenny!Dead mom jokes always funny. Heh.
23349	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23350	J.D.	So, Betty, you're back with us. And I see you brought a young, handsome buck with ya. What are you, trying to make me jealous? You know you're my gal!
23351	Betty	Who are you?
23352	J.D.	I'm Dr. Dorian. Uh, I'm the one that's taken care of you the last nineteen times you've been in here. She's getting a little forgetful you know how that happens. Are you a relative?
23353	Jake	Uh, no, neighbor. I only met her once.
23354	Betty	It was raining, and you were wearing a blue sweater!
23355	J.D.	That's a lovely memory, Betty. You know what else is a lovely memory that Sunday I spent eight hours helping you join the Wilford Brimley fan club. You don't remember that, do ya.
23356	Jake	If everything's all right here, I'm kind of on my way to the airport. I'm going kayaking with some friends in New Zealand.
23357	Elliot	Cool! So, what are you gonna do there?
23358	Jake	Mostly kayaking.
23359	Elliot	Ohhh.
23360	Jake	So, uh, Betty, I'll check on you the second I get back, okay? You get better, now!
23361	J.D.	So Elliot, the first thing we're gonna need to do is....
23362	Betty	Is Dr. Reid coming back?
23363	J.D.	Oh, don't worry about her, Betty, you're in good hands with Dr. Dorian.
23364	Betty	Who's that?
23365	J.D.	That's me! Betty, Dr. Dorian. 'Cocoon'. Wilford Brimley. Steve Guttenberg. The whole day. No?
23366	Elliot	Hey, Jake. Heh. So, uh, you're probably rushing home to wipe the old person smell off before your trip, huh?
23367	Jake	Excuse me?
23368	Elliot	No , I'm just kidding. I love old people. Still, there's no denying they have a distinctive smell. I mean, it's nothing bad, it's like a...general mustiness.... Like, you know, when you get your cast taken off and...skin mold....
23369	Jake	Well, I got a flight to catch. You guys need me to sign anything?
23370	Dr. Cox	Nah.
23371	Carla	No, you're good.
23372	Jake	Okay, then.
23373	Dr. Cox	Hat's off, there, Barbie. That was one potent combination of verbal diarrhea and stunned silence.
23374	Carla	You should've just asked him out men love that.
23375	Dr. Cox	No, Carla, men don't love that. It turns out we don't love picnics, foreplay, candles, baths, photo albums, or when you drive so that we can relax, and as always we're not that big on Hugh Jackman. Lookit, the only thing men actually care about as far as dating is concerned is The Chase. If you want that guy to look your way, listen to me carefully, ignore the living hell out of him.
23376	Carla	That's the worst advice I've ever heard!
23377	Dr. Cox	Good point, Carla. Say, you don't happen to have any other gems you wanna lay on us before you run off to couples therapy to sift through the wreckage that is the first year of your marriage, do ya?
23378	Elliot	Look, Dr. Cox, I'm sure that you are fantastic at picking up men, reallybut I can handle this one on my own, thank you.Ow! Some people just cannot take a good "your mom's dead" joke, you know?
23379	Dr. Cox	Ah.
23380	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23381	Carla	Anyway, I worry that sometimes when I'm tense, I could be a little condescending.
23382	Therapist	Actually, I've noticed that.
23383	Carla	Have you really noticed it, Mr. Therapist?
23384	Therapist	Chris. What's going on with you?
23385	Turk	Nothing worth talking about.
23386	Therapist	This is your third visit, and you've yet to say anything real about how you're feeling.
23387	Turk	That's because I don't think there's anything wrong with our relationship.
23388	Therapist	I think you pretend that everything's okay even though, deep down inside, a lot of things are bothering you. So, come on, tell me what you're thinking right now.
23389	Turk	I'm staring at that picture above your head. Yeah, now, is that one of those psychological ink-blot tests where I try and figure out what it is? Because if so, I'm seeing a duck.
23390	Therapist	Let's take a break.
23391	Carla	Yeah.
23392	Turk	Okay.
23393	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23394	Dr. Turner	But Hooch, if the patient just has simple cellulitis, why aren't the antibiotics working?
23395	Hooch	Dammit, Turner! It just doesn't make sense!
23396	J.D.'s Narration	Even though I had created a super medical crime-fighting team, I felt lousy. See, I had just told Betty that her lungs had finally given out and she wasn't gonna leave the hospital this time.
23397	Betty	So...what are my choices?
23398	J.D.	Well, we could put you on a breathing machine, but it's unlikely you'd ever come off of it. Or I could just make sure you're as comfortable as possible.
23399	J.D.'s Thoughts	"As comfortable as possible." I've said that a million times and I still have no idea what it means.
23400	J.D.	There you go, Betty! That's every cotton ball in the hospital!
23401	Betty	Ohhh! I am very, very comfortable!
23402	J.D.	Then you're ready to die.Look, Betty, is there anyone you'd like to talk this over with?She just wants to talk to you for a minute.
23403	Jake	Yeah? About what?
23404	J.D.	Just about how and when she should die.
23405	Jake	Oh, that's not a problem. I counsel most of my random neighbors on their deathbeds.
23406	J.D.	Look, this woman is alone, she's depressed, and for some reason she feels like she's connected with you.
23407	Jake	Look, I'm sorry, but I wouldn't know what to say.
23408	J.D.	That's great! Keep it light! Open with a joke, and before you know it you and your raft will be on a four-hour trip to New Zealand!
23409	Jake	No, it's more like fourteen hours.
23410	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh no. You're dangerously close to revealing that geography is your Achilles heel. Say something smart to regain credibility.
23411	J.D.	Vasovagal syncope is mediated by the autonomic nervous system. And Betty needs you, pal. She does! Come on, do it. You'll feel good, trust me.
23412	Jake	Trust you? You don't even know where New Zealand is.
23413	J.D.	You can dance your way there from Old Zealand.
23414	Jake	You an idiot?
23415	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23416	Janitor	Elliot. My neighbor fainted too! Hey, you wanna go clubbing tonight? And I don't mean dancing I mean going up to the roof and killing rats.
23417	Elliot	Janitor. I thought we were done with this?
23418	Janitor	I know. Thought I'd give it a shot.
23419	Elliot	Ugh. Just...put her back in her room.
23420	Janitor	She's not a patient. I got her at the mall!
23421	Elliot's Thoughts	Oh my God, here he comes. Okay, this is easy, just compliment him tell him he has a square head. That's not a compliment! What shape is a compliment? Triangle? Uh, pyramid? Circle! Circle head! Oh my God, you're stuck on shapes and Square-Head's almost here! To hell with it, just do what Dr. Cox said and ignore him.
23422	Jake	Hey, Elliot.
23423	Elliot	Mm.
23424	Jake	So that girl's kinda cute, what's her story?
23425	J.D.	She's a dude.
23426	Jake	Nuh-uh.
23427	J.D.	Gotta look at the Adam's apple, buddy.
23428	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23429	Turk	Couples therapy is killing me.
23430	Todd	I don't know how you do it make love with your lady in front of some old dude who's filming you?
23431	Turk	That's not couples therapy, Todd.
23432	Todd	Then what did I do?
23433	Turk	You did amateur porn!
23434	Todd	Sweet!
23435	Turk	J.D., you got a sec?
23436	J.D.	Sure.
23437	Jake	Okay.
23438	Turk	So check this out: Our therapist says I'm the type of guy who pretends everything's okay even when I'm upset deep down inside.
23439	J.D.	Well, I think that's true. I mean, if you look at the whole Carla kissing thing, I think intellectually you moved on, but emotionally you're still upset. You'll get there, though, pal.
23440	Turk	I'm not upset!
23441	J.D.	Really? Oh, okay. I'll see you later. Bye.Ow! You see!
23442	Turk	See what?
23443	J.D.	Let's try it again. I'll see you later, buddy. Bye!
23444	Turk	Bye.
23445	J.D.	OW! Always the same spot! It's like your fingers are stone!
23446	Last time	I'll see you later. Buh Hey! Look at yourself!
23447	Turk	I've been hitting you.
23448	J.D.	Yeah, you're like the brown Hulk.Hey. How's it going in here, you two?
23449	Jake	Oh, pretty good. Pretty good. We, uh, we talked about her past. Betty even let me in on a few of her romantic trysts from her younger days you familiar with Mr. David Brinkley?
23450	J.D.	No way!
23451	Jake	Yeah.
23452	Betty	Betty!
23453	Jake	And when we finally got down to talking for real, well, it became pretty obvious that...Betty had already made a decision.
23454	J.D.	Okay.
23455	Narration	The thing that impressed me most about Jake besides his perfectly square head was that he faced this whole Betty thing straight on.
23456	Elliot	He thinks I'm cute. He thinks I'm cah-yute. He thinks I'm cute, he thinks I'm cute, he thinks I'm cute...
23457	J.D.'s Narration	...He didn't hide because he was afraid to admit someone was right...
23458	Elliot	...I'm cute.
23459	Dr. Cox	Barbie? Why so happy?
23460	Elliot	No reason.
23461	J.D.'s Narration	...He didn't run because he was scared of facing his own feelings...
23462	Turk	Baby, I'm not gonna be able to make therapy tonight. I got surgery.
23463	Carla	Fine.
23464	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, he wouldn't've been able to do it if it weren't for his secret weapon...
23465	J.D.	Dr. John Dorian.
23466	Jake	What?
23467	J.D.	Wha?
23468	Jake	You just said your name in a weird kinda summing-up way.
23469	J.D.	No I didn't, Jake.
23470	Dennis	Ah, so you're Jake! Uh, as I understand it, you just talked my sister into ending her life. Long story short: I'm a lawyer, I'm suing you. Once again: Sister dying, brother lawyer, suing you!
23471	J.D.	See, that's summing up in a weird way.
23472	Jake	Yeah.
23473	J.D.	"Brother lawyer." That's it.
23474	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23475	Jake	I can't believe this is happening.
23476	J.D.	Everything's gonna be fine, you just trust me.
23477	Ted	Is that him?
23478	J.D.	Yes. Here's Ted, our brilliant hospital attorney. Sharp as a tack.
23479	Ted	Mark my words, Jake! We're gonna take every last cent you have!
23480	J.D.	No, no, Ted, we're on his side.
23481	Ted	Oh. Here's my card.
23482	Jake	This is a post-it.
23483	Ted	I don't get real cards until I win a case.
23484	J.D.	Go take a nap, Ted.
23485	Jake	He spelled "attorney" wrong.
23486	J.D.	"Buy Groceries. Kill Self."
23487	Jake	Just admit it you're just here from the future to destroy me.
23488	J.D.	I am not from the future, Jake!Yes! It finally worked! What are the odds?
23489	Jake	I don't know what the odds are, J.D., but what I do know is I'm about to go down to my truck, get my kayak paddle, and go Greg Barton on your ass.
23490	J.D.	Who's Greg Barton?
23491	Jake	He's a famous kayaker.
23492	J.D.	Oh, Greg Barton!
23493	Jake	I hate you, J.D.
23494	J.D.	I know.
23495	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23496	Elliot	Dr. Cox, this is the most painful thing I've ever done, and I was a cutter for a week in high school my shop teacher thought scars were sexy, but that is a whole other story. The point is your advice really worked with Jake, and I'd really appreciate it if you'd give me some more help.
23497	Dr. Cox	Oh, no problem Barbie. Let me just finish writing this, uh, prescription. You'll be all squared away.
23498	Elliot	This a prescription for "no."
23499	Dr. Cox	Correctomundo. It's to be taken with food every Saturday night while you're eating alone.
23500	Elliot	I don't think you understand the severity of the situation here! I am dangerously close to giving up men altogether!
23501	Dr. Cox	And on behalf of men everywhere and I do mean everywhere, including the ones in the little mud huts let me be the first to say thanks and alleluia!
23502	Carla	Elliot, do you see the problem with trying to appeal to its human side?
23503	Elliot	He doesn't have one.
23504	Carla	Exactly! But what does he have?
23505	Elliot	A shaved chest, a closetful of tiny tee shirts, and the eyes of a madman.
23506	Dr. Cox	OHHHH! I'm sorry! The correct answer she was looking for is "a giant ego"! I have a giant ego!
23507	Elliot	Dammit! I knew that!
23508	Carla	Would you just appeal to it so I can go get something to eat?
23509	Elliot	You're...amazing.
23510	Dr. Cox	And I'm in!
23511	Elliot	Oh! Ah!
23512	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23513	J.D.	Dr. Kelso, you can't do that.
23514	Dr. Kelso	I didn't. Your friend Turkleton did. And I can do whatever I want. You look ridiculous.
23515	Turk	I thought we were doing mustaches on Sunday?
23516	J.D.	I didn't do this, Kelso did!
23517	Turk	You invited Kelso to Mustache Sunday?
23518	J.D.	Enough with the mustaches, dude! Are you responsible for breaking up Turner and Hooch?
23519	Turk	I need an excuse to get out of couples counseling. Dude, I can't open up, man, I just can't do it. Besides, this way no one gets hurt.
23520	Dr. Turner	We had a hell of a run, man.
23521	Hooch	Just get outta here.
23522	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23523	Jake	Well, maybe I should just go talk to him.
23524	J.D.	Forget Dennis, he's a horrible person, okay? We'll never be able to change his mind. We need to focus on Betty, okay? We'll just have her explain how she feels, problem solved. Betty's in a coma. You know what? I'm gonna talk to Dennis he seems like a reasonable guy.
23525	Elliot	Hey, Jake. How's it goin'?
23526	Jake	Oh, heh, I've had better days. How are you?
23527	Dr. Cox	Listen to me, Barbacious, you gotta stay the course here. You gotta keep ignoring him.
23528	Elliot	But I am already ignoring him. How do I ignore him more?
23529	Dr. Cox	Aha. Piece of cake. First you engage him, then you ignore him.
23530	Jake	Elliot? I said, How are you?
23531	Elliot	I actually don't have time for this, okay? I'm a doctor!
23532	Jake	But you asked me how I was.
23533	Elliot	Yeah, trying to save lives here. It's not always about you!
23534	Jake	Buddy, you would not believe the day I'm having.
23535	Janitor	Quiet, jackass. What'd you say to Elliot to make her run off like that? 'Cause if you hurt her....
23536	Jake	I didn't say anything! Everyone around here is crazy.
23537	Janitor	That's not true. Let me put down my bag of rats and explain something to you....
23538	Jake	Bag of rats? Those alive?
23539	Janitor	Most of 'em are. I put a dead one in the middle, that way all the live ones get a good look at him, they start toeing that line. Know what I'm saying?
23540	Jake	I very much don't.
23541	Janitor	Pretty simple. Take a canvas bag....Jailbreak!
23542	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23543	J.D.	Look, you're gonna do whatever you want with your sister, but Jake's just trying to help. He's a stand-up guy, I think you should leave him alone. If you do, I think it would be dy-no-mite! Sorry, I was just watching 'Good Times' in the doctors' lounge.
23544	Dennis	Yeah. I'm gonna screw him to the wall.
23545	J.D.	Can you believe this guy?
23546	Dr. Kelso	Son, look around. There's an old man with Alzheimer's who no one bothers to come visit. This morning I had a chat with a woman who refuses to stop using cocaine even though she's six months pregnant. And just last week I saw an older woman fall and break her hip because some guy was too busy to hold the door open for her!
23547	J.D.	Sir, you laughed and pointed when she fell.
23548	Dr. Kelso	I didn't say it wasn't funny; I just said it happened. Come on, when's the last time you saw a glimpse of humanity in this place.
23549	J.D.'s Narration	Kelso had a point. I mean, in the outside world you'll occasionally see a stream of cars drive by an old woman with a flat tire. But around here, every time you round a corner, well...
23550	Husband	She fell again.
23551	J.D.'s Narration	...Anyway, I knew what I had to do.
23552	J.D.	Just go, Jake! No one here knows your last name if anything happens, he'll never be able to find you. Go enjoy your little rafting thing in New Zealand which, incidentally, is ten thousand miles east of Australia, and famous for alcoholism and clam chowder. I've been brushing up on my New Zealand.
23553	Jake	You've been brushing up on New England.
23554	J.D.	Oh. Well go, anyway, wherever it is you're rafting.
23555	Dr. Cox	Where's he going?
23556	J.D.	He just left!
23557	Dr. Cox	Barbie. Go get him! I...believe in you?
23558	Elliot	Nnnno, you don't. You just want me to go and embarrass myself so you can laugh at me! Just like the time you told me the hospital fund-raiser was a costume party! I walked into a black-tie dinner dressed as Clarence Thomas....
23559	Dr. Cox	I was in a costume, too.
23560	Elliot	You...wore an Armani tux.
23561	Dr. Cox	I went as someone who doesn't make a fool out of himself. How'd you not get that?
23562	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23563	Dennis	Thank you.
23564	Dr. Kelso	Hey! I personally see to it that every inch of this building is up to the highest standards and codes!Well, that's just bad timing!
23565	Janitor	Come back here!Come on, fellas!
23566	J.D.'s Narration	And then something surprising happened.
23567	Dennis	Well, look who's back.
23568	Jake	Look, buddy, I, uh, I barely know your sister, and I certainly don't know you, but like it or not, she told me what she wanted and I'm gonna honor that. Anyway, I'm gonna go ahead and stay here 'til I can figure out a way to make you understand that, even if I have to get myself a lawyer.Not you.
23569	Janitor	They're smart, they are organized...and they've got my keys!
23570	J.D.'s Narration	It's amazing how a selfless gesture can affect so many people.
23571	Turk	I've got something I'd like to share today.
23572	Carla	Really?
23573	Turk	Yeah.
23574	J.D.'s Narration	One man was pushed to make the right decision.
23575	Dennis	Just make her as comfortable as possible.
23576	J.D.'s Narration	And another man realized it's okay to be a decent human being for once.
23577	Dr. Cox	Well, he's definitely leaving for good this time, there, Barbie. I'd, uh, I say go for it.
23578	Elliot	Why won't you leave me alone?
23579	Dr. Cox	Oh, I don't know.... Maybe because the NHL is on strike and I'm not getting my fill of toothless men knocking the hell out of each other. Or, maybe because for the first time in four years I'd actually like to see you happy for a change. You believe whatever you want, I don't really care. Jake the Snake is bearing down on you, and if I were you, I'd step up to him, look him straight in the eye with those beautiful blues, and...invite him out for a cup of coffee before he escapes.
23580	Elliot	Hey, um...can I buy you a cup of coffee before you escape?
23581	Jake	What, now?
23582	Elliot	I me I mean "go"?
23583	Jake	Yeah, that'd be nice.
23584	Elliot	Great.
23585	Dr. Cox	That's a cute couple. I give 'em a week.
23586	Janitor	I can make sure of that.
23587	Dr. Cox	No, thanks.
23588	Elliot	Oh, congratulations, Clarissa!
23589	J.D.'s Narration	As for me, seeing Jake come back and do the right thing restored my faith in humanity.
23590	Lady	I can't believe that six young men stopped to help an old lady change a tire!
23591	J.D.	And don't you forget who put that tire on and tightened those lugnuts, Martha! Okay, sweetie, have fun at the swap-meet! Drive safe.
23592	J.D.'s Narration	Yep. It sure feels good to do the right thing.
23593	J.D.	Righty loosey, lefty tighty.
23594	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, "righty tighty! lefty loosey!" Ohhhh, man. It still feels good.
23595	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23596	J.D.'s Narration	No one wants to live out their last years in a hospital, but people do. There's really not much we can do for them except try to protect their dignity. And, of course, bet on them.
23597	J.D.	Come on, Mr. Gilmore.
23598	Turk	Come on, Colonel Mustard!HA! Pay up.
23599	Mr. Gilmore	Can I get some Jell-O, please?
23600	J.D.	Jello-O is for winners.
23601	Mr. Gilmore	What?
23602	J.D.	I'm just kidding. We'll have some sent right to your room, big guy.
23603	Mr. Gilmore	Thank you.
23604	J.D.	Dude, you're not gonna believe how much trouble I'm having finding a place to live.
23605	Turk	What happened with that little guest house you went to see?
23606	Realtor	It's fully furnished, and the owner of the main house is just great. In fact, if you look out the window, you can see him right now.
23607	Owner	Ohh, he's perfect.
23608	J.D.	Perfect for what?Yeah, I think I'm gonna keep looking.
23609	J.D.'s Narration	Things were going better for Elliot.
23610	Elliot	Thanks for the movie.
23611	Jake	You're welcome for the movie.
23612	J.D.'s Narration	For some reason, Jake was able to handle the piping hot giant bowl of crazy that is Elliot Reid.
23613	Elliot	Oh God.
23614	Jake	What is it?
23615	Elliot	I just locked the door when a black guy walked by. Now he's gonna think that I think he's dangerous 'cause he's black; and not just black, but with an actual 'fro and everything which, trust me, I don't find scary at all. Not like the zigzags and the cornrows and stuff. My life's ruined!
23616	Jake	No it isn't.Hey, did you think she was locking the door 'cause you're black?
23617	Black Guy	No. I just thought she was locking the door.
23618	Jake	Thanks, man.Better?
23619	Elliot	Coolio! Let's go get some ice cream!
23620	J.D.'s Narration	Unfortunately for Jake, he still had to pass muster with Turk and me. And nothing is quite as daunting as our "good guy test."
23621	J.D.	Well, I could use a beer.
23622	Jake	I got this round. Be right back.
23623	J.D.	Good guy.
23624	Turk	Great guy.
23625	J.D.	Yeah.
23626	Turk	Oh, my God!
23627	J.D.	Excellent choice.
23628	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23629	Janitor	Aaaand finished. I remember the bordello being a little bit bigger and there were probably a few more prostitutes, but maybe I just remember it that way 'cause I was a kid it was my twelfth birthday. I asked for a bike. I got a 48-year-old whore.
23630	Doug	It's beautiful. It's almost a shame I get these casts off in a week.
23631	Janitor	A month.
23632	Doug	A what?
23633	Janitor	Yeah, I worked too hard on this you can take 'em off in a month.
23634	Doug	I'll call my orthopedist.
23635	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Murphy, I'd have more sympathy if this were the first time you broke both your feet working in the morgue.
23636	Doug	Sir, it's like those corpses are out to get me!
23637	Dr. Kelso	Heh! If only. Anyway, uh, I need you to give up this thing . No offense, son, but I can't have a delusional bozo like you driving a motorized vehicle around this hospital.
23638	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23639	J.D.	What are you doing?
23640	Ted	Dr. Kelso told me to stand here at exactly 12:05 with my lunch, but I don't know why.
23641	Dr. Kelso	Thanks, Ted!
23642	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23643	Dr. Cox	All right, everybody! Gather around here, circle it up, will ya? Bring it in nice and tight. Look, I know I'm pretty quick to point out other people's mistakes but...I have a son now, and I also realize that it's important to recognize when someone does something right. Mr. Blake down in Bed 3 came in here with what seemed like a basic heart block. But someone took the time to find out that recently he'd been camping and correctly diagnosed him with Lyme Carditis. Now, I'm sure some of your are gonna think this is a silly exercise, but I'd like that someone to step forward and stick your hand up in the air so that the group can recognize your great good work. This this is no time to be modest. Come now.Oh! My God! It was me! I did it, I'm a genius, I'm a huge brain in a ripped up body, I am Jesus H. Cox...M.D.
23644	Lonnie	That's me, daddy.
23645	J.D.	Put your hand down, Lonnie.
23646	Dr. Cox	And then there was the resident who confirmed that misdiagnosis.
23647	J.D.	In my defense, I was up late watching a 'Designing Women' marathon.
23648	Dr. Cox	And, last but not least, there was the surgeon who wanted to crack open Mr. Blake's chest like a walnut and put in a pacemaker that he didn't even need. Now, he's too modest to introduce himself to the group, so I'll do the honors. He is so black, so bald, and he can't eat cupcakes because he's got diabetes. Ladies and gentlemen, Chris Turk!
23649	Turk	Can you just get out of here so we can get back to work?
23650	Dr. Cox	Not until people start chanting my name so that I can exit the room with my hands held high above my head in a victorious gesture. Capisce? You see, this diagnosing machine, this fabulous thing? Well, it runs on props, so I'm going to need to hear it. Come now.
23651	Group	Cox...Cox...Cox...Cox...Cox...Cox....
23652	Dr. Cox	Me. Me. Me. Oh, so me!
23653	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23654	Elliot	I've never connected with a guy like this before. I mean, even though it's only been two weeks, I already feel like I know Jake better than I know myself.
23655	Carla	What does he do for a living?
23656	Elliot	I should know that.
23657	Turk	What's the sex like?
23658	Elliot	What makes you think that I have slept with him?
23659	Dr. Kelso	For starters, you've known him more than ten minutes.
23660	Elliot	You are a weird and angry man!Look, I have just been thinking about all of my relationships, and every time one has potential, I go too fast and ruin everything. Long story short, Jake's not getting any.
23661	J.D.	Oh, please, you're a half a glass of wine away from nuding up and doing your go-to move.
23662	Turk	Which is?
23663	J.D.	Her on top, eyes closed, yelling, "Don't look at me! Don't look at me!"
23664	Elliot	Sex is disgusting!
23665	Carla	I know, sweetie.
23666	Elliot	Look...I am attracted to Jake, but I'm an adult. I can control my urges.No means no!

23680	Turk	Ah, yeah.
23681	Dr. Cox	Guy's choking!I can't clear his airway. Call 9-1-1! Let's go!
23682	Turk	He'll be brain-dead by the time they get here
23683	Dr. Cox	Come on!
23684	Turk	I'm gonna do an emergency trach. Lemme get a knife!A clean knife!
23685	Dr. Cox	Hey now, great work back there, Gandhi. What a story, huh? Blood, bravery, illegal immigrants it had it all. Hell, when you tell Carla about this, the next time you two have sex, there's a slight chance that she actually just might think about you.
23686	Turk	Heh! Perry, Perry, Perry. You know what the difference between us is? Well, besides the fact that I can carry a conversation without checking my own reflection every five seconds?
23687	Dr. Cox	I'm sorry. I I get lost in my eyes.
23688	Turk	Anyway, I'm not gonna tell anyone about this because, unlike youunlike you, I got in medicine to help people, not for my own personal glory.
23689	Dr. Cox	Yeah, now that's just a load of crap. Turns out the only reason anybody ever does anything is to feed the ego. Because that's what we are ego monsters. Mark my words: eventually you will tell people what'cha did.
23690	Turk	Yeah, we'll see.
23691	Dr. Cox	Yeah, we'll see.
23692	Turk	Yeah, we will see.
23693	Dr. Cox	We will so see.

23701	Guys	No way! She can't do that! Nooo!
23702	J.D.	Calm down, boys. Let me just ask.Can you really swallow your whole fist?
23703	Elliot	Yeah.
23704	Guys	Ohhhhhhhhhhhh.
23705	J.D.	Shhh. Don't ruin it.
23706	Carla	Men are twisted.
23707	Elliot	Do you guys have any other ideas?
23708	J.D.	You know what, I really don't have time to be dealing with your little sex pickle.
23709	Dr. Kelso	Really? She spent two years dealing with yours.
23710	Carla	Ha!
23711	J.D.	I hate that thing.
23712	Janitor	Sir, you probably haven't noticed this, but the floors around here are so clean you can see yourself in them.
23713	Dr. Cox	Huh! Why, you handsome son of a gun!
23714	Janitor	I know we haven't care of that whole asbestos thing from the '90s, and I know some toilets flush upward...
23715	Dr. Kelso	Get to the point. My battery power's running low.
23716	Janitor	The one thing that I'm proud of is that these floors are so clean you could eat off of 'em.
23717	Dr. Kelso	Why is that?
23718	Janitor's Mom	If you're going to throw food on the floor, you can just eat there from now on.
23719	Janitor	Soup night was the worst.

23721	Dr. Cox	All righty! Point-proving time. Carla, I assume tubby hubby here told you all about what happened at the taco stand?
23722	Carla	Please, tell me you didn't try to get free guacamole again by telling them you were married to one of their people.
23723	Turk	No, I did not! Because I don't have the need to make everything about me. See, I'm not that pathetic.
23724	Carla	So what did happen at the taco stand?
23725	J.D.'s Narration	There are certain people in life who know how to push your buttons.
23726	Dr. Cox	Well, the guy started choking, so naturally I sprung into action and gave him an emergency trach.Yeah.
23727	J.D.'s Narration	So it's important to have a plan to deal with it. Even if it means never being alone with someone.
23728	Jake	Wow, this 'Body Heats a sexy movie, huh?
23729	J.D.	Mmm. Doesn't Kathleen Turner have dynamite nerps?
23730	Elliot	Yeah.
23731	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, if that person is stubborn, there's not much you can do.
23732	Dr. Kelso	Yeah, I'm sorry, son, I'd love to help you out, but I could give a horse's patootie about your floors.
23733	Janitor	My floors are my children! I'VE GIVEN THEM NAMES!
23734	J.D.'s Narration	The key is to figure out a way to not let them get the best of you.
23735	Dr. Cox	Honestly, it was like Death and I had a staring match, and, well, Death blinked. Now, all of you know I'm not one to toot my own horn, but, uh...beep, beep.
23736	Turk	Okay, that's it! That's it! I can't take this anymore! That's it! I saved the guy, people! Death blinked at me! You got that? He blinked at me! Okay?

23741	Jordan	Well, I should have been told that!
23742	Dr. Cox	Wouldn't have mattered, Jordan. You know why? Because I am always right. It's something my...my old pal, Gandhi here, knows a little something about, because, you see, we are both egotistical peas in a giant narcissistic pod. And, to prove my point, I'm gonna go ahead and make a......unnecessarily showy but undeniably impressive exit. Rope time, Gandhi.Feel it. I'll see ya later.
23743	Jordan	I would so mock him right now if I wasn't so turned on!
23744	Turk	I'm not like that, am I?
23745	Carla	Actually, Turk, you are slightly Coxish. Yeah! I mean, the way you do that stupid victory dance every time you win the slightest argument?
23746	Turk	No I don't!

23754	Jake	Bye.
23755	Carla	Elliot, you can't keep taking J.D. everywhere you go. Sooner or later, you're gonna have to trust yourself.

23757	Jake	That seems like a...a strange thing to announce to your friends.

23776	Dr. Cox	Did you possibly eat a large gall-boulder and then fall on your stomach?
23777	Mr. Hoffner	Do I need my gallbladder?
23778	Dr. Cox	Oh my God, it is a completely useless organ. Oh, wait a minute, that's not completely true. Here, it turns out, we could remove it and then jam it in your mouth to keep you from asking the same question we've been going over for three straight days. Now, come on, we're both in a position to get some good news here: You're gonna feel better, and I'm gonna get the world's most annoying patient the hell out of my hair.

23792	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23793	Mr. Hoffner	So, uh, are you a good surgeon?
23794	Turk	I'm capable.
23795	Mr. Hoffner	"Capable." I'm not sure I want I want the surgery.
23796	Dr. Cox	Gandhi? A word?Lookit, I know what you're doing in there. You think that if you act like Dr. Sad Sack that the patient's gonna opt out of surgery and I'll have to spend yet another week with a man who has such an unnatural attachment to his gallbladder that, left to his own devices, he would rent a motel room and have sex with it. Now come on, I need you to sling that "I'm gonna get freaky-deeky with my chizzle and and slizzle up the dizzle for my...bee-aye...yitch" stuff that, you know, you do so well.
23797	Turk	Sorry, I'm not that guy anymore.
23798	Mr. Hoffner	Are you sure I don't need my gallbladder?
23799	Dr. Cox	Oh...dear...Lord...
23800	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23801	Elliot	Look, the reason I've been acting so weird and having my friends hang around us all the time is because I really think that we have a shot for something great, and I don't wanna go and ruin it by sleeping with you too fast. I mean, what was I supposed to do?
23802	Jake	Well, you...you could have just told me that.
23803	Elliot	Yes, but you're forgetting I'm a crazy person!
23804	Jake	Elliot, please, look, everybody has their stuff. 'Kay, like me. I'm an emotional person, but I've always had trouble expressing it. Well, here, tell me...tell me you like my shirt.
23805	Elliot	I like your shirt.
23806	Jake	Cool.
23807	Elliot	Uh, Buster's coming home.
23808	Jake	Cool.See, there's no difference, and Buster meant the world to me. I really like you, Elliot, but I'm an adult. I want this to be an adult relationship. If you wanna be patient and not have sex right away, then that's fine. 'Cause I think we have a chance for something great, too.
23809	Elliot	I want you so bad right now.
23810	Jake	Cool.
23811	J.D.	Guess I should get goin'....
23812	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23813	Janitor	You paged me in the middle of a busy day! This better be important!
23814	Dr. Kelso	What were you doing?
23815	Janitor	Sleeping in a mop closet.
23816	Dr. Kelso	You forced me to do this! Either we figure out a way to share the Rascal, or neither one of us gets it. Your move. You've got about eight seconds before this thing becomes a pile of rubble.Five seconds.
23817	Janitor	I doubt it.
23818	Dr. Kelso	You moved my car there, didn't you!
23819	Janitor	Like I said key to everything.
23820	Crazy Guy	Whoops.
23821	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23822	Todd	I know it sounds corny, but we really made a big difference in that person's life in there.
23823	Turk	Hey, you know, it's not about me.
23824	Todd	Assisted five! I'll take it!
23825	Dr. Cox	Walk with me.
23826	J.D.	Page me when you're headed home!
23827	Dr. Cox	Bottom line, in medicine, half of pulling it off is believing you're the biggest, smartest bad-ass of a doctor to ever walk these halls. You wanna see how you end up if you don't believe that?
23828	Doug	I don't know how it happened again, but it did!
23829	J.D.'s Narration	As I gangsta-leaned down the hallway in the rad new wheels I found by the dumpster, I couldn't help but think how ego affects everything.Without a healthy dose of it, you can't trust yourself to do what you really want.
23830	Elliot	I don't think that we were going too quick at all. By the way, what do you do?
23831	Jake	I make and distribute Hungarian pornography.
23832	Elliot	Ohhh!
23833	Jake	I'm a real estate developer.
23834	Elliot	Oh, thank God!
23835	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, with too much ego you can end up losing something you wish you still had.
23836	Janitor	You okay?
23837	Dr. Kelso	I'm not used to walking from my office to the nurses' station.
23838	J.D.'s Narration	But with the right amount, nothing can get in your way.
23839	Turk	I am going to yank that gallbladder out of you so fast that your spleen is gonna say to your kidney, "WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO FRANK!?!" That's right, your kidney named your gallbladder Frank. I don't want you to worry about this another second, Mr. Hoffner, okay? 'Cause I'm the man. I am the man!Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwww, look at you! Hahaha! High five! Right there!
23840	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23841	J.D.'s Narration	So here I am. Sitting on a box, in an empty apartment with a dead dog, and a single tear on my cheek. I can't help but wonder how I got to this place.
23842	Turk	Who are these guys?
23843	J.D.	These are the last eight guys in the hospital who don't realize I suck at basketball.
23844	Turk	Ah.
23845	J.D.	Okay, so here's what's gonna happen: I finally mastered my running hook-shot, okay?
23846	Turk	Ah-huh?
23847	J.D.	So when we go to pick teams, I'm gonna hit that shot. Then you say, "I'll take that guy!" At which point, Carla is gonna page me . And I'll say, "Crap, I gotta go." And you go, "Damn! We just lost the best player out here!" Then there'll be eight guys in the hospital who think I'm good at sports, and word will spread.
23848	Turk	When do you find time to see your patients?
23849	J.D.	Between these thoughts.
23850	Turk	Oh. Okay. Let's play some ball!I got that guy.
23851	J.D.'s Narration	Elliot's boyfriend, Jake, had given her confidence to do things she'd never been able to do before.
23852	Jake	Okay, you ready to do this?
23853	Elliot	You know it!
23854	J.D.'s Narration	...Like talking to people when she's on the toilet.
23855	Jake	Uh, okay, uh, I know how comfortable you are with Carla, so I'm gonna have her do the talking, all right? You just say when.
23856	Elliot	There's cheeks on the seat, and I'm feeling good! Let's hear it.
23857	Carla	Hello, Elliot. How are you doing?
23858	Jake	She went out the window.
23859	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23860	Dr. Cox	Whoa! Bob Kelso here before noon? They're either giving away free doughnuts at the café, or there's an Asian prostitute convention in the I.C.U.!
23861	Dr. Kelso	Is now the time I'm supposed to be embarrassed because I like fine food and Korean call girls? Write this down, Perry: I'm old and I honestly don't care what people think about anything I do.That was me, folks.
23862	Ted	Three-twelve times four-eighty-one equals.... Sir, it's not giving me the answer!
23863	Dr. Kelso	It's a typewriter, you jackass!
23864	Ted	Oh, God, it's got my tie!
23865	Dr. Cox	Bob, this whole thing is only gonna take a couple of days, so why not let Jordan do it? Yes, she is a member of the board, but, hell, that only gets her out of the house once every couple of months or so. And I know she loves our son Jack with all her heart, but I think spending every waking moment with the child, I think...I think it's starting to get to her.
23866	Jordan	I hate you!
23867	Dr. Cox	So, whatta you say, there, Bobbo?
23868	Dr. Kelso	Welcome aboard! This will be your office for the next few days!
23869	Ted	Aw, man! Not again!
23870	Jordan	In this hell-hole, I'll need a gun!
23871	Ted	Bottom left.
23872	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23873	J.D.	So, yo, could I ask you a question?
23874	Turk	Yeah.
23875	J.D.	Why are we lying in the parking lot?
23876	Turk	Your hook-shot knocked you unconscious, so I lied down next to you so everyone would just think we were chillin'.
23877	J.D.	Oh, thanks SCB! By the way, I should tell you something: I found an apartment, I'm moving out the day after tomorrow.
23878	Turk	Wow.
23879	J.D.	Yeah.
23880	Turk	What does "SCB" mean?
23881	J.D.	"Super Chocolate Bear."
23882	Turk	I love it.
23883	J.D.	I knew you would.
23884	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23885	Nurse	Someone stole a whole case of laxatives from the supply closet.
23886	Nurse Roberts	Don't look at me I'm as regular as rain.
23887	Janitor	Who wants a piece of pie!
23888	J.D.	Who made it?
23889	Janitor	Let's say my mom.
23890	J.D.'s Narration	As a doctor, you get good at piecing things together.
23891	Nurse	Someone stole a case of laxatives.
23892	Janitor	Who wants a piece of pie!
23893	J.D.'s Narration	This one was obvious.
23894	J.D.	No thank you.
23895	Todd	Free pie? Hell yeah!
23896	Carla	I can't believe you two have lived together for twelve years.
23897	Turk	Do you remember our first day together?Yo, they call me Chris One. What's the dilly-yo?
23898	J.D.	Welcome to our lair! I'm an eighth-level ogre magi with invisibility. And this is Randall!You were a dork!I'm glad nothing else around here is changing.
23899	Carla	You see, this is the time of year where everybody leaves for new jobs, but Turk's got another year of residency.
23900	Elliot	Yeah, and J.D. and I just took positions here as staff internists.
23901	Jake	Is that what you wanted to do?
23902	Elliot	There was an endocrinology fellowship with this amazing doctor over at County, but it was a little over my head.
23903	Jake	So you took a fall-back job because you were afraid to go for it?
23904	J.D.	Uhh, Jake...is it?
23905	Jake	Yeah, it's
23906	J.D.	I know your name, Jake, I'm being condescending.
23907	Todd	Out of my way! I got a doozy of a twosie!
23908	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23909	Dr. Cox	All right, then, before we jump in to rounds, I see it's time for my annual cologne intervention. Lonnie, you're killing us. And, honestly, what's the point? D'you understand that no matter how badly you wanna get freaky with Karen, here, that's just not going to happen, and here's why: She thinks you have the body of a fetus. Oh, Karen, did you tell me that in confidence?
23910	Karen	No, he knows.
23911	Lonnie	She drew me a picture.
23912	Jordan	Don't sweat it too much, kid. He wore so much cologne on our first date, I had to sell my Miata!
23913	Dr. Cox	WHY?
23914	Jordan	For funsies!
23915	Dr. Cox	Heel!
23916	Lonnie	Thanks for that.
23917	Jordan	Keep movin', fetus face.
23918	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23919	J.D.	Come here, boy! Come on, Rowdy!
23920	Turk	No, you come here and eat your steak!
23921	Carla	What are you doing?
23922	J.D.	Oh, whoever Rowdy goes to first, he gets to keep him.
23923	Carla	So, you moved back all the furniture and defrosted our dinner with your sweaty hands for a joke!?
23924	Turk	Yeah, we did....
23925	Carla	If he stays, I'll drive him out to the country and leave him there.
23926	J.D.'s Thoughts	Huzzah! He's mine!
23927	Elliot	I can't believe you talked me into this! I will never get this fellowship I don't interview well. It's the reason I didn't get into Harvard. The second the professor asked me what I hoped to accomplish in college, my nose started bleeding, and I sneezed and splattered his shirt with blood.
23928	Jake	You know, dammit, Elliot, how many people do you have to talk to while you're peeing before you start believing in yourself?
23929	Elliot	You're right.
23930	Doctor	So...why are you interested in this fellowship?
23931	Elliot	Ahem. Well, first off, I have incredible passion for the work you're doing. I've heard that you're an amazing doctor and I would be honored to have the opportunity to work with you, Mr. Gold.
23932	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23933	Jordan	Have a great day, honey!
23934	Dr. Cox	You have even a better one, you! You do it, you! Yeah, you have even a better one!
23935	Dr. Kelso	Perry, I get the feeling something is bothering you.
23936	Dr. Cox	Bob, people have a private life and people have a professional life, and usually those two hells are kept pretty separate. For instance, I don't know that much about your home life, other than the fact that you treat your wife like a dog, your dog like a wife, and your son like an androgynous ne'er-do-well who drained your retirement nest-egg to open up a yarn shop in Minneapolis.
23937	Dr. Kelso	Harrison posted his first profit this quarter.
23938	Dr. Cox	Aces.
23939	Dr. Kelso	Terrence.
23940	Dr. Cox	Terrence doesn't follow him around the shop all day telling him just exactly what color is "in" this season or showing all of the other employees that he is not in fact the boss of his own life. You see, the woman is everywhere! She's there when I work out in the morning, when I work out in the car on the way to work, and when I work out when I get to work. I can't seem to get away from her. And that used to be fine when she just came around for five minutes every month or so to feed on my dignity, but now, I'd honestly kill myself, Bob, if I wasn't convinced that Jordan wouldn't already be there waiting for me in the afterlife. You see, typical of her, she went ahead and signed us up for an eternal tandem bike-ride all along the banks of the River Styx.
23941	Dr. Kelso	I'm so glad you shared.How would you like to make this a full-time job?
23942	Jordan	I'll have to think about it!
23943	Dr. Kelso	How could you not see this coming?
23944	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23945	J.D.	Hooch just got in the shower.
23946	Turk	Let the games begin.
23947	Hooch	Who the hell...put bouillon cubes in the shower head!?! Huh? Hm, did you do it? Hm? Did you? If it happens again, I will wait in my S.U.V., blast me some speed-metal 5.1 surround sound, heavy on the bass and someone...will be getting...mowed...down.Deet-deet-deet!
23948	J.D.	Hooch is crazy!I'm really gonna miss this kinda stuff.
23949	Turk	Why? We'll still be able to pull pranks on him after you move out.
23950	J.D.	Yeah, but we won't be able to stay up 'til six in the morning planning anything as genius as the soup shower! This is the end of an era, Super Choc.
23951	Turk	You know how you're prone to overly sensitive girly displays of sentimentality?
23952	J.D.	Guilty.
23953	Turk	Okay, now, if you reel it back a little bit, I'll get somebody to cover for me tonight, and I'll help you pack your stuff.
23954	J.D.	Oh! Can we cut words out of magazines that represent how we feel about each other and glue them into a "Friends Forever" collage?
23955	Turk	Hell no.
23956	J.D.	Oh. Well, can we drink beers and reminisce?
23957	Turk	Hell yes!
23958	J.D.	That's all I wanted to do anyway.
23959	J.D.'s Thoughts	Plus, I already made the collage.
23960	Turk	Now, listen to me. You gotta make tonight count. 'Cause you'll never be as cool as you were when you were rollin' with The Big Dog as your roommate, you know?
23961	J.D.'s Thoughts	No, I didn't know.
23962	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23963	Carla	Well, maybe Jake shouldn't have pushed you into that interview.
23964	Elliot	Maybe I should have covered my mouth when I sneezed blood the second time.
23965	Carla	Oh, come on, Elliot! He's always telling you what to do.
23966	Elliot	That's not true!
23967	Intercom	Hey, it's Jake, buzz me up.
23968	Elliot	Ohhh, my God, you're right.
23969	Carla	Don't let him be your puppet-master.
23970	Jake	Hey!
23971	Elliot	Hey.
23972	Jake	What's up?
23973	Elliot	I have a headache.
23974	Jake	Take some aspirin.
23975	Elliot	Don't tell me what to do! You're not the boss of me!
23976	Jake	Okay, what just happened?
23977	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23978	Jordan	So, do you think I should take the job? Perry?
23979	Dr. Cox	Oh. I'm sorry, honey. I was just thinking about this little boy in here. He's only eight years old and he's terminal. I just hope his parents spent as much time with him as they could you're here one minute, and then the next you're.... What, uh, what were you saying?
23980	Jordan	Nothing.
23981	Dr. Cox	Stick your hand out.
23982	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23983	Turk	Hey! Oh! Oh! J.D.! I got a mondo 82-inch pizza with our names on it! Dude! It's huuuuDude? What the hell, we're supposed to hang and all of a sudden you moved out?
23984	J.D.'s Narration	It's hard to hide your emotions in front of people who know you well.
23985	Jake	Answer it.Or don't.
23986	Elliot	Hello?
23987	J.D.'s Narration	...Like excitement about a new job...
23988	Elliot	I got the fellowship!
23989	Jake	Hey!
23990	J.D.'s Narration	...Or disappointment about a lost opportunity...
23991	Jordan	I'm sorry, Bob, I can't take the job.
23992	Dr. Kelso	Maybe next year.
23993	J.D.'s Narration	As for me, I just didn't want Turk to know that he'd hurt my feelings.
23994	J.D.	I dunno, I figured it wasn't that big a deal. Anyway, I'm pretty tired from the move, so I'm probably just gonna crash....Sort of famished...
23995	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23996	Ted	Morning.
23997	Turk	Mm.
23998	J.D.'s Narration	Turk didn't even realize he'd pissed me off, so explaining my feelings to him was the smart move. I took a slightly different tack.
23999	J.D.	That seat's taken, ass-face!
24000	Turk	By who?
24001	J.D.	Hello there, Chocolate Bear Two.
24002	Turk	Hooch!? J.D., what the hell is going on here!?
24003	J.D.	I replaced your ass!
24004	Hooch	By the by, Johnny told me that you were responsible for my...brothy shower the other day.
24005	Turk	Well, you know....
24006	Hooch	If it happens again, I'm gonna take one of your fingers. That'll be my...funny prank.
24007	J.D.	Hooch is crazy.Oh, sorry, old habit.
24008	J.D.'s Narration	I wasn't the only unhappy person in our hospital family.
24009	Carla	Sure, Jake, I'll tell you why it feels like I have a problem with you. The fact that Elliot jumps so high whenever you tell her to may seem harmless, but as a result she's been stealing all my sports bras! Seriously, the only one I have left is the one I'm wearing; and it works great, see? Huh?
24010	Jake	It works pretty nicely.
24011	Carla	It does, right?
24012	Jake	Okay, I'm obviously gonna have to guess what your point is here, but I think it's that I control Elliot? Which I don't. Here, watch this: Elliot, will you shove that guy?Why would you do that? I was tr I was trying to prove you don't do everything I say.
24013	Elliot	Well, clue me in, stud! That was Creepy Carl he runs an up-skirt website. ...I'm on it...
24014	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24015	Jordan	Oh, yeah, Ted, I moved the file cabinet.
24016	Dr. Cox	Why? It smells like that odd combo of flopsweat, hopelessness, and feet.
24017	Jordan	Yeah, I know, it's just...I guess this stupid job made me feel valid again, you know? You don't know. It's okay. See you at home.
24018	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24019	Janitor	Who's ready for a pie break?
24020	J.D.	No!
24021	Janitor	Come on, why not?
24022	J.D.	Why don't you ask Todd? Due to what can only be described as epic diarrhea, he's been on an I.V. drip for thirty-six hours!
24023	Todd	Make-it-stop five?
24024	J.D.'s Thoughts	Maybe I was being unfair to Turk. Maybe it's too much to expect a friend to just sense that you're upset and wanna talk about it.
24025	Elliot	Carla, I can sense you're upset. Talk to me.
24026	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, but Turk's a prideful guy, and it's hard for prideful guys to admit when they've been insensitive.
24027	Dr. Cox	Listen, Jordan, I've been incredibly insensitive.
24028	J.D.'s Thoughts	Touché, magic hallway.
24029	J.D.	Turk!
24030	Hooch	No, it's me Hooch, Vanilla Bear! Heh heh!
24031	J.D.	Hooch is crazy....So, Hooch, this is it.
24032	J.D.'s Narration	Then things took a turn.
24033	J.D.	Wait, where's Rowdy?There he is!THERE HE IS!
24034	Hooch	I'll try.
24035	Turk	So where's Chocolate Bear Number Two?
24036	Hooch	Who else thinks they're faster than me, huh? Huh!?
24037	J.D.	Yo, Hooch is seriously crazy.
24038	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24039	Elliot	Well, look, Carla, Jake makes me happy! Plus, there's a decent chance he'll be my second serious boyfriend not to end up in bed with my mom or my brother Barry. And he doesn't always tell me what to do. I mean, sure, he did tell me to come up here and talk to you, but I was gonna do that anyway 'cause I wanted to ask if you thought I should wear hooker heels or flats with my pink skirt when we go celebrate my new job tonight but instead I'm trying to figure out what your problem is.
24040	Carla	Look! I thought you were staying, okay?
24041	Elliot	Not if I go with you!
24042	Todd	And then they kiss?
24043	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24044	Jordan	Look at him. What an angel.Down! He's waking up!
24045	Dr. Cox	Hey, Jordan, um.... Lookit, I tried to guilt you into not taking that job.
24046	Jordan	Really?Look, I don't wanna be one of those moms that never sees her kids. But I also don't wanna be one of those moms that stays at home but then resents her kids 'cause she wishes she was working so she could go to an office and feel bad about not being at home with her kids.
24047	Dr. Cox	Sweetie, you are an evil, soulless, chemically-enhanced battle-axe that I truly doubt is a hundred percent human, but...you are an amazing mom.
24048	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24049	J.D.	Just say you're sorry, give me a hug, and this'll all be over.
24050	Turk	Why do I have to say I'm sorry?
24051	J.D.	Dude, I don't mean to sound girly, but, for the last twelve years, you've practically been like...my wife.
24052	Turk	How is that girly?
24053	J.D.	Look, before, when you said I'd never be as cool as when I was living with you, you know there's some truth to that. I'm sorta like odd and geeky, and you've always sort of...validated me.
24054	Turk	J.D., you're just moving out.
24055	J.D.	Well, say things'll be the same.
24056	Turk	That's Carla and I gotta go.
24057	J.D.	Mmkay.
24058	Turk	All right.
24059	Janitor	No better pick-me-up than a slice of Mom's pie!
24060	J.D.	Why are you so obsessed with this!?
24061	Janitor	I dunno. I think it's 'cause this time, I wasn't trying to mess with you.
24062	J.D.	Really?
24063	Janitor	Really.Huh?
24064	J.D.	Who would do this to themselves?
24065	Janitor	Totally worth it.
24066	J.D.'s Narration	As every piece of food I'd put into my body in the last year was rushing out of me, it got me thinking. The way some things never change shines a light on the things that do.Like when a new person comes into the hospital to stay...
24067	Jordan	My office keys, Ted?
24068	Elliot	I can't believe I'm actually doing this. You're meeting me out later, right?
24069	J.D.'s Narration	...Or an old friend leaves for good.Sometimes the biggest changes are a result of an impulsive decision.
24070	Carla	I think we should have a baby.
24071	Turk	Whoa!
24072	Carla	Hm?
24073	Turk	Whoa!!
24074	Carla	What?
24075	Turk	I know you're feeling abandoned right now, but we just went through a really rough spot, and I'm not the type of guy to make life-changing decisions without thinking about it for at least, like...a few months.Let's make a baby.
24076	J.D.'s Narration	And so here I am a guy in an empty apartment with a dead dog. Oh, and that's not a tear on my cheek, that's just from the leak in my ceiling. And, yes, change is scary, but it's also inevitable. It's up to you to make the best of it. I mean, it's not like opportunity is just gonna fall in to your lap.
24077	Woman	Agh!
24078	J.D.'s Narration	Then again....
24079	J.D.	Howdy, neighbor, I'm Jonathan!
24080	Woman	Hi.
24081	Guy	You eyeballin' my woman?
24082	J.D.'s Narration	I hate change.
24083	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24084	J.D.'s Narration	Since my apartment's roof collapsed, I was living in a hotel. But that's not the only thing that's changed around here.Now that I'm an attending, I'm a licensed bad-ass. Elliot actually works at a different hospital. She's trying to lay low the first couple of weeks.
24085	Elliot	Woooooo!
24086	J.D.'s Narration	And Turk and Carla are trying to make a baby.
24087	Carla	Here you go, baby. I know you love foreplay, but I only have five minutes, so I made you a sandwich.
24088	Turk	That's the sexiest thing I've ever seen.
24089	Carla	Over here, Turk.
24090	Turk	My bad, baby.
24091	J.D.'s Narration	Yep, life was pretty different.
24092	Porsche Owner	Hey! You took my Porsche from the valet?
24093	J.D.'s Thoughts	This didn't feel like my scooter.
24094	J.D.	Ow! Look, no harm done. Here's your driving glasses, here's your driving scarf, and here are you driving gloves.Fine, here's your driving sock.
24095	J.D.'s Narration	I didn't care, because now that I'm and attending, I had picked out a whole new look.
24096	J.D.	Morning, colleague!
24097	Dr. Cox	Oh, absolutely not.
24098	J.D.	Ooh, what, tall, dark and scary? I can wear whatever the hell I What are you doing?
24099	Dr Cox	This is my new, imaginary warning light. Whenever it starts blinking, a situation has ten seconds to resolve itself before I flash white with rage and kill someone. One, two, three, four...
24100	Dr. Cox	...seven, eight, nine and ten.
24101	J.D.	I had a little trouble getting my Baby Gap t-shirt off.
24102	Dr. Cox	It'll happen.
24103	J.D.	Ow.Whoooaaaaahhhh! OK, you know, I'm gonna I'm gonna go with 'ow.'
24104	Janitor	How depressing is it being you? I mean seriously, would you equate it more with being a lifelong Cub fan or to, say, being born without lips?
24105	J.D.	Born without lips.
24106	Janitor	I know a guy. His house just burned down.
24107	J.D.	How sad.
24108	Janitor	Well, he was smoking in bed. He shouldn't have smoked. Because he looked ridiculous.I have a snake face.
24109	J.D.	Listen, today, if you bother me, could you do it without being around me? Because I have new interns starting today. Can you imagine what it's like to see this place through their eyes for the first time?
24110	Todd	There's something on your shirt, kid.
24111	Camera	Huh?
24112	Todd	Ah ha ha! Classic.
24113	Jordan	Sparky! It's five dollars a minute to stare in public. It's free in private. Rrrrrr.
24114	Dr. Kelso	You're gonna love it here, sport!
24115	Ted	Get out while you still can!
24116	Camera	Uh...
24117	Ted	Seriously, get out while you still can.
24118	Laverne	Junior, have you seen Johnny? You know, the Alzheimer's patient who likes to tackle people?
24119	Camera	Mmmm, mm-mm.
24120	Laverne	Has anyone seen Johnny, the tackling Alzheimer's patient?
24121	J.D.	Hey! You must be Keith. Don't look so nervous, buddy, I got your back.
24122	Johnny	WHO AM I?!
24123	Laverne	I found him.
24124	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24125	J.D.	Someone's close enough for a hair-mussing! Digga-digga-digga-ha!Dynamite bangs. Hey guys, follow me. Listen, if you're having trouble finding a vein for an IV, please don't page me. If you're desperate, you're lucky. This is a city hospital, there are plenty of heroin addicts around who are quite adept at this. Did you find a vein there, Reverend Mayhem?
24126	Heroin Addict	No problem.
24127	J.D.	OK, good work, buddy. Stay in school.Mr. Kellerman, how're you feeling?
24128	Mr. Kellerman	Oh, not great.
24129	J.D.	Well, that's probably why you're here! Ha! Humor is a great ice-breaker for patients, OK? Follow me. Mr. Kellerman has congestive heart failure. OK, Lisa, I want you to start him on diuretics, OK? That way we'll loosen up some of the fluid around his lungs. The good news is, he'll go home tomorrow. Bad news is if he's not here he won't move up on the heart transplant list. See, in medicine there are lots of Catch 22's, a phrase made famous, I believe, by an old fisherman, who would stay out fishing until he caught how many fish? Anybody? That's right, 22. See, in 1492, Columbus
24130	Dr. Cox	Newbie! If you loved the sound of your very own voice any more, you'd probably just sit in a little room all day and sing to yourself.
24131	J.D.	Oh, you guys can skedaddle.
24132	Dr. Kelso	Booga-booga!
24133	Keith	Ahh!
24134	Dr. Kelso	I love interns! Gentlemen, a reminder, as attendings you are expected to turn in your insurance paperwork and your required urine sample by tomorrow.
24135	Dr. Cox	Bob, I'm not planning on doing any paperwork. But I did go ahead and leave my urine sample on your driver's side car door.
24136	Dr. Kelso	Perry, your lips, my ass, they should meet. Dorian, after four years, I can only hope that you are no longer following in his footsteps.
24137	J.D.	I turned in my paperwork already, but I'm gonna wait till tomorrow to turn in my urine sample out of respect for the fellows in the lab. There's an asparagus issue.
24138	Dr. Kelso	Now there's an answer that warrants a half-sincere pat on the shoulder.
24139	J.D.	Thanks, Dr. Kelso! You know he said half-sincere, but I think he was full-sincere. Feel my shoulder, it's still warm.
24140	Dr. Cox	Lindsay, by you reaching the level of attending physician, you've somehow managed to become a member of club that *I* belong to. Obviously, there was no vote, because if there had been, you would still hear the sound of my voice screaming, "Nay! Nay! Oh, dear God, one thousand times nay!" That being said, it's my obligation to let you in on the organization's one and only bylaw: We're men.
24141	J.D.	Yes we are.
24142	Dr. Cox	The women are men, the children are men, the men of course...*men.* So, I went ahead and took the liberty of making you five man cards.Hold them very dear because every time you drop the ball "manwise," I'm going to take one from you.
24143	J.D.	I don't need your approval, or your stupid man cards! Although the lettering is darling, have you ever done calligraphy?
24144	Dr. Cox	Thank you.
24145	J.D.	Damn it!
24146	J.D.'s Narration	That night, since we were low on cash, Turk snuck me into the movies.
24147	Turk	One, please.
24148	J.D.'s Narration	Afterwards, we talked about my living arrangements.
24149	J.D.	Are you sure about this?
24150	Turk	You shouldn't stay in a hotel, so why don't you just stay here until you find a place?
24151	J.D.	Carla was pretty psyched to get rid of me. Are you gonna tell her?
24152	Turk	I don't know, what do you think?
24153	Carla	Turk? Is that you?
24154	Turk	Yes, I'll be right in, baby.
24155	Carla	Mm, OK.
24156	J.D.	Turk, you left your gym shorts in here!
24157	Turk	Look. I gotta sex her up. I'll be back as quick as I can. So I'll be 'bout an hour and half.
24158	J.D.	W-w-w-wait! Could you quickly scratch my nose? Ah. Ooh. Okay. Okay.Don't zip me up. NO! Turk! Turk! Whoa, Whooooaaa!
24159	Elliot	I'm a little sick of the Turks!
24160	Omar	Excuse me?
24161	Elliot	No, not you, Omar, I love your people. I'm talking about their lovey-dovey crap.
24162	Carla	Oh, babe, I borrowed your backpack this morning and all my change fell out the bottom.
24163	J.D.	Maybe someone or something had to gnaw a hole in it to keep from suffocating.
24164	Turk	And maybe someone already apologized for that about a hundred times.
24165	J.D.	Well maybe a hundred wasn't enough, I don't know!
24166	Dr. Cox	Absolutely no lover's quarrels!
24167	J.D.	Damn it!
24168	Turk	Elliot, by the way, what are you doing here?
24169	Carla	Oh, she hasn't talked to anybody at her new hospital yet.
24170	Elliot	How did this conversation become about me?
24171	J.D.	The Turks are sneaky.Not you guys, I think Omar took my pudding.
24172	Omar	Mmmmm.
24173	J.D.	Hey Keith! Can I get your pudding?
24174	Keith	Uh...Eh..
24175	J.D.	Interns.
24176	Elliot	Oooh..
24177	Carla	Elliot, you should be excited about meeting people over there. You could totally reinvent yourself.
24178	Elliot	You're right! I am gonna tell them that I am the most perfect doctor ever, who never needs anyone's help with anything! Ha!
24179	Turk	That'll end well. Dude!
24180	J.D.	That's my pudding, Omar!Huh. This guy's unbelievable.OK, guys, for some reason Mr. Kellerman's fluid situation isn't getting any better. I think we should be more aggressive. Keith? Why don't you go get a Lasix drip.Other way, Keith!Uh, Jason, when you're filling out a female patient's exam report, her breasts can be healthy or unhealthy. Never "bangin' double-D's."
24181	Jason	There's so much paperwork. My dad was a veterinarian and he never had to do any. Sometimes I wish this place were more like a horse hospital.
24182	J.D.	I'm sorry, Mr. Larson, but I do not like the look of that leg.We would have better hours. All right, gang, get out of here. Hey, everybody? Great work today.
24183	Janitor	How do you bother someone without being around them? That is the question.
24184	Dr. Kelso	Dorian, I'm paying you to work, not stand around acting like The Fonz.
24185	Janitor	Perfect.
24186	J.D.'s Narration	Being Turk's secret roommate was going great. Until now.
24187	Carla	Turk? I'm leaving for work.
24188	J.D.'s Thoughts	OK, you've been working on your Turk impression since college. Time to shine!
24189	Carla	Turk?
24190	J.D.	Baby I'll be thinking about your lovelies and whatnot until the second I see you. But right now, I'm doin' my business.
24191	Carla	Don't forget to use the Glade!
24192	Turk	Dude! That's the best that's ever sounded!
24193	J.D.	I thought she was gone.
24194	Turk	Nah, she came back for a quickie. All this baby stuff, man, I feel like she rushed me into it. To tell you the truth I'm not even sure I'm ready.
24195	J.D.	Well, you better get ready. She's been off the pill for like a week.What have you done?
24196	Turk	Think she'll be mad?
24197	Doctor #1	Doctor Reid? You need some help?
24198	Elliot	Heh. I don't need anyone's help, thank you.Stop running!
24199	Doctor #2	Doctor? Do you know where the Foley caths are?
24200	Elliot	Sir, I know where everything is, ha ha. I'll be right back.Stupid coffee robot! Frick!Don't sweat it, kid. I used to hide here when I worked at this place. I'm in a fellowship now. Um, Foley cath, please. Thanks.
24201	Doctor #2	Thanks. Could you also grab a number six needle?
24202	Elliot	Oh. Frick, fricky, frick, frick!
24203	Janitor	Nice ass, grandma!
24204	J.D.'s Thoughts	That screaming patient would have to wait. I had bigger problems.
24205	J.D.	Hey, Keith! I just called upstairs to see how Mr. Kellerman was doing. And get this, the nurse told me you never even started him on a Lasix drip. And Lisa! Imagine my surprise when she told me you never even increased his diuretic in the first place! I'm forced to ask, are you people trained killers? Say something, Keith.
24206	Keith	Uh...I...Eh...Uh...
24207	Jason	Dr. Dorian? If he gets bad enough that we have to put him on inotropes, he'll jump to the top of the transplant list and then he'll get a new heart.
24208	J.D.'s Thoughts	They're messing up on purpose?
24209	J.D.	Who told you guys to do this?
24210	J.D.'s Narration	There's a lot of ways to get caught.Sometimes you get caught because you couldn't slip your wife her pill last night, so you had to feed her one of your special, homemade brownies.
24211	Carla	What's that?
24212	Turk	Oh, that that's a tiny marshmallow with writing on it.
24213	J.D.'s Narration	Still, if you don't panic, you can get away with it.
24214	Elliot	Just...doing some inventory...sir.
24215	Dr. Kelso	That's why I'm glad you work here, sweetheart.
24216	J.D.	Come on, guys. Who put you up to this?
24217	J.D.'s Narration	As for me, I caught my culprit because he made the classic mistake of returning to the scene of the crime. And all because I, too, had been eating Turk's special, homemade brownies.
24218	Dr. Cox	Angie, my buddy down in the lab just told me that your urinalysis came back positive for...the birth control pill. So. I will be taking one of these. Thank you!
24219	J.D.'s Thoughts	Damn it.
24220	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24221	J.D.	Keith, look at me.Did he specifically tell you to disregard my orders?
24222	Dr. Cox	Oh, what the hell. I was doing this and mouthing "I'll kill you" which I will, if you don't get out of here. Go on, get.
24223	Ted	Hey, I saw it first. Long day.
24224	Dr. Cox	Newbie, I did tell them to ignore you and let Mr. Kellerman get worse, and you want to know something? I'd do it again.
24225	Carla	Bye, Elliot.
24226	Turk	Look, I know I agreed to have a baby, but you were offering sex at the time. I would have agreed to anything!
24227	Carla	Ohh!
24228	Elliot	Carla, no.
24229	Turk	NO! She knows I can't eat without my strawberry milk. You should have just let her fork me!
24230	Elliot	I think that's how you got into trouble the first place. Wassup!
24231	Todd	Euphemism five!
24232	Elliot	His vocabulary has gotten so much better!
24233	Turk	Elliot, why are you here?
24234	Elliot	Oh. I have to make Kelso think I still work here so he doesn't have me arrested for stealing medical supplies. By the by, what would you have done if you couldn't give Carla the pill?
24235	Turk	I could have faked it.
24236	Elliot	Guys can't fake it.
24237	Turk	Really? Does this sound familiar? Oh! Oh, baby! We're goin' all night, no wait don't move! Sorry.
24238	Elliot	Way too familiar.
24239	J.D.	Hey!
24240	Dr. Cox	Thank you.
24241	J.D.	You know what I've been doing? I mean, besides listening to my Alanis Morissette CD to get me pumped up to talk to you? Here.
24242	Dr. Cox	Yup.
24243	J.D.	I've been thinking about how completely ridiculous it is that you would take Mr. Kellerman's life into your hands without talking to him.
24244	Dr. Cox	I did talk to him.
24245	Mr. Kellerman	He did.
24246	Dr. Cox	Patients who stay low on the heart transplant list die waiting for one. This way he moves up to the top of the list. Come on!
24247	J.D.	Then why didn't you tell me?
24248	Dr. Cox	Because you're an attending now. And that doesn't just mean a fat bank account, expensive new toys and a fancy lawyer on retainer for when you kill a prostitute. From now on, the buck stops with you, and I know that you have occasionally bent the rules in this dump over the last couple of years, but you only did it because you knew when the crap started raining down it was damn sure gonna fall on my head. But now, the only way for you to stay out of the trouble storm is for you to go by the book and I've got news for you on that front. By-the-book attendings kill us up here. Newbie, I couldn't tell you about Kellerman because I don't know what type of attending you're going to be.
24249	J.D.	Allow me to thank you for giving me the opportunity to prove myself. You know what? This is my last one, here.Take it! Whatever happens to this poor guy is on you.s Narration: The next morning was not good. Carla was not talking to Turk. Elliot had dropped by to help not talk to Turk, and I was sneaking out in my undies because my clothes were downstairs in the dryer.
24250	Elliot	J.D.?
24251	J.D.	Morning, friends! Who's ready for some java?
24252	Carla	Are you wearing boxers?
24253	J.D.	Yes, I am, Carla, because I know when Turk's sad, he likes me to come over in my boxers because he likes to call me his honky Adonis, and that's what friends do.
24254	J.D.'s Thoughts	They bought it? Are we that gay?
24255	Turk	What's that?
24256	J.D.	Oh, it's my new driving sock.You can borrow.
24257	Turk	Actually, J.D.'s been living here secretly.
24258	J.D.	Turk, why?
24259	Turk	Because I gotta get those damn judgmental eyes off me!
24260	J.D.	J.D. didn't want to live here, I begged him.
24261	Carla	Is that true?
24262	Turk	I didn't say that, J.D. can do my voice.
24263	Elliot	Hey, it's getting good!
24264	J.D.	Oh, thank you! Oh, I lost it.
24265	Carla	Oh, you three are ridiculous.
24266	Elliot	Hey! Pfft. I'm just here to grab a ride to work.
24267	Carla	At a hospital where you don't actually work! And you...?
24268	Turk	How am I supposed to tell you I might not be ready to have a baby when you're so excited?
24269	Carla	And you, secretly moving back in here? Now I really don't love being den mother to you three......fine, it's like crack to me. Still, let me ask you something. Why are you three so afraid of moving on?!
24270	Turk	Dude, you're still eating those brownies.
24271	J.D.	I don't wanna get pregnant! Shoot.
24272	Dr. Kelso	So, you're going to the university for a transplant! Well, come back and see us, okay?Who the hell is responsible for not treating that man?
24273	Dr. Cox	Well, Bobbo, I was going to treat him, but I lost my stethoscope...
24274	J.D.	He's my patient, Bob. I'm responsible.
24275	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Dorian, I've kept my mouth shut about all the recent sexual harassment complaints because I don't think it's fair to punish a man for making small talk, or say, asking his secretary just once to dress up as a geisha girl and call him Kelso-san.
24276	J.D.	What?
24277	Dr. Kelso	Nothing. But now I need to know: is this the type of attending you're going to be?
24278	J.D.	I guess so.
24279	Dr. Kelso	Anything else?
24280	J.D.'s Thoughts	I could tell him there's nothing in my cup and I'm just pretending to drink to seem non-chalant...
24281	J.D.	No.
24282	J.D.'s Thoughts	But instead, I was thinking about what Carla said about moving on. And I wasn't the only one.
24283	Dr. Kelso	Well, at least there's one attending around here I can count on.
24284	Elliot	Ah, the hell with it, Bob. I don't work here. Have a good one!
24285	Dr. Kelso	I hate this place.
24286	Dr. Cox	It hates you, Bob.
24287	Carla	That's it. All of my birth control pills are gone.
24288	Turk	Not exactly. That Fig Newton you're about to eat is not only fat free, but it's baby free.
24289	Carla	Blech.I just don't get it, Turk.
24290	Turk	Look, we've had sex twenty times in eight days and I bet it's because you sense my hesitance.
24291	Carla	I just want a baby so badly.
24292	Turk	Why? What's it gonna be like having a baby?
24293	Carla	Dr. Cox says it's like having a dog that slowly learns how to talk.
24294	Turk	Awesome.
24295	Carla	Right? And I come from a big family and I love that.
24296	Turk	Me, too.
24297	Carla	And every time we sit at the kitchen table I feel like someone's missing.
24298	Turk	I can see him.
24299	Carla	J.D.!
24300	J.D.	Gotta make a quick two-sie.This explains a lot.
24301	Janitor	Hey! Meet your volleyball team. They're terrible.
24302	Dr. Cox	Newbie, I heard your voice.
24303	J.D.	Thanks for nothing, assface.
24304	Dr. Cox	I'm gonna go ahead and give you back one of these man cards. You deserve it.
24305	J.D.	Wow. Want a hug?
24306	Dr. Cox	You held onto it as long as you could, didn't you?
24307	J.D.	I'm gonna have a good year, aren't I?
24308	Dr. Cox	Anything can happen.
24309	J.D.'s Narration	And I knew he was right.
24310	Janitor	Excuse me.
24311	J.D.	AARGH!
24312	J.D.'s Narration	For all of us.
24313	Doctor #1	Dr. Reid, are you joining us for lunch today?
24314	Elliot	Ah. Anyone want half a turkey cheese sandwich?
24315	Turk	Repeat after me: Boy, boy, boy. Very tall boy!
24316	Carla	Boy, boy, boy, very tall boy.
24317	Turk	Boy, boy...
24318	Carla	Tall boy...
24319	Turk	Very tall...
24320	Carla	Very...
24321	J.D.	Goodnight, Keith. Hey, keep your head up. You're doing a good job.
24322	Keith	Thanks for everything, Dr. Dorian.
24323	Johnny	Who am I?!
24324	J.D.	Waaaaaagh!
24325	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24326	J.D.	Hey, Turk, I'm gonna go across the street and get some coffee, you want one?
24327	Turk	Get me a small one-pump mocha.
24328	J.D.'s Thoughts	The perfect setup to a joke, but no one's around to hear!
24329	Turk	Wahh! Dude! Oh God! Waahuh! NOOOO! Dude!
24330	J.D.	So what did you want me to get you?
24331	Turk	A small one-pump mocha?
24332	J.D.	Wasn't that your nickname in high school? Hello! Huh, huh, huh, huh.
24333	Turk	Dude, there's a guy upstairs waiting to have his spleen removed.
24334	J.D.	It was worth it!
24335	Jordan	Let's go, Per!
24336	Dr. Cox	I've been waiting for an hour.
24337	Jordan	I know! I was leafing through a magazine and watching you on the security cameras. My favorite part was when you said, "Screw her!" and you stormed out and then you came back because you realized I have the keys!
24338	Dr. Cox	Jordan, now that you work here everyday, if the carpool torturing persists, I am going to put a Plexiglass separator right down the middle of the car so you can't drive me crazy; you can't, you can't, you can't! Unfortunately, your door handle doesn't work from the inside, which simply means that if we're in a fiery crash, you won't be able to get out. However, that's a risk I'm sure willing to take...Jordaroo?Hello?
24339	Jordan	I'm in here! You can't see me!
24340	Dr. Cox	JORDAN!! Oh...
24341	J.D.'s Narration	Not everyone was in hell at their jobs. In fact, there was only one thing Elliot didn't like about her new hospital: Charlie, her co-fellow.
24342	Elliot	Good morning, Charlie.
24343	Charlie	Uh, you wanna work on the osteogenesis imperfecta therapy with me?
24344	Elliot	Charlie, I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told you yesterday when you popped out of that HAZMAT bin. I work alone and you have somebody else's blood on your neck. Take a shower, man.
24345	Charlie	Fine. I'll just go.Yes! That is an intern in a bald cap.
24346	Elliot	I hate you, Charlie.
24347	J.D.	Hippocratic Oath on three! One! Two! Three!
24348	All	First, do no harm!
24349	J.D.	There it is! All right, kick some ass today, guys.Except for Mr. Woodson in 302, he's got that rectal tear.
24350	Dr. Kelso	You seem to be developing quite the rapport with your interns.
24351	J.D.	We even spent this weekend building a house for the homeless.
24352	Dr. Kelso	How'd that go?
24353	J.D.	Nice!In my defense, who wears a tie to a construction site?
24354	Dr. Cox	I believe in team-building, too, Newbie and I'd make my interns agree with me, but they're in a timeout right now because one of them used the phrase "Let's rock and roll."
24355	Dr. Kelso	Son, when you're an intern you get treated like crap and when you're in a position of power, you do the same thing to them. It's inevitable. Like the tide. Or the awkward toast I'm going to have to give someday at my son's big, gay wedding. Mark my words, eventually you'll treat them like dirt like the rest of us do.
24356	J.D.	Sir, I'd love to chat, but it's already eight. I gotta rock and roll.
24357	Dr. Cox	I beg your pardon.
24358	J.D.	I'm an attending!
24359	Dr. Cox	Tell it to the wall, Newbie!
24360	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24361	J.D.	Huh, huh, huh, huh. The answer's two!
24362	Janitor	What?
24363	J.D.	How many janitors does it take to change a light bulb? Two.
24364	Janitor	OK, that didn't make any sense. Hank's an electrician. And you are not funny.
24365	J.D.	I'm very funny. Earlier, I made a killer one-pump mocha joke and everybody laughed.
24366	Janitor	I bet that nobody laughed, but you didn't notice that because you were too busy doing that cocky self-laugh thing you do when you think you're being funny.
24367	J.D	Wasn't that your nickname in high school? Huh, huh, huh, huh.
24368	J.D.	Huh, huh, huh. Any-who, have a good one, Lurch.
24369	J.D.'s Narration	I had to skedaddle, because today was burger day in the cafe and that meant one thing: 75 hungry employees and one bottle of ketchup.
24370	J.D.	Got the ketchup.
24371	Turk	And here is your burger.
24372	Elliot	Aw, frick, I forgot my burger.
24373	Turk	No, she didn't!
24374	J.D.	Hey how come Elliot never invites us over to her hospital?
24375	Carla	She probably doesn't want you guys embarrassing her.
24376	Turk	How would we embarrass her?
24377	Carla	Oh, maybe by diagnosing all your female patients with "Turk fever."
24378	Turk	Honey, a lot of women suffer from that.
24379	J.D.	It's true. I even had it.
24380	Carla	Or that stupid Siamese twin thing you do?
24381	Turk	You mean multi-ethnic Siamese doctor? Bite, please!
24382	J.D.	Here it is.
24383	Turk	Mmmm.
24384	J.D.	Mmmm. That's headed right to our joint colon.
24385	Carla	Yeah, I think I've made my point.
24386	J.D.	So tell me something, Carla, has she invited you to her new hospital?
24387	Turk and J.D.	Hmmmm?
24388	J.D.	Victory sip!
24389	Turk	Ahhh.
24390	Dr. Cox	Daphne, ketchup!
24391	Jordan	Is this seat taken?
24392	Dr. Kelso	Ketchup is for winners, Ted.
24393	Dr. Cox	Jordan, you have to make other friends in this place. For the love of God, the only respite I get from you is when we're making love and I pretend you're someone else.
24394	Jordan	Yeah, I usually pretend we're doing something else.
24395	Dr. Kelso	Damn it!
24396	Jordan	I am your new friend, so suck it.
24397	J.D.	I gotta go talk to my boys.
24398	Carla	Oh, and I have to go talk to Elliot.
24399	Turk	No wait, don't leave me!
24400	Jordan	So, I hear you and the wife are trying for a boy. Little tip: the night that Perry and I conceived Jack, he was on top, it was about three days before my ovulation, yeah. Oh, and he was choking me! GHKHKH! Oh, it was good.
24401	Turk	Oookay. I'm just...
24402	J.D.	My boys need some ketchup!That's a lot of boys. Rex gets first dibs because I opened his chest with a buzz saw.
24403	Elliot	J.D., ketchup!I gotta get back to my hospital.
24404	Carla	I was thinking I'd come by there and visit you tomorrow.
24405	Elliot	Tomorrow's not great, but we'll definitely do it sometime. You know, um, in the future, heh.
24406	Carla	So, we were out having Mexican food and drinking margaritas
24407	Elliot	Carla? What are you doing here?.
24408	Carla	Hey, Elliot! Let me just finish telling them the story. We were at this tiny little ATM machine...
24409	Elliot	Ugh. I knew I shouldn't have had that chimichanga. I have to, you know...
24410	Carla	Hmm?
24411	Elliot	Fff-fff.
24412	Carla	Oh. Well go for it. There's mostly guys here, they'll never think it was you.
24413	Guy In Line	I think that blonde girl just farted.
24414	Carla	Remember that, Elliot?
24415	Elliot	Yeah. I remember. Ha ha.
24416	Ted	Those two new nurses have wonderful breasts.
24417	Todd	Hey! They have names!Tina, Marge, Sloppy and Mr. Snuggles.
24418	Laverne	Sloppy's bigger than Mr. Snuggles.
24419	Jordan	What are you guys talking about?
24420	Turk	Oh, we were just...Guess they all had someplace to be!
24421	Jordan	Just go!
24422	Turk	Okay!
24423	Patient	Hey! If you feel like talking, I've got a dandy conversation starter. I have had someone else's fingers in four, count 'em, four different orifices...today.
24424	Jordan	Oh! Must be your birthday.
24425	J.D.	OK, gang I'll meet you up in radiology to talk about Mr. Heath's CAT scan. His tumor's getting so big it's starting to look like a three-mor.
24426	Janitor	Not funny.
24427	J.D.	Have you been following me around all day dressed like an intern?
24428	Janitor	Yes, and you're a terrible teacher. I'm not prepared to operate on anyone.
24429	J.D.	Whatever. If it wasn't funny, why did they all laugh?
24430	Janitor	Wake up and smell the third-floor urinal I haven't cleaned in four years. Everybody kisses the ass of the person above them.
24431	Dr. Kelso	I was going to be a cardiologist, but I didn't have the heart.
24432	Doctor	I was going to be a psychiatrist, but I was a-Freud!Oh, yeah.
24433	Laverne	I was going to be a doctor, but I didn't have the patients.
24434	Cafeteria worker	I was gonna be a baker, but I couldn't raise the dough.
24435	Homeless Guy	Good one.You know, I was gonna have her bring you some chicken, but it was fowl.
24436	Janitor	You get it now? Your relationship with your interns is a sham.
24437	J.D.	That dog just laughed at a pun.
24438	Patient	Ooh, not gonna lie, that hurts. Not gonna lie, that hurts. Tell me about your kid.
24439	Jordan	Oh, how did you know I was a mom?
24440	Patient	As a parent myself, I can read the signs, you know? And let us not forget the understated coffee mug we're carrying.
24441	Jordan	Ah.
24442	Turk	How do I know that guy?
24443	Dr. Cox	Maybe you used to date him.
24444	Turk	Oh, that's so clever. I'm gay! Wow. That's good.
24445	Dr. Cox	I'm tired. Maybe he's from the International Pretentious Association and he's here to remove your goatee.
24446	Jordan	So, what do you have? A boy or a girl?
24447	Patient	I have a little girl. I don't get to see her often enough. See, um...I don't know, a few years ago I had a little, business problem.
24448	Jordan	What was your business?
24449	Patient	Import-export. Yeah, I would import heroin into my bloodstream. I would export vomit, urine in, uh, whatever alley would have me as a guest.
24450	Jordan	Oh, sorry. That's the little smile I get when I'm silently judging someone.
24451	Patient	Anyway, the thing is, it's Jenny's sixth birthday on Monday, and uh, I'm not really sure that I can fly out and make it. It's uh, it's hard to get a job. You know, money's tight. I've got hospital bills that I can't pay.
24452	Jordan	Sam, I am so sorry.
24453	Patient	Yeah...
24454	Turk	I know who he is!
24455	Elliot	Just one little problem...
24456	Patient	OH MY GOD, just give me the drugs, 'kay, lady? For God's sake, I've been working you from every possible angle...
24457	Turk	That's the junkie who conned Elliot into giving him meds.
24458	Laverne	Just got interesting, people!
24459	J.D.'s Narration	The Janitor was wrong. My interns weren't laughing at my jokes just because I'm their boss. It made me think about how some people don't want to just open the door......walk in, and see the truth.
24460	Elliot	Why did you come here Carla?
24461	Carla	You're mad at me? Why didn't you want me to come to your job?
24462	Doctor #1	Hey Bankfarter, if you want, we're all going down for lunch.
24463	Elliot	You tell me.
24464	J.D.'s Narration	After all, the truth can reveal the ugliest part of people.
24465	Turk	That guy has conned damn near everyone in this hospital. I've got to warn her.Jordan...whoa!
24466	Dr. Cox	She wanted to work here, so let her see what it's like to work here. And for God's sake, will you be a man?
24467	J.D.'s Narration	As for me, I already knew exactly what the truth was. Plus, my best friend was always around to back me up.
24468	J.D.	How funny is this joke? That patient's tumor is so big, it's starting to look like a three-mor. Huh, huh, huh.
24469	Keith	Three-mor! You are hilarious, Dr. D!
24470	Turk	Awful. It's awful. Awful.
24471	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24472	J.D.'s Thoughts	OK, be cool. They're just kids. Except Gloria. What is her deal?
24473	J.D.	OK, guys, let's talk for a second as equals, all right? Seriously, I'm taking off my stethoscope, and my little name tag, I'm not a doctor right now.
24474	Lisa	You're still wearing scrubs.
24475	Rex	We are in a hospital, man.
24476	J.D.	OK, we're off the property. Now let's talk.
24477	Jason	Shouldn't we wait for Gloria?
24478	Gloria	Coming!
24479	J.D.	We'll catch her up later. Have you guys been fake laughing at my jokes? Be honest. I promise, absolutely no ramifications.
24480	Keith	Well, we've been kind of fake laughing.
24481	J.D.	Keith, I hope you die a violent death and bugs eat your corpse.
24482	Keith	Look! Your jokes kinda suck and when I laugh, you pick me to do procedures.
24483	J.D.	Unbelievable. From now on, there 's absolutely no laughing at my jokes unless they're particularly hysterical! Talk about your mission impossibles, huh, huh, huh, huh.
24484	Janitor	Case closed.
24485	J.D.	What is it with you and the costumes today?
24486	Janitor	I borrowed it from my brother. He's a stripper.
24487	Gloria	I'm I'm here!
24488	J.D.	Gloria.
24489	Elliot	Look, Carla, I didn't want you to come here because, well...Look, there's so much great about you. You're smart, you're loyal, you've absolutely shattered all of my preconceived notions about chicanos.
24490	Carla	Elliot, bring it.
24491	Elliot	You're a bit of a gossip.
24492	Carla	So? I'm interested in people's stories.
24493	Elliot	Thanks to you, for the rest of my career I have the world's worst nickname.
24494	Carla	Bankfarter's not so bad, it sounds German.
24495	Elliot	Don't make fun of my people, Carla!!
24496	Doctor #2	Hey, Bankfarter, did you hear? Charlie found a successful gene therapy for OI. He basically cured the disease.
24497	Elliot	How did he have any time to work when he was always torturing me?!
24498	Doctor #2	Jealousy's an ugly color, Bankfarter. Anyway, we're discontinuing your fellowship.
24499	Elliot	Frick. Frick-frick-frick-frick-frick-frickity-frick-FRICK-FRICK!! Frick.
24500	Jordan	I'm not sure how people go about doing nice things, but here.You should be there for your daughter's birthday.
24501	Sam	I can't take that.
24502	Jordan	Come on. I can't even Botox an ear with this.
24503	Dr. Cox	Oh. Would everyone please watch this? Because nobody, but nobody cries like Sammy. He leads off with the chin quiver...Then he goes right to the look-away.He tries to hold it back but he just can't because there's too much pain!And then, finally, he squeezes out one single tear.Ladies and gentlemen, that is some quality crack-addict theater!
24504	Turk	I can't watch this.
24505	Laverne	Then move your big, bald, biscuit head! Some of us don't have cable.
24506	J.D.	This is a little trust exercise that I really think is gonna connect us again. Remove your blindfolds, please.See your death, see your death, see your death...Keith...Don't worry, buddy. We're cool.
24507	Keith	Really?
24508	J.D.	No! See your death.
24509	Keith	No! But I looked up to you!
24510	J.D.	Hey! Why don't guys go upstairs and do some work!And for God's sake, will somebody wake up Gloria?OK, enough waving. You wave too much. You abuse waving. Go!
24511	Dr. Kelso	There it is, just like I said. I can feel your hatred like a cool spring breeze. Ah!
24512	J.D.'s Thoughts	Gloria.
24513	Elliot	I can't believe I don't have a job!
24514	Carla	Is that even yours?
24515	Elliot	I need your support right now, Carla! Carla, you can not tell Turk and J.D. about this until I get back on my feet again.
24516	Carla	Why? They'll just feel bad for you.
24517	Elliot	No, they'll be merciless. Seriously, if you tell, I will never trust you again with anything.
24518	Dr. Kelso	Where've you been?
24519	Carla	Nowhere!
24520	Dr. Mickhead	What are you doing?
24521	Carla	Nothing!
24522	Janitor	Where's Blonde Doctor?
24523	Carla	Geez!
24524	Laverne	What's the dish?
24525	Carla	I gotta go.
24526	Turk	Hey!
24527	Carla	No hablo inglés!
24528	Turk	Oh my God, you got that little bit of saliva on your lip that says you know something juicy!
24529	Carla	No, I don't.
24530	Turk	Here it comes! YES?
24531	Carla	OK! Here's the scoop!
24532	Turk	Yes! Here is the scoop indeed.
24533	Carla	You gotta promise not to tell.
24534	Turk	I know...
24535	Jordan	Sam, what are you doing back here?
24536	Sam	Hey, lamb chop, uh, crazy story. I was taking a bus to my plane ticket, there was an accident and thank God I'm alive, I hugged him and then......aaargh, rrrroo, ha ha.
24537	Dr. Kelso	Jordan. Ah, this is one of our most famous con-artists-slash-drug-addicts.
24538	Sam	Nice to see you, sir.
24539	Dr. Kelso	You as well. Turkleton! You've dealt with him before.
24540	Sam	Hey, dude.
24541	Dr. Kelso	Why didn't you tell her?
24542	Turk	Because he told me not to!
24543	Dr. Cox	This is gonna cost you.
24544	Turk	Get off my back, I'm not in the mood. Whoa!
24545	J.D.	OK, say it again!
24546	Turk	Get off my back, I'm not in the mood?
24547	J.D.	That's what she said! Zoom, zoom, zoom!
24548	Elliot	OK. I'm sure you know about, go ahead. Take your shots!
24549	Turk	You've got bug-eyes.
24550	J.D.	Just because you dye your mustache blonde doesn't mean it's gone.
24551	Elliot	That's all you have to say?Excuse us.Oh my God, you kept my secret!
24552	Carla	I know! I almost told them, too, but I didn't. Because I love you.
24553	Elliot	Carla, I love you, too!
24554	Carla	Oh, I had to tell Turk something, so you smoke a pipe now.
24555	Elliot	Oh! Coolio!
24556	Carla	What's wrong?
24557	Turk & J.D.	Well...
24558	J.D.	We were gonna do "multi-ethnic Siamese doctor has a Fresca," but then Turk started getting on my case about my interns.
24559	Turk	He's mad because they're sucking up to him and I was saying, "Dude, that's the exact same thing you did with Dr. Cox."
24560	J.D.	You know what? Put our right hand in front of your face. Now talk to it!
24561	Elliot	J.D., he's right. If you want to be a jerk attending too, go ahead. But don't do it because they resent you. That's not fair.
24562	Turk	Dude, get up, I gotta go to the bathroom.
24563	J.D.'s Narration	As I stood up to go to the men's room with Turk, praying he only had to go one-sies, I thought about the different methods people use to teach.
24564	Dr. Cox	Oh, uh, I wasn't sure if you wanted to give him more money, or skip the middleman all together and actually give him narcotics. So I went ahead and brought your ATM card and a, uh, heroin sandwich.It's not heroin. It's smoked turkey.
24565	Jordan	So, you thought if you made me look like a fool, I'd quit. Is that it?
24566	Carla	So, Jordan, I heard Sam got you. Don't worry, he totally suckered me once.
24567	Laverne	When I first started, I lent my car to a patient to go pick up her kid. Last time I ever saw that IROC. Hm.
24568	Turk	Remember that meningitis patient that stole your identity?
24569	J.D.	Darryl! He's cool. From now on he's only going to use my credit card for emergencies!
24570	Dr. Cox	It's a rite of passage that you have to go through around here to be accepted.
24571	Jordan	Oh, my God, you actually did something nice for me!
24572	Dr. Cox	No, no. No-no-no-no-no-no-no. It was a selfish act. If other people talk to you, you won't have to talk to me!
24573	Jordan	Cute.
24574	J.D.'s Narration	I think it's always easier to be a jerk than a good guy.
24575	Keith	Did we do something wrong Dr. Dorian?
24576	J.D.	No, you guys are fine. You're doing a good job.
24577	J.D.'s Narration	Still, good guy or not, there's no reason why you shouldn't enjoy the perks.
24578	J.D.	You know what? I want the laughter back!And you know what, I liked it when you waved, you were always waving...Why don't all of you just wave? All right.
24579	J.D.'s Narration	Ultimately, you can deal with anything, as long as you have a group of friends around to go through it all with you.
24580	Jordan	Hey, guys. What's going on?
24581	J.D.'s Narration	I can't imagine what it would be like if I were all on my own.
24582	Elliot	Excuse me, um, could I just borrow your help-wanted section? Thank you.
24583	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24584	J.D.'s Narration	Since I was currently homeless, Turk and Carla were letting me crash here as long as I needed.
24585	Carla	J.D., you have to get out. This place is tiny and I'm sick of seeing your man-panties hanging all over the bathroom.
24586	J.D.	They're called boxers, Carla.
24587	Carla	They're satin, J.D.
24588	J.D.	With a breathable cotton crotch panel.
24589	J.D.'s Thoughts	King me!
24590	Elliot	Ugh, I need to find someone to split the rent at my place.
24591	Turk	I thought you were getting good money at your new fellowship.
24592	Elliot	So first, I lose my fellowship because some jackass cures the disease, and now the only job I can get is working at this crappy free clinic for eight bucks an hour. No one's life could be worse than mine.Uh, the fellowship's great.
24593	Elliot's Thoughts	Oh God, Carla, please don't tell them I'm working at a free clinic!
24594	Carla's Thoughts	I sense she doesn't want me to tell them. Women have an unspoken connection men can't even fathom.
24595	J.D.'s	Thoughts: Dude, I know you can't look because Carla's here, but you're missing a crazy Victoria's Secret commercial.
24596	Turk's Thoughts	I'm watching Giselle in my spoon right now!
24597	Turk	You know, you you two could solve both of your problems if you just moved in together.
24598	Elliot	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa and whoa...
24599	J.D.	Whoa, hold your horses.
24600	Elliot	We have a very complicated past.
24601	J.D.	I I hurt her and I'm not very proud.
24602	J.D.'s Thoughts	I'm a little proud.
24603	Elliot	We've managed to restore our friendship by staying away from dangerous topics.
24604	J.D.	You know, relationships and things of that nature.
24605	Elliot	J.D. and I keep it superficial.
24606	J.D.	Love the superficial. Dynamite teeth today.
24607	Elliot	Oh, thanks, buddy!
24608	J.D.	Sparkly!
24609	Elliot	Yeah!
24610	Carla	Fine, you can't live with Elliot, but you're not living with us, so get your crap out by Friday.
24611	J.D.	Friday?
24612	Carla	Friday.
24613	J.D.	Friday's my birthday! I've already e-vited everyone over to our place.
24614	Carla	Whose place?
24615	J.D.	Your place. Look I can't just un-e-vite everyone, I've already gotten two e-yeses and twenty-four e-maybes. That's a lot of e-sponses.
24616	Carla	Bambi, I'm gonna put my e-foot up your ass.
24617	J.D.	It's a Mexican-themed fiesta on the first anniversary of my 29th birthday. That means I'm turning 30. Donde? 56 Walnut Drive. Cuando? Thank you for asking. Ocho-thirty until upside-down question mark. Sombreros at the door. Arrrrrrrrrooo!
24618	Turk	I'll be there.
24619	J.D.	Gracias, amigo. I borrowed one of your dictionaries.
24620	J.D.'s Narration	Since there were twelve surgical residents at Sacred Heart fighting for four attending spots, Turk was ass-kissing the senior staff.
24621	Dr. Wen	Oh, damn. I left my briefcase upstairs.
24622	Turk	Excuse me a second.
24623	J.D's Narration	Turk thought he was the only one who heard that.
24624	Turk	Dr. Wen! Dr. Wen, I've got your brI had no idea there were that many Asian surgeons in this hospital.
24625	Todd	I got your back, T-dog.
24626	Turk	Then let it begin.Quit fooling around with those guys and get down here!
24627	Todd	Yaaahhh! Here comes the big dog!
24628	Turk	Dude, thanks for having my back.
24629	Todd	Yeah. Betrayal five.Hey buddy. Betrayal five.
24630	Turk	OHHH!
24631	Todd	Dr. Wen!
24632	Dr. Wen	Oh, my briefcase.
24633	Todd	Yeah.
24634	J.D.	You know, I totally saw that coming.
24635	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24636	Turk	Dude, look at you! Thirty years old! All growed-up.
24637	J.D.	Oh really, Turk? Because the Sacred Heart sign I vandalized last night begs to differ.Hey remember when we were in college we made lists of all the stuff we wanted to do by the time we turned thirty?
24638	Turk	Yeah.
24639	J.D.	Check it!
24640	Turk	Things to do by thirty: Get married, buy a house, learn the difference between "Senator" and "Congressman." Dude, you haven't done any of these yet.
24641	J.D.	I know, but who cares? I got all the time in the world. I mean I'm only turning thirty.
24642	Kid	Thirty? What's thirty?
24643	J.D.	Where did all of these unsupervised children come from?
24644	Turk	So you wanted to talk to me about your appendectomy, Mrs...Appendectomy? Now that ain't right!
24645	Patient	Look, 15% of all surgical complications are anesthesia-related, so I would like to use hypnosis instead of the traditional anesthesia.
24646	Turk	Well I'd like to sleep with Beyoncé tonight instead of my wife, but that ain't happening either, you know what I'm saying?Tell you what, I'll think about it.My appendectomy patient wants me to use hypnosis instead of anesthesia.
24647	Dr. Cox	Lookit, I'd like to throw it in Gwen Stefani tonight instead of Jordan, but that ain't gonna happen either.
24648	Carla	Dr. Cox!
24649	Turk	Dr. Cox! No! Awful!
24650	Carla	Hypnosis is a very powerful tool. It's helped people with depression and weight loss. It helped me to quit smoking.
24651	Dr. Cox	Hypnosis is for birthday parties and bad Vegas lounges. Now you go tell your patient to let you do what you do best. Knock her out and then start digging around inside of her like a blind man looking for a nickel.
24652	Carla	I think you should do it.
24653	Dr. Cox	Knock her out and dig.
24654	Carla	Do it.
24655	Dr. Cox	Dig.
24656	Carla	Do it.
24657	Dr. Cox	Dig.
24658	Carla	Do it.
24659	Dr. Cox	Dig.
24660	Turk	OK. I'm gonna go with Dr. Cox on this one.
24661	Dr. Cox	That's a rookie move and you hate to see it. You always side with the wife, even if she's got a full-blown case of the crazies.
24662	Carla	Turk, we're gonna have kids soon. We're supposed to be a team. That means you occasionally have to listen to me and believe in my opinion. But what if we have a daughter and she wants to get her ears pierced?
24663	Turk	Irrelevant. We're not having a daughter.
24664	Carla	OK, what if we have a son and he wants to take dance class even though all his friends are playing football?
24665	Turk	He can dance if he wants to. He can leave his friends behind. 'Cause his friends don't dance and if they don't dance, then they're no friends of mine! S-S-S-S-A-A-A-A-F-F-F-F-E!
24666	Carla	Then I said, what if our son wants to take dance classes instead of play football with his friends? And Turk ran off singing "Safety Dance."
24667	Elliot	Carla, didn't you learn your lesson that time you told him Der Kommissar was in town?
24668	Carla	Yeah...
24669	Elliot	Ooh! Someone's leaving!
24670	Dr. Cox	Huh.
24671	Carla & Elliot	We saw it first.
24672	Dr. Cox	Jordan, here's the plan. I'm gonna go ahead and cram an entire evening's worth of drinking into the next five minutes. Now, you just make sure not to engage them. Be particularly aware of the blonde, talky one. I've worked with her before. She has no off button.
24673	Carla	If money's so tight, why not have Jake move in with you?
24674	Jordan	Who's Jake?
24675	Dr. Cox	Jordan! No.
24676	Elliot	He's this guy I've been going out with for awhile, but we're not ready to move in. He's a little closed off, you know?
24677	Jordan	Uh, sweetie? Are you aware of who I live with?
24678	Dr. Cox	Jordan Godzilla Sullivan, you stop that, and you stop it now!
24679	Jordan	Why don't you try talking to humans for once? You might enjoy it!
24680	Carla	Elliot, maybe you should be the one to open Jake up. You know, like Turk can be a little immature, you know, like I always have to talk about my feelings over dinner or shut off his iPod during sex. I bet you could do the same thing with Jake.
24681	Dr. Cox	Or, maybe you could pressure him, get dumped, throw on fifty pounds, start collecting knick-knacks and meet your future now, you know, before the loneliness burns too much? Whoaaa-ahahahahaha! Gosh, I did enjoy that!
24682	Turk	Dude, you haven't done anything on this list. How could you never have slept naked on a hammock?
24683	J.D.	I'm afraid of dragonflies. You know what, I'm not gonna make a big deal out of this. Neither one of us has made any headway with our lists.
24684	Turk	First of all, don't lump me in with you, because I'm a surgeon, I'm married, I've had sex while playing Frogger and I'm gonna be a dad. I'm moving through my list.
24685	J.D.	I've done nothing. I mean I did learn another language, but it was just that one where you slid a "b" sound in the middle of every single word, and I was never fluent.
24686	Turk	That secret language was so lame.
24687	J.D.	No-b-t with the la-b-di-b-es...
24688	Turk	Dr. Kelso! Do you have any idea who's gonna get those three attending spots next year?
24689	Dr. Kelso	There are four spots for next year.
24690	Turk	Three, if you're not counting the one going to me!
24691	Dr. Kelso	I'm gonna stick with four, Turkleton. See, there are numerous skilled surgeons here at Sacred Fart.Did you see the sign? Though there will be no vandalism here, people! It was classic. Anyway, the key is to do something that will get noticed.
24692	Turk	I don't know if you know this, but tomorrow I'll be doing an appendectomy using hypnosis instead of anesthesia.
24693	Dr. Kelso	Well, it's about time. Hell's bells, son, when I say the name Turkleton, people laugh.
24694	Turk	Maybe because that's not my name.
24695	Dr. Kelso	Not yet, Turkleton. Not yet.
24696	Jake	Elliot, I don't think I understand what you want.
24697	Elliot	I just want you to open up, you know, emotionally, spiritually.
24698	Jake	Well, I'm not exactly religious, you know, but I do think that God watches over my family and my favorite sports teams. Oh, and once in tenth grade He made Jennifer Martin sleep with me.
24699	Elliot	OK. How about opening up sexually? What's your wildest fantasy?
24700	Jake	Yeah, it's not happening.
24701	Elliot	Come on! Sometimes in bed I feel like I'm the only one screaming.
24702	Jake	Elliot, you're quiet as a mouse. All that screaming is in your head.
24703	Elliot	Yeah, but in there, it's crazy...mmmmmm.
24704	Jake	All right, fine. Why don't you tell me your wildest fantasy?
24705	Elliot	OK, fine. You're a Mexican apple thief, I run the cider house. I catch you hiding behind the stone mill, you chase me into the tasting room. Oh, if there's a crow in there, fine, if not, I can live with it. Anyway, we're all alone, you don't speak a word of English, but you teach me more about hard cider than I ever learned from my fermenting exams and our passion is so loud they can hear it all the way in the distillery...Oh. God, I can be such an apple slut.
24706	Jake	OK.
24707	J.D.	When did we lose Mr. Heath?
24708	Carla	Oh, we didn't, his vitals are fine.
24709	J.D.	Doug, I told you to stop pre-tagging patients.
24710	Doug	It's a slow day in the morgue, nothing's written in stone.
24711	J.D.	You wrote a time of death.
24712	Doug	I wrote one-ish.
24713	J.D.	Get out of here!
24714	Carla	Why are you so pissy?
24715	J.D.	Carla, at 6:41 tomorrow evening I turn thirty. I have to find one thing on this list I can do by then.
24716	Dr. Cox	Maybe you could swing by our parts department and pick up a pair of testes.
24717	J.D.	Haven't you used that joke like, a trillion times?
24718	Dr. Cox	I'm OK with it.
24719	Carla	Invent a cereal? Complete a triathlon?
24720	Dr. Cox	There's a triathlon tomorrow, Thing One and Thing Two have been training vigorously for it.
24721	Doug	We're working on our drafting technique!
24722	Dr. Cox	If your goal is to repel all women on the planet, then it's definitely working.
24723	Ted	Ignoring him...and switch!
24724	J.D.	That's it! I'll do the triathlon!
24725	Carla	Oh, you don't know anything about triathlons!
24726	J.D.	Well, I didn't know anything about cereal-inventing either, Carla. And yet if it wasn't for a harshly-worded cease and desist letter, we'd all be eating J.D.'s Bananas and Nuts.
24727	Carla	You're not serious about this, are you?
24728	J.D.	Why is everybody wearing wetsuits?
24729	Doug	Because the water's like 49 degrees, dum-dum.
24730	Ted	So what's your best time, buster?
24731	J.D.	Honestly, Ted, it doesn't really matter. As long as I finish by 6:41 tonight.
24732	J.D.'s Narration	The harder you push yourself to do something, the harder it is to back out. Whether you're caught in a lie with your wife...
24733	Carla	I heard you were doing the hypnosis surgery. You actually listened to me.
24734	Turk	Hell yeah, I listened to you, baby! Come on. That's the reason I'm doing it right? Because of you and how well I listen.
24735	Carla	I love you.
24736	Turk	Love you.
24737	J.D.'s Narration	Or whether you're just trying to get your boyfriend to open up.
24738	Elliot	Come on, Jake, come in there and show me what you're really like. No one is going to judge you.Oh my God, Jake!
24739	Jake	You want to talk about it, Elliot?
24740	Elliot	Nope!
24741	J.D.'s Narration	And sometimes, the only thing you can do is just dive in.
24742	J.D.	Ooh! Oh boy, that's cold! Oh God! Ahh! There's a little, here's some more, all right, ease it in, ease it in!
24743	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24744	J.D.'s Narration	As I sidestroked through the salty waters of the great Pacific...
24745	J.D.'s Thoughts	Pick an apple, put it in your pocket. Pick an apple, put it in your pocket...
24746	J.D's Narration	...I wondered if everyone was doing as well as I was.
24747	Turk	Why are all these cameras here?
24748	Dr. Kelso	Turkleton, this is quite the event here at Sacred Fart.I can't help it, it kills me. Yeah, we got visiting doctors, video crews, even that Japanese news anchor who slept with me when I convinced her I was an oil tycoon. If she comes over here, my name is T-Bone.
24749	Dr. Cox	We're also getting a good bit of interest from the seismologist at Cal Tech who, I understand, will be able to chart the magnitude of the scream emanating from your hypnosis patient, as well as, of course, the numerous after-screams that are sure to follow.
24750	Turk	No interviews!
24751	Carla	Turk. Turk! Where are you going?
24752	Turk	I can't do this. I don't believe in any of this hypnotism crap! I only needed to impress Kelso!
24753	Carla	Oh, so great, you lied to me!
24754	Turk	I'm about to ruin my career by plunging a knife into a completely conscious person! But you know what? You're absolutely right. Let's focus on the lying.
24755	J.D.'s Narration	As I reached the biking stage and finally realized what chafing was, I got a surprise visitor.
24756	Elliot	How's it going?
24757	J.D.	Well, my bike is rusty, I haven't been able to feel my genitals since they first touched water, and the only thing I've had to eat all day is half a jellyfish. Why are you here?
24758	Elliot	Can I talk to you about Jake?
24759	J.D.	That's a dangerous topic, talk to Carla.
24760	Elliot	Yeah, any time I talk to Carla about a guy, she tells me to marry him so the four of us can go to dinner together.
24761	Intern	I've been dating this guy for a few weeks, but I just found out he went on a gay cruise last month.
24762	Carla	Probably a cheap trip. Marry him and the four of us will have dinner.
24763	Intern	But he also said he might be gay.
24764	Carla	Dinner!
24765	J.D.	Talking to you violates the two most important tenets of our relationship. One, keep discussions superficial and two, no talking while my boys are straddling chrome. That one's new.
24766	Elliot	Why don't you just try a higher gear?
24767	J.D.	Agh! It's like pedaling in hummus!
24768	Elliot	See you, buddy!
24769	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, thank God, I think the bike part is finally over. Oh no.
24770	J.D.	Whoooooooaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!!! Whoaahhh OOF!
24771	Janitor	I can play with signs, too!
24772	Turk	This is great. I'm being assisted by a magician.
24773	Carla	The only way you're going to get through this is if you believe it's going to work.
24774	Turk	Yeah.
24775	Carla	OW!!
24776	Turk	That was just a fingernail, honey, how would you like it if I cut out your appendix?!
24777	Carla	Let's just forget for one second that hypnosis is used to lower bleeding, help recovering patients deal with pain. You are married now. So start believing what I tell you to believe.And don't pinch me!
24778	J.D.'s Narration	During the run, dehydration set in.
24779	Ted	Hang in there, buddy!
24780	Doug	See you at the luau!
24781	J.D.	They already finished and cooked a pig?
24782	Elliot	Hey, J.D.
24783	J.D.	Oh, you're real. Although the dolphin costume is a little odd.
24784	Elliot	This Jake thing is still really bothering me.
24785	J.D.	Elliot, you know our rules.
24786	Elliot	Yeah, I've been thinking about that. Who wants to have a superficial friendship? And, God, do you remember how close we used to be? Dealing with Dr. Cox,
24787	J.D.	This is working.
24788	Elliot	Not for me, I want to be able to tell you that my boyfriend really freaked me out.
24789	J.D.	Well, if he freaked you out, why don't you and talk to him?
24790	Elliot	I don't know. You tell me.
24791	J.D.	All right, fine, Elliot. You want to know why? You're just like me. You're scared because you feel like you haven't accomplished anything with your life. But instead of running a triathlon, you're pushing forward with a guy you don't belong with. And you know as well as I do that one of these days, he's going to open up a bottle of white wine for you when you really prefer red, except you never told him that and you want to know why? It's because he's not right for you, Elliot. Are you happy now?
24792	Elliot	You're pretty smart for a guy running in bike shoes.
24793	J.D.'s Thoughts	Must. Finish. Race.
24794	Turk	You can do this. You can do this.What are you saying to her?
24795	Hypnotist	You can do this. You can do this.
24796	Turk	Small world. Scalpel. Making first incision.Well, here goes.Hmm? All right. Clamp, please!
24797	J.D.'s Narration	They say that in life, all good things must come to an end. Sometimes it comes quietly...
24798	Elliot	I like red.
24799	Jake	You do?
24800	Elliot	Jake, I think we need to talk.
24801	J.D.'s Narration	...and sometimes, not so quietly.
24802	Turk	Oh-b-no-b..
24803	Hypnotist	You can do this! You can do this! You can do this!
24804	J.D.'s Narration	And suddenly, you realize you've taken something as far as you can go.
24805	Turk	What the hell was I thinking?
24806	Carla	Turk. You did great, baby.
24807	Dr. Kelso	She's right, Turkleton. Hell, without anesthesia you made it halfway through a surgery. I bet you could publish that.
24808	Dr. Cox	Maybe they'll put it in "Almost" magazine.
24809	Dr. Kelso	You know, Perry, it wouldn't hurt you to make some noise around here.
24810	Dr. Cox	How's this? Blow it out your ass, Bob.
24811	Carla	See? My baby made some noise!
24812	Turk	Yeah, I made some noise all right.
24813	Elliot	J.D., what you said before, I knew you were right. Anyway, I'm sorry I got mad.Thanks. You were wrong about one thing, though. We are moving forward.
24814	J.D.	Elliot, I'm thirty years old. I'm single, I'm homeless, and I'm pretty sure I just soiled myself.
24815	Elliot	Why don't you just move into my place?
24816	J.D.	Oh, great. Then we'll be two losers under one roof.
24817	Elliot	By my watch, you've got eight minutes to finish this thing. Come on!
24818	J.D.'s Narration	A wise man once said the human spirit can overcome any obstacle.
24819	J.D.	I can't...
24820	Elliot	Come on.
24821	J.D.'s Narration	That man had obviously never run a triathlon.
24822	Elliot	Come on. Hooooooooorgh! You're not really helping! Rrgh!
24823	Carla	Are you sure this is the finish line?
24824	Turk	I think I see him.
24825	J.D.'s Narration	As for me, I could overcome any obstacle, as long as I had Elliot and her ridiculously strong thighs beneath me.
24826	J.D.	Woo-hoo! We made it! And with two minutes to spare!
24827	J.D. & Elliot	Whoa!
24828	Turk	Baby, I'm not carrying him to the car.
24829	Elliot	Promise to help me get through my thirtieth?
24830	J.D.	Mm-hmm. Will you tell me what Jake's fantasy was?
24831	Elliot	Nope.
24832	J.D.	Did it involve chains?
24833	Elliot	No.
24834	J.D.	Whips?
24835	Elliot	Mm-mm.
24836	J.D.	Candle wax?
24837	Elliot	No.
24838	J.D.	Role-playing?
24839	Elliot	No.
24840	J.D.	Lasers?
24841	Elliot	Mm-mm.
24842	J.D	Hamsters?
24843	Elliot	Negative.
24844	J.D.	Was he a Mexican apple thief?
24845	Elliot	If only.
24846	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24847	J.D.'s Narration	I really missed living with Turk. But living with Elliot wasn't that bad.
24848	Elliot	Hey, roomie! I'm having the girls from my yoga class over for drinks tonight and FYI, Tina, the tiny brunette just got dumped and she's looking for rebound sex. Honestly, how could I be a better roommate?
24849	J.D.'s Thoughts	She could be half Turk and half Elliot.
24850	Turk/Elliot	Hey dog, if you die before me, I'll let you play with my boobies while I finish.
24851	J.D.	I died, Turk-iot. Hellooo!
24852	Elliot	J.D., what are you doing?
24853	J.D.	Nothing.
24854	Elliot	Because it looked like you were thinking about fondling my breasts, and if that's the case, then stop thinking and start fondling.
24855	Turk	Dude, what the hell are you doing?
24856	J.D.	I miss having you as my roommate, I don't know!
24857	Turk	Check it out. Keith's telling Mr. Morrison about his brain tumor.
24858	J.D.'s Narration	Seeing an intern tell someone they're going to die for the first time is strange. Because even though it's a horrible and sad experience, if they get through it, there's a sense of accomplishment.
24859	Keith	Nailed it! Hell yeah!
24860	J.D.	Good job, man. What did you say?
24861	Keith	Well, I just told him that there's nothing more we can do right now.
24862	Turk & J.D.	Ooh!
24863	Keith	What?
24864	J.D.	"Nothing more we can do right now" implies that there maybe something we can do tomorrow.
24865	Keith	Well, I also said that we'd make him as comfortable as possible.
24866	Turk	Sounds like someone's going to get new pillows and a comforter.
24867	Keith	That man knows he's doomed!
24868	J.D.	Yeah, I'm gonna need you to go back in there and use some form of the word "die." Dead, dying, deadsies, deadwood. Your choice.
24869	Keith	What was the middle one?
24870	J.D.	Deadsies.
24871	Turk	Deadwood?
24872	J.D.	Did you know cowboys used to curse?
24873	Turk	I didn't know that.
24874	Ted	Gather round, people, Dr. Kelso has an announcement to make!
24875	Dr. Kelso	That'll be all, Ted. You can go back to doing whatever you were doing.
24876	Ted	It was my day off.
24877	Dr. Kelso	Due to lack of funds, I'm shutting down our baby-mobile, which means there will no longer be free prenatal care for underprivileged women. Bottom line, if you're thinking about knocking up a homeless gal, I'd do it this weekend.Thank you, Colonel Doctor.
24878	Colonel Doctor	Excuse me?
24879	Dr. Kelso	I'm sorry, I don't know your name and you look like that Kentucky Fried Chicken guy. Moving on. This Friday I am receiving an award from the A.M.A.
24880	Dr. Cox	"Jerk-off of the Year." No, "Bastard of the year." Ah, don't you tell me, "Guy I Despise So Much I'd Pay Someone To Kill You and Stuff You and Leave You By My Bed So That When I Wake Up In the Morning, I Can Roll Over and Punch You in the Face...of...the Year."
24881	Dr. Kelso	And, we're back. Anyway, I need one of you attendings to introduce me at the dinner, so figure it out.
24882	J.D.	How do we handle this?
24883	Dr. Cox	Same way we have for years.First one who falls introduces Kelso.
24884	J.D.	Unfortunately for you guys, I have the balance of a...
24885	J.D.'s Thoughts	Careful, you're about to let Dr. Cox know you were a gymnast in high school.
24886	J.D.	Fine. Let's do this. Wheels up.OK, come on Dorian. Find your center. Round the rosy! Hey! I got it! I don't got it!Whoa. Whoa. Reel it in, Take it clockwise, fight your fear!Come on. Come on. Be the chair. You gotta want it Johnny D! You gotta want it! Woooooo!!
24887	Dr. Cox	Oh! Tough break, there, Newbie.Group! Position right...Ho!I don't know, but I believe...
24888	Doctors	I don't know, but I believe...
24889	Dr. Cox	Newbie's going to...
24890	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24891	J.D.	So, I have to introduce Dr. Kelso. Big whoop.
24892	Dr. Cox	I don't think you understand the predicament you are in here. Kelso expects a long, glowing testimonial. The kind that make men cheer and women...What is that women do, Newbie?
24893	J.D.	How the hell would I know?
24894	J.D.'s Thoughts	They swoon.
24895	Dr. Cox	Look, if you get up there and start kissing Kelso's ass, your fellow attendings will forever think of you as a brown-nosing toadie. On the other hand, if you don't pucker up, Kelso will make your life a living hell. You're officially trapped.
24896	J.D.	I'll just say something nice about him that's actually true.
24897	Dr. Cox	You go do that, and I'll go find God, quit drinking, get in touch with myself emotionally and we'll meet right back here at half past impossible. OK?
24898	J.D.	Everyone has a human side, Coxy. Even Kelso.
24899	Laverne	The hell he does. I remember a flu epidemic. He lost half a dozen children in one day. Hmm!The second Kelso's foot hits the bottom of those stairs, he doesn't have a care in the world.
24900	J.D.	You know, Laverne, I'm a doctor. So I'm not really gonna take my psychological evaluations from someone who dispenses them in between watching "Maury" and eating a corn muffin.
24901	J.D.'s Thoughts	OK, that was too mean. Apologize.
24902	J.D.	Laverne, I...
24903	J.D.'s Thoughts	Ah, the hell with it. She's not gonna forgive you, go for broke!
24904	J.D.	I was watching CNN earlier. Apparently the terror alert in your armpits has been elevated to orange. Oh, no he didn't. Yes, Laverne, he did.
24905	Janitor	"Laverne, I'm a doctor." You're a bit of a know it all, aren't you?
24906	J.D.	Well, I know a lot.
24907	Janitor	Yeah? Who was Deep Throat?
24908	J.D.	Mark Felt, the F.B.I. guy. That's been all over the news for months.
24909	Janitor	Oh, sorry, rich boy. My TV doesn't get the news. Just the bible channel and some kind of Chinese boxing. I bet you don't know how to play Jiggly Ball.
24910	J.D.	That's because there's no such thing.
24911	Janitor	Ha ha! I knew you didn't know.
24912	J.D.'s Narration	I knew if I just followed Dr. Kelso around for a little while, he'd eventually do something decent. I'm a master of stealth. I could sneak up on anybody.
24913	Dr. Kelso	Why are you following me?
24914	J.D.	Sir, aren't you being a little paranoid?
24915	Dr. Kelso	I was in Nam, you know. They pulled off my fingernails.
24916	J.D.	When did you get an earring?
24917	Dr. Kelso	Enid, I'm not cheating on you, this earring is mine.See?It's a hip-hop world, son. Keep up or get out of the way.
24918	J.D.	I've got to get an earring.Turk, have you heard of Jiggly Ball?
24919	Turk	Yeah, it's a game the orderlies made up.
24920	J.D.	I've heard of it, too. It's so awesome that we've both heard of it.
24921	Turk	Yes, that that's awesome.Mr. Keck, what do you say we get you into surgery and take care of that hernia!
24922	Mr. Keck	Um, I don't know if surgery is necessary. Last night, I was in pain so I went to a free clinic. The doctor there said surgery wasn't my only option.
24923	Turk	Well, you're just going to have to get him on the phone and tell him that I won't be second opinioned by a clinic doctor who couldn't carry my jock strap! Give me some!
24924	J.D.	Here it is!
24925	Turk	Ho!
24926	Elliot	Yeah, I think I know this guy. Is he a cocky, black doctor with a white doctor following him around and looking at him like he's in love?
24927	J.D.	You'd make a pretty girl.
24928	Mr. Keck	Yeah.
24929	Elliot	All right, now repeat after me...
24930	Mr. Keck	You can't decide for me, that's not your duty.
24931	Elliot	And are they both trying not to laugh at word "duty?"
24932	Mr. Keck	Yeah. Hey, Heckle and Jeckle, you know what? No surgery.
24933	Turk	Who the hell is this?
24934	Male Voice on Phone	Where are my shoelaces?
24935	Elliot	I said to tell him that he had a laxity in the peritoneal wall and that surgery was unnecessarily invasive, was that so hard?
24936	Dr. Cox	Mr. Morrison, I understand that one of our interns spent an hour in here telling you over and over that you were going to die. I would make him apologize personally, but I'm having him spend the rest of the day checking that counter top's heartbeat.
24937	Keith	Sorry, Mr. Morrison
24938	Dr. Cox	Keith! I think Mr. Countertop would really appreciate your undivided attention.Now, the hospital is running an experimental drug trial on a medication that they're hoping will reduce the size of tumors. Well, I'm gonna try my hardest to get you in there.
24939	Mr. Morrison	I really appreciate that, sir.
24940	J.D.	Ahh, checking Mr. Countertop's heart rate.Memories. Did you know that once Dr. Cox had me give every air conditioning unit in this hospital a pap smear? The wacky thing was, room 403 did have some yeast issues.Oh, Dr. Cox, this intro is killing me. Have you seen Kelso?
24941	Dr. Cox	Nope. But, our new patient, Mr. Franks, in here is crazy rich, so I'd imagine big Bob will be here momentarily to make love to his money clip
24942	Dr. Kelso	Hi. Bob Kelso.Listen up, bozos. That gentleman over there is basically a cash piñata waiting to be whacked open. So how about someone diagnoses him so I can get my candy.
24943	Dr. Cox	I'll be glad to do it, Bob, if you'll do me a favor and put my patient, Mr. Morrison, in that experimental drug trial.
24944	Dr. Kelso	Sure, what the hell.
24945	Dr. Cox	Deal.
24946	J.D.'s Thoughts	Finally, I had something I could say in my speech. Dr. Kelso was an angel.
24947	Elliot	Look, Lorraine, the sooner you let me have a look at that rash, the sooner we can get you back home...I mean, back on the street, which is your home. Hey, home street home, huh? I'm sorry, Lorraine, that was incredibly insensitive.Frick!
24948	J.D.	So this is where germs are born...
24949	Elliot	I can not believe that you told these guys!
24950	Turk	Elliot, she didn't. My patient told me that his clinic doctor was this blonde-haired woman who talked so fast and in such a high-pitched voice when she was upset her words eventually became gibberish.
24951	Elliot	I really do not talk like that. I'm getting pretty tired of you guys constantly saying...
24952	Carla	Elliot, sweetie, nobody but me can understand you.That's just Turk. You know that's how he is.
24953	J.D.	You knew she worked here? I can't believe you kept a secret. Remember before your wedding when you sold me out to Turk?
24954	Carla	J.D., you showed up drunk at my shower screaming through tears that I'd never be as emotionally connected to him as you are.
24955	J.D.	Turk knew I was joking.
24956	J.D.'s Thoughts	Because we're so emotionally connected.
24957	Turk	Elliot, nobody respects clinic doctors.
24958	Elliot	Really, Turk? I think your hernia patient does.
24959	Turk	I'm not upset about that!
24960	Carla	It's obvious you are.
24961	J.D.	It's more obvious to me, baby. I mean, Turk.
24962	Elliot	Look, I know this place isn't the greatest, but it's not like I lie awake thinking about being yelled at by Dr. Cox and playing Jiggly Ball with the orderlies.
24963	J.D.'s Thoughts	How do I not know about this game?
24964	Elliot	At this clinic I get to practice medicine for people who really need me. I mean, honestly, I feel like I belong here.
24965	Orderly	Dr. Kool just got stabbed in the parking lot and we're all out of gauze. Is it cool if I take lunch?
24966	Elliot	This place is crushing my soul.
24967	J.D.	Can you believe Elliot's working at a free clinic?
24968	Dr. Cox	Who?
24969	J.D.	Dr. Reid?
24970	Dr. Cox	I'm sorry, that's just not ringing a bell.
24971	Carla	She and J.D. used to sleep together.
24972	Dr. Cox	J.D.?
24973	J.D.	That's not even funny.
24974	Dr. Cox	Priscilla, I honestly, on my mother's grave, thought your real name was Carol.
24975	Carla	Whoa, whoa, you want to hear a weird coincidence? The pathology just came back on Dr. Kelso's rich patient. He has the same brain tumor as your guy, Mr. Morrison.
24976	J.D.'s Narration	I don't know why we were running. Because I think we both knew that we couldn't change anything. Because given a choice between a rich guy and a poor guy, it was pretty obvious who Bob Kelso would put in the drug trial and who he'd leave behind.Another banner day at Sacred Heart.A best friend stuck in crappy job...A nice guy slowly dying without a fighting chance...It's a wonder how anyone can walk out of this place with a smile on their face.
24977	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24978	Carla	We have to help Elliot get her job back.
24979	Turk	Honey, there's no money to hire another attending.
24980	J.D.	Maybe though, Dr. Bailey was fired last night.
24981	Carla	Why?
24982	Dr. Bailey	For this procedure, I'm going to have to numb you. "Num-num-num-num-num..."
24983	Turk	You know, in Dr. Bailey's defense
24984	Carla	No, no, no, no, no.
24985	J.D.	There have been times
24986	Carla	No.So anyways, we figure, if I offer to do the nursing schedules and these guys volunteer to do extra shifts at the clinic, Dr. Kelso might give you your job back.
24987	Elliot	No, thanks.
24988	Carla	Why?
24989	Elliot	Carla, I can't do your paperwork, I am swamped.
24990	Carla	I got you your job back.
24991	Elliot	Turk, I am not giving you my last tater tot!
24992	Turk	I got you your job back.
24993	Elliot	J.D., I don't care if they're able to successfully attach one person's limbs on to another person's body, I am not giving you my hands.
24994	J.D.	Job back.It's just a beautiful film. Beautiful. Corn?Oh, let me help you. I got it.You're tickling your hands. Wait, stop, you're tickling your hands.
24995	Elliot	Buttery!
24996	J.D.	OK, keep going, I enjoy it, actually.Ah, I'm only two and a half years away from chest hands.
24997	Elliot	I have to handle this on my own, OK?
24998	J.D.	See? These are chest hands.
24999	Turk	That's what I'm talking about.
25000	J.D.	Course, yours would be brown.
25001	J.D.'s Narration	The next day started poorly. I only had eight hours until Kelso's awards dinner and someone else was boxing me out.
25002	Dr. Cox	Hey, Bob, I need to talk to you about my drug trial patient.Ah, we lost him.Bob? I can see you.Oh, for God's sake, you're three-dimensional.
25003	Turk	It's true, Mr. Keck, you can probably get by without the surgery. But why would you? I'm the smartest, most skilled surgeon in this place.
25004	Mr. Keck	Are you stuck in that candy machine?
25005	Turk	I paid for my Rolos, I'm getting my Rolos!
25006	Mr. Keck	Mm-hmm.
25007	Carla	Nice! Why aren't you mocking him?
25008	J.D.	Dropped a quarter in here.
25009	Carla	Guys, listen. We really need to help Elliot.
25010	Turk	Baby, she said she doesn't want to be helped.
25011	Carla	If J.D. were drowning and he told you he didn't want you to save him, wouldn't you do it?
25012	Turk	That depends. What if there are hot chicks at the pool? Maybe he wants one of them to jump in and save him.
25013	Carla	Let's say there's no women.
25014	Turk	There's always women at the pool, baby.
25015	Carla	Fine, he's in a pond.
25016	J.D.	Oh, I would never swim in a pond, they're infamous for serpents.
25017	Turk	You could swim at the Y on Tuesdays. Men only.
25018	J.D.	Have you been to the Y on man night? Not me.
25019	Carla	OK, fine! Turk's the one who's drowning.
25020	Turk	Oh, so now a brother can't swim!
25021	J.D.	Why do you have to go there?
25022	Carla	Oh my God! I would rather play Jiggly Ball than try to explain this to you two idiots.
25023	J.D.'s Thoughts	She's the idiot. We're doctors.
25024	Dr. Cox	Bob, I'm physically touching your arm now. Oh, come on, I know you're here.
25025	Dr. Kelso	Oh, hi, Perry, what can I do for you?
25026	Dr. Cox	Anyway, I just wanted to introduce you to our chief of medicine.
25027	Mr. Morrison	Sir, I can't tell you how well everyone's treating me.
25028	Dr. Kelso	That's what we're here for.
25029	Dr. Cox	You, uh, you forgot to tell him you were bumping him from the drug trial.
25030	Dr. Kelso	I've got work to do, Perry.
25031	Dr. Cox	You're not going anywhere.
25032	Dr. Kelso	Are you hearing that?
25033	J.D.	What kind of glass is this?Ow?
25034	Dr. Kelso	There was one spot open in the study. I gave it to the rich guy because with the money he's now donating, I can reopen the prenatal unit.
25035	Dr. Cox	What really bothers me is that you can look in there at John Morrison, a guy that you essentially gave a death sentence to, and just not care.
25036	Dr. Kelso	It's not my job to care, Perry.
25037	J.D.	Can I talk to you for a second?
25038	Janitor	No, I'm busy cleaning.That one always kills.
25039	J.D.	Do you remember earlier when I told you I'd never heard of Jiggly Ball? I was joking. I play all the time.
25040	Janitor	I like this. It's an idiot handle.
25041	J.D.	Get off.
25042	Janitor	As it happens, we're heading out right now to play some Jiggly Ball. Are you in?
25043	J.D.'s Thoughts	Just say no!
25044	J.D.	Jiggle me in.
25045	Janitor	All right, you're gonna go first. Please enter the Jiggly circle.Everybody else, on my signal prepare to throw.
25046	J.D.	Throw?
25047	Janitor	Now.Now, anyone who caught a Jiggle rebound, may step up to the Death Line.
25048	Laverne	I want you to think of this as a corn muffin.
25049	J.D.	Oh!There is no such thing as Jiggly Ball, is there?
25050	Janitor	No.
25051	J.D.	Guys, why?
25052	Carla	The Janitor told us that if we pretended to know about Jiggly Ball, we'd get to throw tennis balls at you.
25053	Turk	And I couldn't pass it up, dude!
25054	Elliot	I got my shift covered!
25055	J.D.	I could see where it would be funny from the outside of the circle.
25056	Ted	YAAAAAHHHHH!!
25057	J.D.	AAH!!
25058	Ted	Hey, Kelso's leaving for his award thing, so if you want to talk to him about Dr. Reid, do it now.
25059	Elliot	I told you guys to leave it alone.
25060	Carla	Would you stop being so proud?
25061	Elliot	I'm proud? Carla, after the wedding you wouldn't even take Turk's name.
25062	Carla	I use it for official things.
25063	Elliot	Letting him call you Mrs. Turk in the bedroom isn't official.
25064	Turk	But it is officially hot!
25065	Elliot	And Turk, you freaked out when the hernia patient listened to me over you, and J.D., you just let the entire hospital pummel you with tennis balls because you were too proud to admit you didn't know what Jiggly Ball was.
25066	J.D.	I think there may be something wrong with my spine, because I'm not doing that.
25067	Carla	Elliot, look, we just care about you.
25068	Elliot	Yeah, well, don't worry about it. I'll get back on top on my own.
25069	Dr. Kelso	Chop-chop, Dorian.
25070	J.D.'s Narration	Even though I had no clue what I was going to say, Elliot's attitude inspired me to introduce the hell out of Bob Kelso.
25071	J.D.	Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Bob Kelso is...
25072	Dr. Kelso	Thank you, Dr. Dorian. Thank you so much for this award. I'm delighted to see you all...
25073	Dr. Cox	Did I say he wanted a long introduction? Because Kelso just he just likes it when people say his name. Hope you didn't obsess too much about that, Newbie.
25074	J.D.'s Narration	Over the next few weeks, I couldn't help thinking about what I had planned to say in my speech. And about how pride defines who we are.
25075	Orderly	This guy has an STD and he definitely doesn't want his wife to find out.
25076	Dr. Kelso	Crap.
25077	J.D.'s Narration	As far as Bob Kelso goes, I know some of the good things he does are for the wrong reasons.
25078	Dr. Kelso	I'd like everyone to welcome back Dr. Reid.
25079	J.D.'s Narration	Still, I also know that I wouldn't want to have to make any of the decisions that he makes.
25080	J.D.	But when all is said and done, I like to think he does care a little.
25081	J.D.'s Narration	Even if he's too proud to show it.
25082	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
25083	J.D.'s Narration	After four years, I know the hospital so well I can sneak in a little nap walk before rounds.
25084	J.D.'s Thoughts	Two quick steps to the left to avoid Overly-Ambitious Orderly.Hop over the dead guy Doug's dragging because he lost his gurney again.
25085	Doug	The man's dead, J.D. Show some respect.
25086	J.D.'s Thoughts	And finally, Dr. Kelso's 9AM wrong shoulder tap.
25087	Dr. Kelso	Dammit. Every morning, tapping. No one's ever there!
25088	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, you can't be ready for everything.
25089	Janitor	Hey! Help me move this weekend.
25090	J.D.'s Thoughts	We scoff......And we walk away.
25091	Dr. Cox	Remind me again why you're having our son baptized.
25092	Jordan	Oh, what do you care? You're not even going.
25093	Dr. Cox	Fine, let him go to church. I mean, I let him go to magic shows, I'll just tell him it's all a lie when he gets home so he doesn't have any of those crazy nightmares.
25094	Jordan	By the way, I invited your sister.
25095	Dr. Cox	Jordan, please tell me you didn't.
25096	Jordan	Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie, I didn't realize you'd be so upset. I'll call her and tell her not to come. Ha ha! How weird would it be if I was like that?
25097	Carla	Totally.
25098	Jordan	Weird.
25099	J.D.	When is this joyous occasion?
25100	Dr. Cox	You're not invited.
25101	J.D.	Oh, I see. Family only, everyone, that's how they're doing it.
25102	Carla	I'm going.
25103	Dr. Cox	Newbie, give me a break. Of course you're going. As a matter of fact, I'd I'd like you to be the boy's godfather.
25104	J.D.	I am honored.
25105	Dr. Cox	I am lying.
25106	J.D.	I'm not sure I see how that's funny.
25107	Elliot	Uh, what's with the second beeper?
25108	Turk	Carla gave it to me. She's got me on twenty-four hour baby-making alert, and we haven't had sex since her last ovulation. Did you know that women only do that once a month?
25109	J.D.	Of course I knew that, Turk, I'm a doctor.
25110	J.D.'s Thoughts	Once a month? That's crazy!
25111	Elliot	I don't know why I even bother ovulating. Little Haley doesn't have a chance this month. I name my eggs, big frick. Last month, it was Cassie.
25112	J.D.	Ooh, Cassie's pretty.
25113	Elliot	Oh, she would have been, J.D., she would have been.
25114	Dr. Cox	Everyone! This is my sister, Paige. Paige, I'd like you to meet random people I don't care about.
25115	Dr. Kelso	Ahh! Here for the baptism. I remember my son, Harrison's big day. All of us laughing at him in his frilly little baptism dress. Well, we're not laughing anymore, Harrison's a poofter. Bob Kelso.
25116	J.D.	Hi, I'm J.D. I'm sure Perry's spoken of me.
25117	Paige	No...
25118	J.D.	Nothing about taking a talented go-getter under his wing, or being a surrogate father to a boy who's lost his own? Nothing about that at all, I'm surprised. That's interesting to me, but OK.
25119	J.D.'s Thoughts	Don't cry in front of people.
25120	Paige	Perry and I don't talk much.
25121	J.D.	Oh, they don't talk much, everybody. There's no talking in the family.
25122	Dr. Cox	Rest assured, Newbie, even if we did talk from morning till night about all big and tiny things that matter most to me, the big being my son, Jack, cure of cancer and the resurgence of the hard-shell taco. The small
25123	Paige	The small being my ex-wife, Jordan, wind energy, and, ah he-he-hell, fruit-infused liquors, your name still would not have come up.
25124	Dr. Cox	I'm honestly not sure which one of you I find more irritating.
25125	J.D.	What does he find irritating about you?
25126	Dr. Cox	Fire at will.
25127	Paige	I embrace the Lord, Jesus Christ as my personal savior.
25128	J.D.'s Thoughts	I'm not sure why it was suddenly so awkward, but I wish something would break the tension.
25129	Turk	Hallelujah! A brother's 'bout to have some sex. Ha-Ha-Hallelujah! A brother's 'bout to have some seeeeeex! Smack the money maker! Smack it!
25130	J.D.	That's how he likes it.
25131	Turk	Awww, sex time, people!
25132	J.D.	He's married, so it's strictly procreation sex! His wife's throwing her legs up in the air because they're trying for a boy....Like Jesus.
25133	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
25134	Paige	You know what used to drive Perry nuts as a kid? Every night we'd play Horse in the driveway, and I'd always kick his ass.
25135	J.D.	Can Christians say "ass" now? I have a friend, Pat Casey, he called his mom an ass once. She hit him in the face with an iron. He still goes to church, but he can't whistle anymore.
25136	Paige	OK. I'm gonna go say hi to Jordan.
25137	J.D.	She's dynamite. How'd you end up with a born-again Christian sister?
25138	Dr. Cox	I don't know. Maybe the TV was broken one day and she picked up the bible instead and found it to be just a darn good read. Or maybe it had something to do with our mother's ability to watch silently as our dad drunkenly knocked us from room to room. What do you think there, Newbie?
25139	J.D.	Probably the room to room thing.
25140	Dr. Cox	Uh-huh.
25141	J.D.'s Narration	It's always hard to find the right words in a moment like this.
25142	J.D.	Dr. Cox, if it makes you feel any better, at the baptism I'll be there to keep Paige company.
25143	Dr. Cox	Yeah. You're not going.
25144	J.D.	Dammit! Stupid baptism.
25145	Turk	I'm gonna have some sex! I'm gonna have some se-AAAHHHH!
25146	Carla	OK, my cervical mucus is peaking, my temperature is slightly elevated, and these pillows will keep my vagina angled so the semen can pool against my cervix.
25147	Turk	Baby, that is some god-awful dirty talk.
25148	Carla	Turk, we're making a baby, now let's get down to business.
25149	Turk	Honey, I need to feel the heat. I need at least 30 minutes of foreplay. Then, and only then can I be fully ready to make love to you.
25150	Carla	Tyra Banks.
25151	Turk	Yeh...
25152	Carla	There, you're ready.
25153	Janitor	Oh, hey fellas, I'm trying to give someone the evil eye over there. Would you mind breaking it up so I can...you understand.Thanks, fellas, very nice of you. Appreciate it. Thank you.
25154	J.D.	He's just mad because I won't help him move.
25155	Jordan	Well you should have done it. Helping someone move is like oral sex. You do it once and they owe you for life.
25156	Elliot	My high school boyfriend is an accountant and he still does my taxes for free. You what's weird, he also does my brother Barry's.
25157	Dr. Kelso	My son, Harrison, dabbles in sadomasochism and he has a new gimp named Barry. Or is it Larry? At my age it's getting harder and harder to keep track of his gimps.
25158	J.D.'s Narration	And then it occurred to me. This was the perfect opportunity to take an enemy and turn him into a friend.
25159	J.D.	I'll do it.
25160	Janitor	I knew you would. You're very predictable.
25161	J.D. & Janitor	No I'm not. Stop doing that. Peanut butter egg dirt!
25162	Dr. Cox	Newbie, let's go, Mr. Donnelly's test results are in.
25163	J.D.'s Narration	It's never easy to tell a family that medicine isn't working.
25164	Dr. Cox	I uh, I wish I had better news for you. Unfortunately we're not seeing the improvement we'd hoped for with his medication.
25165	Mrs. Donnelly	What are our options?
25166	Dr. Cox	I'm afraid there are no other options.
25167	Paige	There's always prayer.
25168	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh no.
25169	Paige	You know, with God by your side, anything is possible.
25170	Dr. Cox	Could I see you in Stop-Filling-My-Patient's-Head-With-False-Hope ward?Paige, we have protocol here. First, we shake our magic eight ball, then we explore all witchcraft-related options.
25171	Paige	Oh, right, because people who believe in God are crazy. And you're the sane one.
25172	J.D.	Hey, do you guys like improv? Because I'm kind of an expert. There's a game we play in class where you make up what people are saying. Like, watch: Do you want some pie? Not me, I hate pie. What are you talking about? Who hates pie? Everyone loves pie. I've always hated pie! You never understood me. You're a pie racist! Well, you're a cobbler whore!
25173	J.D.'s Thoughts	For God's sake, get off pie!
25174	Paige	Jerk.
25175	Dr. Cox	Republican.
25176	J.D.	Pie.I've got to find an improv class that doesn't meet in the back of a pie shop.
25177	Turk	Ugh. Dammit, I've gotta go have ovulation sex again.
25178	J.D.	Ar you actually complaining about getting to have sex? Because that is so insensitive, Turk.
25179	Turk	J.D...
25180	J.D.	Let me feel my feelings, Turk! We worked on this!
25181	Turk	I really gotta stop doing that.
25182	Elliot	You can talk to me if you want.
25183	Turk	Elliot, I can't talk to you about sex, I can't understand any of that crazy gibberish you use. Penis is, shwing-something.
25184	Elliot	Swhing-shwong, peepers or peep.
25185	Turk	Right, and vagina is...?
25186	Elliot	Disgusting, but also bajingo or hoo-hoo.
25187	Turk	Here's the deal. I'm trying to get in the mood, right? And Carla's going on and on about her cervical mucus.
25188	Elliot	Uh-bup-bup. Mmm-mm. From now on cervical mucus will be referred to as icky-sticky.
25189	Turk	Icky-sticky.
25190	Elliot	Continue.
25191	J.D.	Morning, sunshine!
25192	Dr. Cox	Never. Say that. Again.
25193	J.D.	Noted. That was quite a fight you had with your sister yesterday. Won't it be a little awkward when you show up at St. Mary's cathedral on the corner of Maple and Pine, right across from Temple Oheb Shalom at 4 PM today?
25194	Dr. Cox	That's not where the baptism is, but nice try.
25195	J.D.	Mark my words, when that little bastard is dipped in water, I will be there.
25196	Dr. Cox	Anyway, I just invited Paige to come by, Mr. Donnelly's labs came back. It looks like the steroid is finally working. If you happen to be keeping score at home, that would be Medicine: 1, God: 0.
25197	J.D.	You don't have to rub it in her face.
25198	Dr. Cox	Yeah, and I don't have to stick Dr. Kelso's stethoscope down my pants every morning, but I still do. Now isn't there some other relationship out there you could be trying to fix?
25199	J.D.'s Narration	Actually, there was.
25200	J.D.	Morning, sunshine.
25201	Janitor	I don't like that.
25202	J.D.	Nobody seems to.
25203	Janitor	Well, come on. Let's grab some boxes and get to moving, huh?
25204	J.D.'s Thoughts	I hope I can find a way to connect with him.
25205	Janitor	Thanks for saving that. That's one of my favorite pieces.
25206	J.D.	You're welcome, friend.I gotta say, you've got a lot of Asian art around here.
25207	Janitor	When I was kid, I always thought I'd travel the world, you know? So after college, I went to China. Did all the normal touristy things, I saw the Great Wall, ate the food, had a baby with a local. You know, just the regular stuff. Anyway, I guess I decorate my place this way because it reminds me of a more optimistic time. That probably sounds crazy.
25208	J.D.	Doesn't sound crazy at all.
25209	Janitor	Thanks, buddy.
25210	J.D.'s Thoughts	And like that, I was in.
25211	Turk	Damn!
25212	Carla	I paged you an hour ago.
25213	Turk	I was in surgery.
25214	Carla	Is that doughnut glaze on your cheek?
25215	Turk	Guess we're not having sex, huh?
25216	Carla	Ohh, no we're having sex. Get in there.
25217	Turk	Wait, baby, I'm too full.
25218	Carla	Now, Turk!
25219	Turk	Man!
25220	J.D.	Long story short, after confirming it with my bunk mates, that counselor and his "friendship lotion" were transferred out of our cabin and we never spoke about it again.
25221	Janitor	Well, what doesn't kill you...
25222	J.D.'s Thoughts	We're as thick as two thieves in a pod.
25223	Janitor	OK. Time to move some of the heavier stuff. So you might want to put on these gloves. And the attic upstairs has a lot of fiberglass in it. So here's a hat.
25224	J.D.	Thanks, pal.
25225	Janitor	Sure, bud.
25226	J.D.'s Narration	I figured out why I'm so great at managing relationships. I don't rub things in people's faces.
25227	Dr. Cox	I thought you might like to know that your husband's chest X-ray look better. He is finally starting to improve.
25228	Mrs. Donnelly	Thank you so much.
25229	Dr. Cox	I was really just doing my job.
25230	Mrs. Donnelly	Oh, I'm talking to Paige. She was up all night praying with us.
25231	Carla	You big jerk!
25232	J.D.'s Narration	I never go to bed very, very mad.
25233	Turk	Angry sex is awesome.
25234	J.D.'s Narration	And I've always known that if I make the slightest gesture of friendship to a difficult coworker...
25235	Asian man	Who are you?
25236	J.D.'s Narration	...I'll end up robbing an Asian couple's house.
25237	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
25238	J.D.'s Narration	I couldn't help wondering what the sentence was for stealing a Buddha. After all, people get pretty sensitive about religion.
25239	Dr. Cox	Could I comment on the baptism dress?
25240	Paige	I think you should wait until you see the matching slippers and tiny handbag.
25241	Dr. Cox	You're actually asking him to cross-dress on the same day that you're introducing him to a religion that will condemn him to hell for it. That's a trauma two-fer.
25242	Jordan	Can you two please just try to get along? Now I'm getting some blush for Jack because this lace collar is washing out his face. Terrible.
25243	Dr. Cox	Paige, will you just acknowledge that medicine made Mr. Donnelly better?
25244	Paige	Fine. It was medicine.
25245	Dr. Cox	Uh-huh.
25246	Paige	Thank God for creating medicine.
25247	Dr. Cox	Eh- J- Gh -Gh- That's it! That is it!Now, you you may be a total goner. But God's not getting His hands on this one. No way, no how. Come on, Jack. We got places to go.
25248	Carla	Turk, I'm ready!
25249	Turk	All right. So angry sex is awesome. But that's no reason to go down a bad road.Baby, you know what I miss? When your body was kickin'.I ain't touching no damn diapers. WAAAAHHH!Baby, all I'm saying is that in some European countries it's perfectly acceptable for a man to have a mistress.
25250	Carla	Why youI'm gonna make you pay for every word you said!
25251	Turk	Worth it!
25252	J.D.'s Narration	Now that I'm on the lam, I thought about two things. One, what my prison name would be...
25253	J.D.	Gizmo.
25254	J.D.'s Narration	And two, whether some relationships were beyond repair. Then fate threw me another curve.
25255	J.D.	Hey, who's your friend?
25256	Dr. Cox	My boy in a dress. Who's yours?
25257	J.D.	Well, seeing as he gave me the strength to outrun the Sheriff's K-9 unit, I'd say he's my new god.You can rub mine's belly if I can rub yours.
25258	Dr. Cox	Don't you touch my son.
25259	Turk	Angry sex is like a drug. I can't stop.
25260	Carla	I'll be right out, I'm just fixing my hair.
25261	Turk	Rake's in the closet, baby.Help me!
25262	Elliot	Turk, just go back to the way things were. Carla loved it. Don't you get it? Trying to make a baby with you is the sexiest thing in he world to her.
25263	Turk	Elliot, I'm a man. I've been programmed to think that a baby is the worst possible consequence of sex.
25264	Elliot	Well, it's not.Honey for my honey!
25265	Boy	Why are you stopping?
25266	Elliot	Losing a baseball scholarship because a bear ate your arm is a much worse consequence of sex.
25267	Turk	You have to help me end this angry sex cycle.
25268	Carla	I'm ready.
25269	Elliot	Oh, Carla, Turk's making you mad on purpose because the angry sex is so good. Ahhh, the cycle is broken.
25270	Dr. Cox	There will be no whining or crying while we sit here, understood?
25271	J.D.	He seems fine.
25272	Dr. Cox	I wasn't talking to him.
25273	J.D.	I don't whine or cry.
25274	Janitor	Really. How do you explain these photos of you whining and crying as you run away from the Kwan's apartment?
25275	J.D.	These are coasters.
25276	Janitor	My camera's broken.
25277	J.D.	You turned me into a felon!
25278	Dr. Cox	You know what, there, Newbie? You can go to the baptism. Take Jack. Jordan will kill me if he's not there. Plus, I know you. You're exactly one watered-down appletini away from trying to fix my sister and me.
25279	J.D.	No, thank you. If there's one thing I learned from this guy, it's that I need to stop trying to fix people's relationships.
25280	Janitor	You're welcome.
25281	J.D.	Still. I've never know you to judge a person based on their beliefs. In fact, you're pretty tolerant of everyone. Except Hugh Jackman.
25282	Dr. Cox	Eh.
25283	J.D.	I just don't understand why your sister being religious bothers you so much.
25284	Dr. Cox	It doesn't.
25285	J.D.	Then why are you so angry?
25286	J.D	So, do you like pie? Look at me. Do I look like a guy who doesn't like pie? I love pie. Incidentally, where do you by your loincloths?
25287	Jordan	I-I don't think I can do this without Perry. I mean, he's my everything.
25288	Paige	You're right. It would be weird if you were like that.
25289	Jordan	Right?
25290	Paige	Yeah.
25291	Jordan	Yeah.
25292	Turk	I just don't understand why we can't have fun.
25293	Carla	I am so glad you had to hurt my feelings to have fun.
25294	Turk	I can't believe you! Calm down!
25295	Carla	Calm down? I am going to kill you.
25296	Turk	You hear that? She's gonna kill me. Get her.
25297	Elliot	OK, look. You two stop fighting or I will turn this church around.
25298	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes I think it takes a child to make you see the light.
25299	Elliot	Isn't he beautiful?
25300	Turk	Yeah. He is.
25301	Paige	Oh, wow! Has anyone ever told you you're an extremely average athlete?
25302	Dr. Cox	Oh, that's cold, sis. That's ice cold. You know, uh, I've been thinking about why I hate seeing you so much.
25303	Paige	Please, Perry, don't hold back.
25304	Dr. Cox	It's not the God stuff. I've worked hard to try to forget everything about our childhood. But when I see you, I-I can't think about anything else.
25305	Paige	It's hard for me, too.
25306	Dr. Cox	But I don't see why you can't be there for the major events in Jack's life.
25307	Paige	I'd love to see him turn three.
25308	Dr. Cox	The major events, Paige? His graduation, his wedding, his divorce, his funeral. The big four?
25309	Paige	I beat you at Horse, he has a church wedding.
25310	Dr. Cox	Done.
25311	Paige	That went in, didn't it?
25312	Dr. Cox	Did you thank the G-man for that?
25313	Paige	That was all me, baby.
25314	Dr. Cox	Yeah, it was.
25315	J.D.'s Narration	So maybe relationships can be fixed. Whether it's by coming around to your spouse's way of thinking.
25316	Turk	Carla, I'm sorry. I didn't get how this baby-making stuff could be sexy. But I do now.
25317	Carla	Well, you know, Turk? I can't get angry if you give me a little help.
25318	Turk	]in Carla's ear] If you had no hair, you'd look like Danny DeVito.
25319	Carla	Aww, Turk, a little help.
25320	J.D.'s Narration	Or by reassuring the Kwan's that their big guy didn't desert them.In the end, you just have to be willing to take the first step.
25321	Dr. Cox	By the way, Jack's birthday is in the spring...sometime.
25322	Paige	March 21st. Bye, Perry.
25323	Dr. Cox	Bye, Paige. You know, Paige is a silly name.
25324	Paige	Perry's worse.
25325	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
25326	J.D.'s Narration	Since my scooter was in the shop, I didn't know how I was going to get to work today. But luckily, my neighbor, Ronald, lent me his ride.Ronald's six. But I still got there in time to steal the security guard's Arts and Leisure section.
25327	J.D.	Hello!
25328	J.D.'s Narration	Around here, everyone has some sort of morning ritual. Whether it's getting help on the daily word jumble from the dyslexic tracheotomy patient...
25329	Elliot	Uh, T-E-I-P-O-P.
25330	Patient	Potpie.
25331	Elliot	Save your voice, Marcia. Mm. Save it.
25332	J.D.'s Narration	...Cursing out an innocent orderly over a stolen physical therapy tub....
25333	Dr. Kelso	Dammit, you'd better find it! Physical therapy tubs don't just disappear!
25334	J.D.'s Narration	...Or for some, just a relaxing afternoon soak on the roof.
25335	Todd	Oh come on, let me in. This totally covers my boys.
25336	Janitor	You try to get in here wearing that thing and I'm gonna give you a four-story atomic wedgie.
25337	J.D.	Wah! My eyes!Well, yeah, it hurts. But when you accept the keys to the hog, you become a lifetime member of the danger club. Excuse me, fine ladies. I've got lives to save.
25338	Elliot	Ronald's gonna be mad.
25339	J.D.	Yeah, well he's six. What's he gonna do, kick my ass?
25340	J.D.'s Thoughts	Again.
25341	Elliot	Hey, check this guy's chart out. He says he's been in pain for, like, three months.
25342	J.D.'s Narration	For doctors, pain is complicated. Every patient handles it differently, depending on their race...
25343	Asian Patient	Does what hurt?
25344	J.D.'s Narration	...gender...
25345	Husband	Ow! I just bit the inside of my lip! Agh! Nothing's ever hurt so badly!
25346	J.D.'s Narration	...or even their sex life.
25347	S&M Guy	OHHHHHH....yeah, that feels good.
25348	J.D.'s Narration	And since there's no way to truly gauge how much pain someone's in, we have to rely on an archaic chart.
25349	Elliot	Mr. Peele, you're about a seven on the pain chart.Yep, you're a seven.
25350	Mr. Peele	What's a ten?
25351	J.D.	That's a ten.
25352	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
25353	J.D.'s Narration	After four years here, I'm finally comfortable with helping myself to the nurses' muffin basket.
25354	J.D.'s Thoughts	Mmm...Blueberry-cran-carrot-zucchini-poppy-seed-chocolate chip!
25355	J.D.	All right, everybody, last one here has to do a double shift this weekend.Keith! Looks like you just lost your weekend.
25356	Keith	What? I totally beat Lisa.
25357	J.D.	Lisa, call that androgynous husband of yours and tell him or her you're mine this weekend.
25358	Lisa	But I feel like I edged out James.
25359	J.D.	OK, my bad, so we're not crystal clear on the ground rules. OK, tomorrow it will be the last one to touch my face. Nah, I'm not gonna like that. The last one to touch my bot No, that's probably illegal. I tell you what, I'll just email everyone. That's what I'll do. This day and age that's what you do. OK, over here. Guys, Mr. Jenkins spent all night without being treated. Now, I know he's homeless and smell's like an obese man's twosie.
25360	Mr. Jenkins	Hey!
25361	J.D.	Sorry, thought you were dozing. The thing is, guys, it doesn't matter if he's a homeless guy or some senile old racist.
25362	Mr. Bursick	Which people do I hate again?
25363	J.D.	Immigrants, Mr. Bursick. You hate all immigrants.
25364	Mr. Bursick	And why do I hate
25365	J.D.	I don't have time, Mr. Bursick. Guys, if I give you a patient, I expect you to work your butts off for him. And P.S., Mr. Jenkins is a Vietnam vet. So let's take care of him like he took care of our nation. Get out of here!That's how you light a fire under their butts, Perry, you get 'em going with some inspiration!
25366	Dr. Cox	Too much talking, too much talking, too much talking, too much talking, too much talking, too much talking. Why did you order a BMP test on my patient, Mrs. Wilk, last night?
25367	J.D.	Because she's my patient.
25368	Dr. Cox	Interesting, seeing as *I* admitted her
25369	J.D.	and *I* treated her last night.
25370	Mr. Bursick	Dr. Dorian, why do I hate all
25371	J.D.	Because they're stealing all of our jobs, Mr. Bursick, stealing all of our jobs. Perry, we've spent an equal amount of time on Mrs. Wilk, and seeing as we're both attendings, i.e. equals, why don't we let her decide who her doctor is, huh?
25372	Dr. Cox	Or, we could skip the day trip to Unnecessary-land and instead, simply concede that Mrs. Wilk is *my* patient and while we are both attendings, we are in no way equals. We are, in fact, not equals. We are...mmmm...un-equals.
25373	Mrs. Wilk	I choose Dr. Dorian.
25374	J.D.	Oh my God. Oh, my God, I don't even believe it! I don't believe it! I don't believe it-lieve it-lieve it! Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo! Yes! I'm shaking, look at this. It's crazy talk.
25375	Mrs. Wilk	He played hearts with me all night.You're a very strange young man, aren't you?
25376	J.D.	I was a premie.
25377	Elliot	Mr. Peele, I have run everytest and I cannot find any medical reason for your pain.
25378	Mr. Peele	GUUHH!
25379	J.D.'s Narration	Then Elliot did what every good doctor does when they're truly stumped. She pawned him off.
25380	Elliot	I've called a surgical consult.
25381	Mr. Peele	Nnnnye.
25382	Turk	Help has arrived! Help has arrived.
25383	Elliot	Ha. Turkleton!
25384	J.D.'s Narration	And then Turk said what every surgeon says when they're not sure what to do.
25385	Turk	Hm. Mind if I slice you open?
25386	Mr. Peele	DAAAAAHH!
25387	Turk	AAAAAHHH! Uncool!
25388	Carla	OK, listen up everyone! I'm sure you all got the flyer I made reminding everyone of the annual staff picture. I need to know by a show of hands how many of you aren't gonna be able to make it.Oh, come on! Aren't you guys embarrassed by our last three staff pictures?Laverne. I'm gonna need a little bit of your church enthusiasm to help sell this.Dammit, everyone, we are a family.
25389	Laverne	A family, people!
25390	Carla	And I know we love each other.
25391	Laverne	Love is all we got!
25392	Carla	So can't we just take ten minutes from our day to take a real staff photo?
25393	Laverne	Yes, we can! Yes, we can!
25394	Carla	Tambourine's a little much, Laverne.
25395	Elliot	Carla, I don't photograph well. On my driver's license I look like Gary Busey.
25396	Gary Busey	They say the same thing about me. Ha.
25397	Turk	See you later, Elliot.
25398	Dr. Cox	I am gonna let big Bob here give the first excuse.
25399	Dr. Kelso	Blah, blah, blah, I'm not doing it.
25400	Dr. Cox	I'm caught on his collar!
25401	Carla	This picture is happening!
25402	Janitor	No it's not.
25403	Carla	Oh, what do you know, mop jock?
25404	Janitor	I've predicted a couple of things over the years. The kitchen fire of '97, the kitchen fire of '98, the arson conviction of Luis the fry cook, and of course, the eventual termination of the hospital's Convicts to Cooks program. Bottom line? Not gonna happen.
25405	Turk	Not gonna happen! No, not gonna happen, ha, ha! Not gonna hapBy the way, uh, I won't be at the picture either.
25406	Carla	You'll be there. You'll all be there.
25407	J.D.	Hellooo! If you're wondering what a thank-you-for-being-my-doctor card from Mrs. Wilk looks like, it looks a little something like this.
25408	Dr. Cox	"Happy Anniversary, gals?"
25409	J.D.	Oops. This one's actually from my Aunt Judy and her lady friends. Must have grabbed the wrong card.
25410	Dr. Cox	Uhh, Newbie...
25411	J.D.	Oh, right, your imaginary warning light. Don't be mad, Perry, this day was bound to come. See, I've studied you. I've taken your best qualities and my best qualities and I've combined them into something even better. Much the way that iced tea and lemonade were joined to become an Arnold Palmer. Incidentally, has anyone ever done less to become famous? I mean, yea for me, I mixed two drinks together.
25412	Dr. Cox	Arnold Palmer is a golfer.
25413	J.D.	I'm sure he has lots of hobbies, Perry. The man's a drink mogul.
25414	J.D.'s Narration	In a hospital, even the best of moods can be ruined by somebody handing you a chart.
25415	J.D.	Do you have any family, Mrs. Wilk?
25416	Mrs. Wilk	No. I was married twice. Divorced one, the other one died. Wrong one died.
25417	J.D.	Look, Mrs. Wilk, you have something called systemic amyloidosis. Now, it's in your liver now, but eventually it will shut down all your organs. There's a treatment, but it's very invasive, and at best, it'll just give you a little more time.
25418	Mrs. Wilk	Well, I've had a great life son.
25419	J.D.	Say no more. I'm gonna take amazing care of you.
25420	Mrs. Wilk	OK.
25421	Turk	How's it going today, buddy?
25422	J.D.	Pretty crappy. I just had to tell an old lady she's dying. How about you?
25423	Turk	OK. Elliot turfed this chronic pain patient to me. I have no idea what's wrong with him, so I have to do exploratory surgery.
25424	J.D.'s Thoughts	I always wondered what exploratory surgery was like.
25425	Turk	I've made the first incision. I'm going in.Nurse! Hat!Colon. Why did it have to be the colon?Removing the golden tumor.Ladies...They knew the risks.
25426	J.D.	Watch out for colon darts.
25427	Turk	Where's the doughnut truck? I got paged there was a doughnut truck out here!
25428	Elliot	I got paged there was a handbag sample sale!
25429	Todd	Where's the boobie-touching booth?
25430	J.D.	It's weird, it's like everyone was lured out here by the thing they want most in the world.
25431	Dr. Cox	Hey! You're not getting your ass kicked!
25432	Dr. Kelso	Hold the phone! Look! Bleachers! Ladder! Bucket of combs! She's trying to take the picture! Scatter!
25433	Carla	Nobody move! Laverne, door!
25434	Laverne	Nobody's gettin' past here, baby!
25435	Carla	OK, everybody, one, two...
25436	Janitor	...and, three.
25437	J.D.	What are you doing here?
25438	Dr. Cox	Mrs. Wilk was asking me some questions that I actually thought would be best answered by you.
25439	Mrs. Wilk	Why did that sweaty attorney ask me if my affairs were in order?
25440	J.D.	Because I want to make sure you're as comfortable as possible.'
25441	Mrs. Wilk	As comfortable as possible? For what?
25442	Dr. Cox	I'm going to sit for this.
25443	J.D.	For the place that you're going. You know, the big, puffy, clouds? The bright lights? All your old friends?
25444	Mrs. Wilk	Seattle?
25445	J.D.	No, no, no, not not Seattle. The you know, the dying peacefully place.
25446	Mrs. Wilk	What are you talking about?
25447	Dr. Cox	Now, I'm going to stand.
25448	J.D.	This morning you told me you'd had a great life.
25449	Mrs. Wilk	Exactly, and I'd like to continue it.
25450	J.D.	Oh, this is just a misunderstanding, I'm so sorry. Tell it was a misunderstanding, that...
25451	Dr. Cox	He's tried to kill before.
25452	J.D's Narration	In a hospital, the words "I'm sorry" can mean a lot of different things.
25453	Turk	So, the surgery went fine. Unfortunately, I didn't find any medical reason for you pain.
25454	J.D's Narration	It can mean "I'm giving up on you."
25455	Turk	I'm sorry.
25456	J.D.'s Narration	It can mean you're not sorry at all.
25457	Janitor	Sorry your picture didn't turn out.
25458	Carla	Yeah.
25459	J.D.'s Narration	And sometimes "I'm sorry" can mean your services are no longer needed.
25460	Mrs. Wilk	I'm sorry, Dr. Dorian.
25461	Dr. Cox	So, you gave her the old death sentence, did you? In the business, we call that a rookie mistake. Thanks for playing.
25462	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
25463	Dr. Kelso	Who the hell is responsible for this?
25464	J.D.'s Narration	Unfortunately, not even my mouthful of apple-pear-orange-banana-cherry-berry could lift my depression about losing my patient to Dr. Cox.
25465	Dr. Cox	Hand over your stethoscope.
25466	J.D.	What?
25467	Dr. Cox	In victory, I get your stethoscope. It's a trophy. You're lucky we're not back in olden times. I'd have made a necklace out of your teeth.
25468	J.D.	I find this highly unprofessional.
25469	Dr. Cox	Now I'm going to check on Mr. Jenkins, your war hero. I feel he, too, deserves a competent doctor. In fact, I'm gonna take all of your patients, and consequently, your only reason for getting out of that lacy, over-pillowed, four poster virgin cocoon you call a bed every morning.
25470	J.D.	I gotta get Mrs. Wilk back.When did we have a shade remote? I didn't know we had shade remotes.
25471	Janitor	Aww, either your picture didn't come out, or we got a hospital full of vampire doctors.
25472	J.D.'s Thoughts	Vampire doctors? How did he hear about my screenplay?
25473	Carla	I don't know why you did it, but I know it was you.
25474	Janitor	How?
25475	Carla	Because it's always you.
25476	Janitor	It's not always me.
25477	Dr. Kelso	GAAAAH-AAAH-AAAH!!!Who the hell put tiny wheels on my shoes?!
25478	Janitor	Well, that's his fault. He took a nap in the lounge.
25479	Carla	Why would you ruin this for me? I mean, I didn't even ask you to be there.
25480	Janitor	Imagine that. I've been working here for thirteen years and I guess I don't rate as part of the family.
25481	Carla	Did you want to be in the picture?
25482	Janitor	No! It's just uh...wh...uh..it's ah...I gotta go.
25483	Dr. Kelso	I actually love these.
25484	J.D.	Ms. Brooks, your blood work looks fine. But I'd like to take one more sample. Just for me.You know, you taste a little anemic. Get that down to the lab, buddy.
25485	Keith	Right away, Dr. Acula.
25486	J.D.	That's what they call me. How you doing?The end.
25487	Turk	So Dr. Acula is a doctor *and* a vampire?
25488	J.D.	He's both. And at the very end, I'm gonna put "Dr. Acula" across the screen, take that period, get it out of there. Squish it together, it'll say "Dracula"
25489	Turk	That is an awesome ending!
25490	J.D.	Um, thank you for telling me what I already know, Turk.
25491	Elliot	Frick, it's Mrs. Peele! And one of us has to talk to her.
25492	Turk	All right, the first one to chug their slushy is off the hook. Come on, here we go!GAAAAAHHHHH!! AAAAAAAHHHH!! OHH! Brainfreeze!
25493	Mrs. Peele	Why is my husband being discharged?
25494	Elliot	Look, Mrs. Peele, we really cannot jus
25495	Turk	YAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH! AAAAHHAHHAHHH!! It's so cold!
25496	Elliot	Mrs. Peele, even though Dr. Turk is currently incapacitated by his cherry-flavored beverage, he is a fantastic surgeon.
25497	Turk	Yuh-huh.
25498	Elliot	And he didn't find anything. And I am a great doctor...
25499	Turk	Ehh...
25500	Elliot	...and I didn't either. Don't you think that maybe the pain could all be in his head?
25501	Mrs. Peele	Last week, we were all watching TV and he was in too much pain to get up and use the bathroom. So he soiled himself. On the couch, right in front of our son. How do you explain that?
25502	Turk	Maybe there was a really good game on television.
25503	Elliot	Probably not.
25504	J.D.	AHH! My screenplay!
25505	Dr. Kelso	Hey, sport!
25506	J.D.	You just lit your pipe on my title page.
25507	Dr. Kelso	I heard Mrs. Wilk gave you the axe.
25508	J.D.	She said "I've lead a great life." And every doctor in the world knows that's code for "I'm ready to die."
25509	Dr. Kelso	How old do you think I am, Dorian?
25510	J.D.'s Thoughts	OK, there's no way to answer that and not get in trouble. Change the subject.
25511	J.D.	Sir, I would be honored if you and Enid would join me at my place on Sunday for some homemade jambalaya.
25512	Dr. Kelso	Well, it would be good for Enid to get out of the house.
25513	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh my God, he's actually thinking about it. Change the subject back!
25514	J.D.	You're seventy-eight, sir.
25515	Dr. Kelso	You think I'm that old?
25516	J.D.	Jambalaya.
25517	Dr. Kelso	I'm fifty-seven, numb nuts.
25518	J.D.	Really.
25519	Dr. Kelso	I know they say fifty-seven is the new forty.
25520	J.D.	Who?
25521	Dr. Kelso	But lately it seems all people see when they look in my direction is some old guy. Hell, just last week I was in the mall hanging out in Brookstone's and some kid asked me if I was lost.
25522	J.D.	Brookstone? Were you looking for gadgets, sir?
25523	Dr. Kelso	If that's what you trolling for mall ass, then yeah.
25524	J.D.	Oh.
25525	Dr. Kelso	The point is, you think Mrs. Wilk is old enough to die. I'm betting she doesn't agree.
25526	Carla	How am I supposed to know the Janitor has feelings?
25527	Elliot	I should have just believed Mr. Peele. I mean it's not like somebody poos their pants for no reason.
25528	J.D.	Turk did that in college on a bet.
25529	Turk	Carla did not know that story. Thank you.
25530	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes when you're feeling guilty, it's like a storm cloud over your head.
25531	J.D.	I knew there was only one way to make the guilt storm go away.Mrs. Wilk, I'm sorry.Mrs. Wilk, I just wanted to say I was wrong to think that you wouldn't want to try every possible treatment there is, to avoid, you know, the place. You know, there's clouds and...Space Needle...Seattle.
25532	Mrs. Wilk	Yes, you were. Thank you.
25533	J.D.	You're welcome. You got a lot of pluck for an older gal.
25534	Mrs. Wilk	How old do you think I am?
25535	J.D.	Jambalaya!
25536	J.D.'s Narration	There are a lot of ways to make amends.It can be as simple as including someone...
25537	Carla	Hey. I want you to be in the picture.I thought you were trying to kill me.
25538	Janitor	I fought the urge.
25539	Carla	OK.
25540	Janitor	Thanks.
25541	J.D.'s Narration	...Or as complicated as committing to a difficult journey.
25542	Turk	Mr. Peele, we believe your pain is real.
25543	Elliot	And you're not going anywhere until we figure it out.
25544	Mrs. Peele	Thank you.
25545	J.D.'s Narration	The important thing is to regain the respect of your peers.
25546	Dr. Cox	Say, Newbie. I uh, I gotta hand it to you. It took the heart of a lion to apologize to Mrs. Wilk like that.
25547	J.D.	Thank you.
25548	Dr. Cox	Of course it took the incompetence of a bewildered jackass to make that error to begin with. Never make assumptions based on your own perceptions. Just never do it.
25549	J.D.	Really? You've been spending a lot of time treating my guy, Mr. Jenkins, right?
25550	Dr. Cox	Yeah, he's a Vietnam veteran. He deserves as much.
25551	J.D.	Yeah, actually he's just a homeless guy. I made up the war veteran story to motivate my boys. But, what are you gonna do?Oh, come on, you've gotten me like a hundred times. I finally got you once. It was bound to happen, right?
25552	Dr. Cox	I see your point. Kindly blow it out your ass.
25553	Carla	How did you get all these people to come out here?
25554	Janitor	Fear.
25555	Carla	OK, everybody, one, two, three!
25556	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
25557	J.D.'s Narration	Living with Elliot was certainly different. Every inch of her apartment was filled with girly stuff. There were lavender-scented candles, pink robes, bath salts. It. Was. Awesome.My first day off in weeks. Only one thing could make it better: Cranking up the Toto.
25558	J.D.	Mango body butter?
25559	J.D.'s Narration	Even though it sucks being paged to the hospital by an intern, there's nothing I like more than riding my scooter, Sasha, through puddles after a rain.
25560	J.D.'s Thoughts	Here comes a big 'un!
25561	J.D.	Where was I?You're not aware of any sort of odd, underground canal system beneath the hospital, are you? I think I saw a manatee.
25562	Janitor	Was his name Julian?
25563	J.D.	We didn't exchange pleasantries.
25564	Janitor	That's Julian. Watch it, wet paint. Kelso's starting a new line system to help people get around. Green's gonna go to the smoker's lounge, blue to the ICU, and yellow to all the exits.
25565	J.D.	What's red for?
25566	Janitor	Sneaker painting.
25567	J.D.	OK, I'm here. What's the emergency Keith?
25568	Keith	Uh, do you want Mr. Fleming on unfractionated or low molecular weight Heparin?
25569	J.D.	They're the exact same thing. Every doctor here knows that. Why would you page me?
25570	Dr. Cox	Because I told him to, and I know what you're thinking, Dorothy. Why would I have one of your interns call you in on one of your precious days off for something so gosh-darn trivial? Well, the real question ought to be: Why, when you were an intern, did you call me in time after time after time after time? So now, to commemorate the first of many unnecessary disruptions of your life, I've invited Laverne's church choir here to summarize my feelings in exuberant song.
25571	Choir	Payback is a bitch!
25572	Laverne	Mmhmm!
25573	Choir	Payback is a bitch!
25574	Laverne	Oh yeah!
25575	Choir	Payback is a bitch!
25576	Laverne	Mmhmm!
25577	Choir	Payback is a bitch! Ohhh, Ooohh!
25578	Laverne	It's just the beginning!
25579	Choir	Ooohh!
25580	Laverne	But it's payback! Ohh, It's payback! Ohhh,
25581	Choir	Payback is a bitch!
25582	Laverne	Payback!
25583	Choir	Payback is a bitch!
25584	Laverne	Payback!
25585	Choir	Payback is a bitch!
25586	Laverne	Oh, Lord!
25587	Choir	Payback is a bitch!
25588	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
25589	J.D.'s Thoughts	I gotta get back home before anyone asks me to do stuff. Fat guy! Go! Go! Go! Move out! Move out!Thank you, fast food industry.
25590	Dr. Kelso	Dorian, I need you to do the residents' call schedule for next month.
25591	J.D.	Sir, I'm not even supposed to be here.
25592	Dr. Kelso	Ahh, me neither, son. I was one of the most promising shortstops to come out of Altoona, Pennsylvania. Then came the Dominicans. Long story short, calling them all "Pepe" was just racist enough to get me a lifelong ban from the Appalachian Rookie League. Have the schedules on my desk by lunch.
25593	Carla	That's gonna be us someday.
25594	Turk	How does that not make you nervous? I mean what if our kid is out of control? Like, I was watching Webster last night, right? And Webster got all into the pancake mix. And baby, I mean all into the pancake mix.
25595	Carla	Oh, Turk, that's a stupid sitcom.I mean, that's a sitcom.
25596	Turk	What if the second our baby's born I start screwing things up?Oh, my God, hey, little doll! Oh, God, I can't believe it!
25597	Jordan	OK, either the heat in my office is broken, or I drifted off and fantasized about Rudy Giuliani again.
25598	Turk	Ha ha! He's not even sexy! Right, baby?
25599	Carla	Ahh, Rudy, don't stop...
25600	Turk	Baby!
25601	Carla	Huh?
25602	Jordan	Relax! She's only fantasizing because you don't satisfy her. Any-who, can someone take Jack for a minute?
25603	Carla	No problem!
25604	Jordan	Thank you.
25605	Carla	See, Turk? I'm great with kids. And I promise you don't even have to check in as a parent until you have to teach our son about sports.
25606	Turk	And satisfying women. 'Cause I know how to satisfy a woman, right baby?
25607	Carla	I'm sure you can.
25608	Turk	That's what I'm talking about.
25609	J.D.	Done, and I am outta here.Dammit!Keith, you've got to stop paging me for totally unimportant things!Ohhh! That man's chest cavity is completely open. I can see his heart beating.
25610	Keith	He sneezed and all his surgical staples popped out!
25611	J.D.	Good page, good page!
25612	Elliot	OK, rock-tors. That's my name for doctors who rock. Next patient.
25613	J.D.'s Narration	Ever since her fellowship, Elliot loved that her interns saw her as an endocrinology expert.
25614	Intern #1	Doctor Reid, why would Mr. Brown develop new onset diabetes and high blood pressure simultaneously?
25615	Elliot	Well, as an endocrinology expert, eh-heh, in my expert opinion both can be expertly explained by a pituitary adenoma causing Cushing's syndrome.
25616	Dr. Cox	Hate to burst your bubble there, Barbie, but your endocrinology fellowship lasted all of five days. Granted, to you, five days may seem like an eternity seeing as it's roughly five times as long as any of your white, pasty relationships have lasted, but trust me. That hardly makes you an expert.
25617	Elliot	Oh, really? Well you never went to assface school, but you seem to be an expert at that. Am I right?
25618	J.D.	Here's some!
25619	Dr. Cox	You're going to high-five that? Bi-hig mistake.
25620	J.D.	I didn't know what I was high-fiving, I gotta stop doing that.
25621	Elliot	Did you eat my mango body butter?
25622	J.D.	No.
25623	J.D.'s Thoughts	I shmeared it on a bagel.
25624	Turk	Dr. Kelso! 'Sup? Look, I just heard that we're doing our first ever in-house heart transplant. Now, I know, you'll be objective in choosing which surgical resident gets to assist. But, I also thought you might enjoy this commemorative Dr. Kelso bobblehead. Huh?
25625	Dr. Kelso	Oh, bobbleheads. You always think you're going to get bored with it, but you never do.Bobbly, bobbly, bobbly, bobbly, bobbly, bobbly, bobbly, bobbly, bobbly, bobbly...
25626	Turk	Sir?
25627	Dr. Kelso	Eh..oh..Turkleton, you're still here? Did you honestly think you'd be the only surgeon to walk in here trying to bribe me?
25628	Todd	Inflatable five!
25629	Dr. Kelso	None of you will be assisting on anything because we still don't have a donor heart. Last night, Mr. Bolger here was declared brain dead. We have to convince his family to pull the plug and give us his heart. Whichever one of you Beni-Hana rejects pulls this off gets the operation.Go!
25630	Ted	My band has decided we're only singing songs from classic movies now.
25631	J.D.	Ted, I'm a little busy, OK? Toodles.
25632	Intern #2	Dr. Reid, what are the possible cardiac complications to thyrotoxicosis?
25633	Elliot	Ah. Mmm. Hold on, I just have to blow my nose.
25634	J.D.'s Narration	Even though I was happy for Elliot, the endocrinology expert, I still couldn't figure out how she knew so damn much.
25635	Worthless Peons	Just a still town girl on a Saturday night / Looking for the fight of her life...
25636	Elliot	Uh, to answer your question, thyrotoxicosis can manifest with incessant tachycardia leading to cardiomyopathy.
25637	Worthless Peons	...Locking rhythms to the beat of her heart, changing woman into life...
25638	Dr. Cox	Therefore, Mr. Langley's pancreatitis is most likely secondary to gallstones.
25639	Elliot	Wrong-o, Perry. Mr. Langley's pancreatitis is most likely due to to Type 1 familial hyper-lipoproteinemia as demonstrated by the eruptive xanthomas on the Achilles tendon.
25640	Interns	Ooohh!
25641	Dr. Cox	Interns, flee, now!Now there is just no way you could have known that off the top of that straw-colored scarecrow head of yours.
25642	Elliot	Uh, hold on. I need to take a quick mental picture of your total humiliation.Kk-kk. Got it.
25643	Dr. Cox	There are actually many things in life that I've yet to figure out. Like, why men wear cell phones on their belt when they could so easily fit them in their pocket, mere millimeters away. Or why, and I'm not complaining, women wear tube tops, even though every ten seconds it makes them do this."Get back in there!" But, of all my endless queries, the one thing I damn sure will figure out and soon is how you keep coming up with all these fancy-pants answers. It is, for all intents and purposes, like they're falling from the sky.
25644	Carla	Excuse me, can anyone else watch this kid for a second?
25645	Turk	She'll be all right. I wonder what's taking Jordan so long.
25646	Jordan	Oh, my God, it's like a hundred and thirty degrees in here.I have got to get out of here!Mmm. I think the silicone in my lips is expanding. Ohh.
25647	Turk	I mean, I've got to talk to the Bolger family about getting their son's heart but I can't find them anywhere.
25648	Laverne	Oh, they're in the doctor's lounge.
25649	Turk	Oh, my God, Laverne, I love you. Listen if any other surgeon asks about them, you send them someplace else. The cafeteria, the zoo, I don't care. I'm going to get my heart!
25650	Mr. Bolger	We're just not sure, Dr. Turk.
25651	J.D.'s Narration	When a career opportunity is slipping through their fingers, even a doctor can succumb to one of the basest human impulses.
25652	Turk	You know, I've donated an organ.
25653	J.D.'s Narration	They can lie.
25654	Turk	See, my buddy, he was sick, and so I gave him one of my kidneys.
25655	Mr. Bolger	But my son only has one heart.
25656	Turk	But, uh, a short time after that I donated my other kidney.
25657	Mr. Bolger	We're going to check on our son.
25658	J.D.'s Thoughts	OK, the coast is clear. Just a few more steps and you're out of here.
25659	Carla	J.D.! I need to talk to someone. Here. Take him.
25660	Janitor	What?
25661	Carla	Yep.Come on.
25662	Janitor	Hey, wait. No!
25663	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Reid, our hospital lecture series is tonight and our psychologist, Dr. Burke, had to cancel his talk on fear of public speaking.
25664	Elliot	Why, because he's afraid of speaking in public?
25665	Dr. Kelso	No, his depression finally got the best of him and he hung himself.Any-who, we need a substitute speaker and Dr. Cox suggested you'd be the perfect person for an intensive Q-and-A on endocrinology. Be in the classroom at six.
25666	Dr. Cox	And Barbie, say, if it's cold in there you can just borrow my lab coat. It's super warm because I lined it with these. Ta-da!
25667	Carla	J.D., I have to admit this to somebody. I don't like kids!
25668	J.D.	What are you talking about? You're the most maternal person I know.
25669	Carla	I'm a nurse, J.D., I'm trained to fake it. I just don't understand whats so adorable in "Yay, you made a poopie in the potty!" I'm supposed to be impressed? There's a monkey at the zoo who can do that. I mean, you know, when he's not playing with himself.
25670	J.D.	Well, if you don't want a baby, Carla, don't have a baby.
25671	Carla	But J.D., I want to have a child with Turk more than anything in the world. I know, it's crazy, but I'm a girl and that's how we roll. What are we gonna do? I'm supposed to be the brave one.
25672	Turk	Dude, you gotta help me out.
25673	J.D.'s Narration	A hospital can sometimes feel like a magical place, where people's hopes and dreams are often far from ordinary.
25674	J.D.	Whether they're looking for brains, a heart, or courage. As for me, I was just gonna keep on following that yellow line and hope I'd eventually get back home.
25675	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
25676	Laverne	So how was the zoo?
25677	Todd	It was awesome. They had lions and tigers and bears......Oh my. Hey there.
25678	Turk	Dude, it was awful. I couldn't stop lying to them. I only have two moves. If surgery goes well, the fake-modest nod and wink. Now, if surgery goes bad and the guy dies, there's always the head-shake-sad-walkaway.
25679	J.D.	Turk, Toto and I are going home.
25680	Turk	Fine!
25681	J.D.	OK, I'll help.
25682	Turk	Thank you! Now how do I tell those people to let their so go?
25683	J.D.	Just try to imagine what they're going through. I mean sometimes I think about what it's gonna be like when you die.
25684	Turk	Because you think I'm going first because of my diabetes.
25685	J.D.	Right, and where do we meet up in heaven?
25686	Turk	At the milkshake pool on the lesbian cloud.
25687	J.D.	I'll see you there, player! I love religion. The point is, Turk, if someone tried to pull the plug on you without being totally honest with you, you know where they'd end up?
25688	Turk	In hell, watching The View.
25689	J.D.	Next to the super-high, unreachable cupcake table.
25690	J.D.'s Narration	After trying to get out of the hospital vertically, I decided to go the horizontal route: hiding in a body bag.
25691	J.D.	Can you press "lobby," please?
25692	Doug	GYAAAAAHHHH-DAH!!!
25693	J.D.	OWW!! OWW!! OWW!!! DOUG! Why are you hitting me?!?
25694	Doug	Because I thought you were a dead guy coming back to life!
25695	J.D.	Then why were you hitting me?!
25696	Elliot	There, you are. Come on.
25697	J.D.	No, no! Elliot, I'm not even supposed to be here, I'm going home!
25698	Dr. Cox	So, if I understand correctly, you left my only child with a creepy, borderline psychotic who hates everyone?
25699	Carla	How is that different from leaving him with you?
25700	Dr. Cox	I have freckles.
25701	Janitor	Oil can. Oil can!Thank you.
25702	Dr. Cox	Hey, you. Where's my son?
25703	Janitor	Oh, he's playing with the birds out on the ledge.
25704	Carla	What?!
25705	Janitor	I'm kidding, come on. He's green!
25706	Dr. Cox	Aww, come on.
25707	Janitor	Yeah, the little nipper got hold of a paint gun when I was painting this green line down to the smoker's lounge. Thanks to him, I only got halfway down.
25708	Dr. Kelso	You look familiar. You ever play ball in Pennsylvania? Pepe?
25709	Turk	Mr. Bolger, look, before you throw me out of here, I just want to apologize about earlier. Um, I don't know what I was thinking, but rest assured, from here on out whatever you ask me, I will be completely honest with you.
25710	Mr. Bolger	Do you shave your head because you like the way it looks or because you're going bald?
25711	Turk	Bald.
25712	Mr. Bolger	OK, next question.
25713	Turk	With all those topical treatments, let's just say I wasn't completely functional.
25714	Mr. Bolger	Why are all the surgical residents being so relentless about my son's heart?
25715	Turk	Because whichever one of us convinces you to pull the plug and donate his heart gets to assist in the transplant.
25716	Mr. Bolger	You're talking about my son here. And you don't even know him.
25717	Turk	What's his name?
25718	Mr. Bolger	Ray.
25719	Turk	How you doin', Ray? Now ask me if I think it's the right thing to do, even if you request that I don't assist.
25720	Mr. Bolger	Do you?
25721	Turk	Yes. I'm really sorry.
25722	Elliot	J.D., there is just no way that I'm going to be able to pull this off. In a few hours, I'm going to have a room full of specialists firing questions at me. I gonna be a bigger fraud than Barry Bonds!
25723	J.D.'s Thoughts	OK, you knew he's an athlete of some kind. Just say something general.
25724	J.D.	Still, I love it when Bonds wins at the game that he plays. Look, Elliot, you know how people become specialists? They obsess about the material over and over again until it becomes lodged into their brains. That's exactly what you've been doing. Watch, where's the closest page you've hidden around here?
25725	Elliot	Hmm.
25726	J.D.	Wha-? You are good.
25727	Elliot	Hmm.
25728	J.D.	All right look. What's the leading differential in an obese woman suffering from amenorrhea and hirsutism?
25729	Elliot	Polycystic ovaries. Oh my God, I knew it! Ha! Up here!
25730	Carla	Dr. Cox?
25731	Dr. Cox	Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.
25732	Carla	Why aren't you freaking out? Look at him, your kid's, like, all green and slimy.
25733	Dr. Cox	I suppose it's because when Jordan was pregnant, I mentally prepared myself for her giving birth to something green and slimy.
25734	Carla	Where is Jordan, anyway?
25735	Dr. Cox	The wicked witch of the east wing?
25736	Jordan	Help! I'm melting in here! Anyone, help! I'm melting!
25737	Dr. Cox	So, he's green. Don't beat yourself up, Carla. Come on, so far on my watch, he's gotten stitches, cut his own hair and eaten over four dollars in change. Honestly, if I ever need to feed the parking meter, I just check the diaper, don't I?
25738	Carla	You don't understand. I didn't dump him on the Janitor because I was busy. I dumped him on him because he was working my last nerve and I wanted to smoosh his face. I'm not meant for this.
25739	Dr. Cox	Carla, look at me and Jordan. You know how we hate everyone?
25740	Carla	Yeah.
25741	Dr. Cox	Well, that goes doubly for children. It's true. They're loud, you can't understand them, they're like tiny cab drivers. But, trust me, when you do have your own kid, you won't feel that way.
25742	Carla	Yeah, what what will be different?
25743	Dr. Cox	He'll be yours.
25744	Turk	Sir, I was watching that.
25745	Dr. Kelso	Well, why don't I just tell you what happened? Uncle Phillip gets Webster the dog despite George and Ma'am's objections. It was a good one. Now, on your feet. They need you in the OR to assist on the heart transplant.
25746	Turk	The Bolgers said yes?
25747	Dr. Kelso	Mr. Bolger wanted you to have this.
25748	Turk	His son's driver's license?
25749	Dr. Kelso	Turn it over.
25750	J.D.'s Narration	Every so often, a wizard comes along and tells you exactly what you need to hear.
25751	Dr. Kelso	Seems like you had a heart all along.
25752	Elliot	Superior vena cava?
25753	J.D.	That's right! See? You had the brains all along.
25754	Dr. Cox	Trust me, Carla. When you do have your own kid, you're gonna find that you had the courage to be a parent all along.
25755	Carla	Thank you.
25756	Ted	Somewhere, over the rainbow, way up high, there's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby......Someday I'll wish upon a star, wake up where the clouds are so far behind me......Where troubles melt like lemon drops, high above the chimney tops. That's where you'll find me, somewhere over the rainbow. Blue birds fly over the rainbow.......why, then, oh why can't I?
25757	Dr. Cox	Hey, Dorothy. Going home, are you?
25758	J.D.	Yep!
25759	Ted	If happy little blue birds fly beyond the rainbow, why, oh why can't I?
25760	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
25761	J.D.'s Narration	I was super-psyched to get my scooter, Sasha, back from the shop, but my new scooter insurance hadn't kicked in yet, so I was being extra-cautious.
25762	J.D.	Perfect. Time for my morning slushie.
25763	Officer	Get out of the way! The store's being robbed!Freeze!
25764	J.D.	The wall! Hide behind the wall!NO! Sasha!
25765	Robber	All right! All right! OK.
25766	J.D.	There was a wall! What's the matter with you?Who is still shooting? She's down!It's over!
25767	Patient	Is this gonna hurt?
25768	J.D.	Oh, don't be such a baby, it's a magnetic image. I apologize, Mr. Foster, I'm a little upset. My scooter, Sasha was assassinated this morning.
25769	Turk	Yeah, he was so attached to that thing. He used to wear a bracelet that said "Sasha Forever."
25770	J.D.	Oh come on, Turk, it was just a joke. And I only wore it for one week.
25771	Turk	Whatever.
25772	J.D.	Now let's fire this baby up.OK, so I still wear the bracelet.
25773	Turk	Idiot. OH!My watch.
25774	Ted	HEY, CARLA!
25775	Carla	Earphones, Ted!
25776	Ted	Sorry. Hey, Carla, did you hear that the lottery's up to a hundred million? If I win that baby, it's separate beds for me and my mom.
25777	Carla	Yeah, and you can spend the other 99,999,000 on therapy.
25778	Ted	What would you do with the money?
25779	Elliot	Carla, I can't believe you're going to be a mom!
25780	Carla	I know! It was expensive, but totally worth it.Right, baby?
25781	Turk	Stupid lotto.
25782	Carla	Good morning, Mrs. Wilk.
25783	Mrs. Wilk	Great morning.
25784	Carla	Whoa.
25785	Mrs. Wilk	That is wrong.
25786	Carla	Care to join me in a super loud throat clear?
25787	Mrs. Wilk	Absolutely.
25788	Carla	One, two, three.
25789	Carla & Mrs. Wilk	AHEM!
25790	Carla	Elliot, I can't believe you would do that.
25791	Turk	What did you do?
25792	J.D.	Was it naughty?
25793	J.D.'s Narration	When women want men to completely zone out, there's always one thing they can talk about.
25794	Elliot	You see, uh, yesterday I went shoe shopping and there was this one pair of...
25795	Turk and J.D.'s Thoughts	Shoe shopping.
25796	Elliot	...and they were cute.
25797	Carla	Great, we can talk. What were you thinking?
25798	Elliot	So, we kissed? I've been treating his kid for a week and we just really hit it off, you know? I mean it started off with some pretty innocent flirting, "Hi, I'm Dr. Reid," "Why is there blood in my son's stool?"
25799	J.D.	Huh?
25800	Turk	Whose stool?
25801	Carla	Strappy sandals.
25802	Turk and J.D.'s Thoughts	Shoe shopping.
25803	Carla	Continue.
25804	Elliot's Voiceover	And then I asked where his wife was. He said "she's not with us."
25805	Elliot	And then, you know...bleeeh.
25806	Carla	Cool. Oh, I almost forgot. Lace bra.
25807	J.D.	Were they D's?
25808	Turk	Be specific.
25809	J.D.	Good news, Mr. Foster. The radiologist said your scan is completely clear, but we'd like to keep you here for a few more tests.
25810	Mr. Foster	Whatever you say, doc.
25811	J.D.'s Narration	A lot of weird things can happen in a hospital. Like Doug not getting a dead body out of his bed before rigor mortis sets in.
25812	Doug	Ted, give me a hand. He's not gonna fit in the body bag like this so, uh, lie across his feet and I'm gonna push down his head and straighten him out.
25813	Ted	Fun.
25814	Doug	One, two, three!
25815	Ted	Waaahh! Ooof!
25816	Doug	Ted?
25817	J.D.'s Narration	Still, the weirdest thing is when a really cool guy who's fine and talking to you one minute...
25818	J.D.	...is dead the next. Of course, in hospitals this happens a lot, so you have to shake it off and move on. Except when this happens.
25819	Dr. Cox	Well! If it isn't the four horsewomen of the apocalypse. There's a Morbidity and Mortality conference tomorrow morning to figure out who is responsible for Mr. Foster's death and here's the exciting news. I'm pretty sure it was one of you.
25820	J.D.	You really gotta change that cellphone ring.
25821	Turk	Mom, not now.
25822	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
25823	J.D.'s Narration	So, a patient was dead and one of us was going to be blamed.
25824	J.D.	Dude, you've got to change that cell phone ring.
25825	Turk	You think so, huh? Mom, not now.
25826	J.D.'s Narration	With Morbidity and Mortality conferences, the first question sets the tone for the whole day.
25827	Dr. Kelso	Who the hell ate my scone?
25828	Dr. Cox	That would be me, Bobbo, and it was delicious. My compliments to the little lady.
25829	Dr. Kelso	I made those.
25830	Dr. Cox	I know.
25831	Dr. Kelso	Dorian, you admitted Mr. Foster with coughing and shortness of breath. Is that correct?
25832	J.D.	Yes.Mic check, mic check.Yes.
25833	Dr. Kelso	And then what happened?Dorian. I'm ten feet away from you. Talk.
25834	J.D.	Uh, Mr. Foster had recently flown to India, where had been exposed to an outbreak of pertussis. I was going to check on his labs, but first I had to visit another patient, Mr. Sutton.So, Mr. Sutton, when you came with heartburn, I bet you thought I'd kick your butt right out of here. But not this guy. I admitted you and I stayed up all night studying your EKG because I had a hunch, and no girlfriend. But it was mostly the hunch thing. And that hunch paid off because if I hadn't found that blocked artery, you'd be dead right now.
25835	J.D.'s Thoughts	And here comes the gratitude. The two words every doctor lives to hear.
25836	Mr. Sutton	Later, dude.
25837	J.D.	I can't believe he didn't thank me. You'll thank me when you leave, won't you?
25838	Mr. Foster	I-I don't know. Why are you so needy?
25839	Turk	Dude, he keeps a hug schedule with his friends.
25840	J.D.	Oh, OK, Turk. Looks like someone's getting crossed off their 2:00 spot and getting penciled in for never. How does that feel, does it sting?
25841	J.D.'s Thoughts	He's hurting. Hug him. Hug him now!
25842	Carla	Hey, guys? What would you do with a hundred million dollars?
25843	Dr. Kelso	A hundred million dollars?
25844	Carla	Sir, the super lotto jackpot was up to a hundred million dollars, so earlier that morning...I'm just saying, think of what you could do with that kind of money.
25845	Janitor	I could get a trained shark.
25846	Carla	Why?
25847	J.D.	Thanks for inviting me over, Janitor.
25848	Janitor	Anytime, buddy! Anytime. Wait for him, wait for him.
25849	J.D.	Can opener!
25850	Janitor	The lobster's in the pot! Devour! Devour!
25851	J.D.	Something feels pinchy. WHOA! AAH! WAAAH!! AAAAHH!!
25852	Janitor	Save me a leg.I'm in.
25853	Carla	And you know, we could buy a lot more tickets if you could collect money from everyone.
25854	Janitor	I'll start going through their lockers.
25855	Carla	No, I meant asking them.
25856	Janitor	Seems kind of roundabout, but OK.
25857	Carla	Hey, Dr. Cox. You wanna put in for some lottery tickets?
25858	Dr. Cox	Oh, gosh, Carla, I would. I really would, but you see, I already set fire to a big pile of money just this morning.
25859	Carla	Hey, we have the same chance of winning as anyone else.
25860	Dr. Cox	And the category is, ding, things that have a better chance of happening than you winning the lottery: Tedsky, throw ten seconds on the clock for me, would you please?
25861	Ted	Go.
25862	Dr. Cox	Brain transplants, Britney Spears having another hit record, the Rolling Stones going on a farewell tour and actually meaning it, me caring about anything that happens on Wisteria Lane, Jessica Simpson winning an Oscar, Jessica Alba winning an Oscar, Jessica Simpson becoming Jessica Alba-Simpson...
25863	Ted	Time!
25864	Dr. Cox	Ohh..
25865	Carla	Anyway, that explains why I went into the room and said...What would you do with a hundred million dollars?
25866	J.D.	Me? Floating-Head Doctor.
25867	Turk	Here we go.
25868	J.D.	Yeah, I'd spend the money researching how to successfully separate my head from my body. That way I could literally be in two places at once.
25869	J.D.'s Head	Looking good, Mr. Henderson. Looking real good, Nurse Meyers.Uh-oh, he's flat-lining! Body, come!Dammit! Starting CPR.Oww!
25870	J.D.	Well, there would probably be some kinks to work out initially.
25871	Woman	Where is that whore?
25872	Dr. Kelso	Who's a whore?
25873	Elliot	That'd be me, sir.
25874	Dr. Kelso	Oh, of course. Would you care to elaborate?
25875	Elliot	See, um, yesterday, uh, I went shoe shopping...
25876	Turk's Thoughts	Shoe shopping.
25877	Ted's Thoughts	Shoe shopping.
25878	Audience's Thoughts	Shoe shopping.
25879	Elliot	...and they had a T-strap.
25880	Dr. Cox	Oh, puh-lease. Jordan used to use that one on me all the time. Immune. Watch this. Satin panties!
25881	Elliot	Fine. I was checking on Mrs. Wilk and...Mrs. Wilk, I just wanted to explain to you my behavior before. It's not like I was just making out with some random guy in the hospital, I wouldn't do that. Well, I did that once, there was this Medevac pilot. Actually, he just turned out to be an orderly who got his hands on a helicopter helmet, but this is different. Sure, it could get complicated, he has a son...
25882	Mrs. Wilk	And a wife.
25883	Elliot	I've been making out with a married man while his sick child slept a few feet away! Oh, my God, I've become my mother.You said your wife was dead!
25884	Man	No, I said she wasn't with us. Don't make me out to be a bad guy.
25885	Elliot	Well, you're not a good guy. Good guys don't lie about being single, or about being helicopter pilots. If you're a good guy, you would get in there and tell her what happened.
25886	Man	You're right.
25887	Elliot	Hell, yeah, I am.Wait, what?!
25888	Elliot's Voiceover	You know how, when something horrible happens like a car accident, everything slows down?
25889	Elliot	Noooooooooo!!!
25890	Wife	WHOOOOORRRE!!Where is that whore?
25891	Elliot	Hey, guys. 'Sup?
25892	J.D.	Elliot, would you do me a favor and cover Mr. Foster for me? I have to go to Mr. Sutton's house and get the thank you I deserve.
25893	Carla	You are so obsessing about this.
25894	Turk	It's like the time you were convinced that the cafeteria workers were giving you small waffles. How'd that work out for you?
25895	J.D.	They waffle ironed my foot. But this different, buddy. Look, I need a ride.
25896	Turk	Pass.
25897	J.D.	Oh, pass, huh? Well this is what happened last time you passed.
25898	Elliot	Oh!
25899	Carla	Yi.
25900	J.D.	This is where Sutton lives, right? Let's get in there.
25901	Turk	J.D...Dude?
25902	J.D.	OK. Just back away slowly.Oh no, Turk. They're organized!AAAHH!!
25903	Dr. Cox	Good lord, Bobbo, was that your stomach?
25904	J.D.'s Narration	And there it was. Hope. Dr. Kelso's inability to deal with hunger was legendary. We were as good as home.
25905	Dr. Kelso	I've heard enough. Let's call it and go to lunch.
25906	Dr. Cox	Uh, just hold on! That is not the way it works, Bobbo. This is important, dammit. You sit back down and get on with it.
25907	Dr. Kelso	Perry, I'm in charge here.
25908	Dr. Cox	Ted, give him your sandwich.
25909	Ted	I suppose I could spare a small corner.
25910	Dr. Kelso	All right, everyone just stay where you are and we will be back in um, two minutes.
25911	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
25912	J.D.'s Narration	One sandwich later we got back into it.
25913	Dr. Kelso	And then what happened, Dr. Dorian?
25914	J.D.	Well, sir, fortunately for us ostriches are flightless birds.There goes the sentry. Every three minutes, like clockwork.
25915	Turk	Dude, can I admit something to you? I kind of missed not getting my hug today.
25916	J.D.	Here comes your vanilla bear!
25917	Turk	J.D., J.D., uh, J.D.!
25918	J.D.	Wooohhh!!
25919	Turk	Oh! Dude, don't sweat it. It says here that the ostrich is generally a docile creature.
25920	J.D.	Oh, thank God.
25921	Turk	It also says their kick can kill a man.
25922	J.D.	What?! I'm coming back up!Turk?WAAAAHHH!!Mr. Sutton, I hope this isn't a bad time.
25923	Dr. Kelso	Who cares about Mr. Sutton? So, Dr. Reid, you were covering Mr. Foster.
25924	Elliot	Uh, actually, sir, I was on my way to cover Mr. Foster, but then I stopped in Mrs. Wilk's room, and...
25925	Keith	What are you doing?
25926	Elliot	Don't look at me! Keith, do you see the woman standing outside?
25927	Keith	Yeah, I see her.
25928	Elliot	I made out with her husband this morning!
25929	Keith	That's disgusting.
25930	Elliot	OK, Keith, just get out of here and go do PFT's on Mr. Foster.
25931	Mrs. Wilk	Dr. Reid, why are you hiding? You didn't do anything wrong.
25932	Elliot	If we all win this lottery, then I am using that money to find a decent man.
25933	Priest	You may kiss the bride.
25934	Elliot	Mmm. Mmhmm. Whoa, save it for tonight, big guy.
25935	Groom	Mazel Tov.
25936	Elliot	Ugh, why did I make him Jewish? My parents will kill me.
25937	J.D.	Why ostriches?
25938	Mr. Sutton	They're such majestic creatures, don't you think? And, you know, they're kind of like my children. Plus, I make belts out of their necks.
25939	J.D.	OK look, Mr. Sutton, I'm sure you're wondering why...
25940	Turk	...aaaAAAAHHHHH!!!!
25941	Mr. Sutton	There *is* a door.
25942	J.D.	You OK? Did you try and escape?
25943	Turk	I did escape. There was one waiting in the car.
25944	J.D.	Oh.
25945	Mr. Sutton	That's Leon. Loves car rides. Likes to stick his head out the window and I tell him it's a little too dangerous, but he doesn't listen to me.
25946	J.D.	Mr. Sutton, I cured you and you never thanked me.
25947	Mr. Sutton	Why would I thank you for doing your job? I'm a garbageman. How many times a day do you think I get thanked?
25948	Turk	Six.
25949	Mr. Sutton	You're off by about six.
25950	Turk	Twelve!
25951	Mr. Sutton	I'm starting to see why Leon outfoxed you.
25952	Turk	Stupid bird stole my hat.
25953	J.D.	I just don't see why it's such a big deal for you to say, "hey, doc..." Why did he just walk away like that?
25954	Turk	Uhh..
25955	J.D.	Ruh-roh.
25956	Turk	Don't move.
25957	J.D.	I do admit, he looks pretty phat in your Kango.
25958	Carla	Hey, everybody, they're about to pick the lottery numbers. And remember that when we win, we win as a family.
25959	Janitor	I set aside twenty tickets just for you and I to split.
25960	Carla	Perfect.
25961	Keith	Nurse Espinosa. Mr. Foster's cough is getting worse and Dr. Dorian's gone. Dr. Reid's covering, but she's sort of indisposed.
25962	Carla	Kid, I'm about to become a millionaire. Call Dr. Turk, he's the surgeon on call. You're missing out. I bet there's plenty of things you could do with a hundred million dollars.
25963	Dr. Cox	Aw, come on, you gotta make that shot.
25964	Jordan	Let me out of here! I will kill you!
25965	Dr. Cox	I'm watching the game.
25966	Jordan	Sweetie, you wanna get naughty? Ooh..Oh, yeah.Come on, do it. Do it.
25967	Dr. Cox	Ah, I can wait another day. Button up and watch the game.I gotta call my glass guy.
25968	Elliot	Mrs. Brown, I want you to know how sorry I am for kissing your husband, but we are two women who have both been wronged and both been lied to and the healthiest thing for us to do right now is just to walk away from each other with our dignity intact. Don't you agree?
25969	Mrs. Brown	Do you know what I do with whores? I punch them in the face.
25970	Elliot	Bring it, bitch.
25971	Turk	Dude, are you really gonna sit here all day just to thank your garbageman?
25972	J.D.	Yes! Jabbar'e has been added to the hug schedule. You want to wait with me?
25973	Turk	I can't, I was supposed to be on call five minutes ago.
25974	J.D.'s Narration	This whole experience got me thinking about the nature of gratitude. I guess in the end...
25975	J.D.	...whether you're a doctor or a garbageman...
25976	Dr. Kelso	Dorian. What are you doing?
25977	J.D.	Sorry, sir, uh, um, sometimes I like to just sum things up.
25978	Dr. Kelso	Well, allow me to do that for you. In the end, when Mr. Foster started coughing up blood...
25979	Dr. Kelso's Voiceover	...the on-call surgeon was stuck in traffic......the nursing staff was busy losing the lottery......his original doctor was thanking a garbageman......and the covering physician was incapacitated.
25980	Dr. Kelso	And what was Mr. Foster doing? He was dying in the hands of the interns.How did I do, Dr. Dorian?
25981	Doug	Sorry I'm late. I got the keys to my Miata stuck in the cadaver.
25982	Dr. Cox	Cut to the chase there, Pee Pants.
25983	Doug	Uh, Mr. Foster's death was the result of a pulmonary embolism, probably caused by the 21 hour flight he was on from India. But Dr. Flannery, the radiologist should have caught it on the scan.
25984	Dr. Kelso	Working from an inaccurate report, there was nothing any of you could have done to prevent Mr. Foster from passing. Which, I guess, leads us to you, Dr. Flannery.
25985	J.D.'s Narration	After a day like today, there's only one thing you could do.
25986	J.D.	To bad radiologists!
25987	Dr. Cox	Wait, wait, let me get in on this. Let's also have a toast to Mr. Foster's widow and his fatherless kids.
25988	Elliot	Dr. Cox, it wasn't our fault.
25989	Dr. Cox	Oh. Because you were lucky. You know as well as I do that it could have been any one of your faults. Congrats again. Have a uh, have a swell party.
25990	J.D.'s Narration	It's never easy when someone accuses you of screwing up. Especially when you know it's true.And when that happens, you can't shrug it off. Because the best way to learn from your mistakes is to carry them with you.
25991	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
25992	Todd	What's going on?
25993	Janitor	Ted and I are putting together an air band for that contest at the bar. Someone's got to win those water park tickets, it might as well be us. Lloyd, slammin' solo, but I have to ask you, how's things coming with the drug problem?
25994	Lloyd	Three days sober.
25995	Janitor	Excellent. OK, we'll be in touch.
25996	J.D.	Well, Mrs. Nichols, it was an honor being your doctor.
25997	Mrs. Nichols	Oh, you're such a nice young man. I'd love to set you up with my grand-niece.
25998	J.D.	Oh, thank you, but I'm not big on blind dates, and I know, I haven't hit it in awhile, but there's good reason for that.
25999	Dr. Cox	Two good reasons. His face and his personality.
26000	J.D.	Sticks and stones may break my bones!
26001	J.D.'s Thoughts	But words will hurt forever.
26002	J.D.	Anyway, for me to be set up with your niece, I'd need to know a lot more about her.
26003	Mrs. Nichols	She's single.
26004	J.D.'s Thoughts	My blind date should be here any second. I gotta thank Mrs. Nichols for setting this up.Oh, Mrs. Nichols, you blue-haired bitch! Wait, she's veering off. Phew!OK, Mrs. Nichols, your new hip is on the house because this girl is amazing! Yet there's something accessible about her. I wonder what it is.
26005	Julie	Ooh, I'm gonna have the carrot cake.
26006	J.D.'s Thoughts	So, she was a bit of a klutz.
26007	Julie	Did you see that? Please say no.
26008	J.D.	No.
26009	J.D.'s Narration	From that moment on, it was the greatest date ever. We had so much in common.
26010	Julie	I ride a scooter, I love Harry Potter so much I sometimes wish I was a wizard, and I've hated sports since I was a kid.
26011	J.D.	Me too! Do you ever, like, drift off and have weird fantasies?
26012	Julie	Sometimes.
26013	J.D.	So do you wanna see if they'll give us more coffee or do you just want to call it a night?
26014	J.D.'s Narration	And then she gave the world's best answer.
26015	Julie	Neither.
26016	Elliot	J.D., you home?
26017	J.D.	My roommate. Back in one second.
26018	Elliot	So, I guess your date sucked, huh?
26019	J.D.	Ha! Why don't you ask her if our date sucked. She's in my room.
26020	Elliot	Twenty bucks you blow it in less than five minutes.
26021	J.D.	Unlikely! Because what's waiting for me in my room is what's known in football terms as a slam dunk .
26022	Elliot	One Mississippi, two Mississippi...
26023	Julie	It's so late, I gotta get going, I have a dog and a fish, I have to feed them and walk them and stuff. I'm Julie, hi.
26024	Elliot	I was Elliot. Twenty bucks, please.
26025	J.D.	OK, double or nothing. I bet you I can jump from this couch to the counter. Check it! Eagle!
26026	Elliot	Pay me in the morning.
26027	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26028	J.D.	Why would Julie just take off like that? I bet you my body intimidated her. That's it, I am selling that Bowflex on Craigslist.
26029	Elliot	Yeah, I'm sure you said something that sucked all of the romance out of the moment. You used to do that all the time when we were dating.
26030	J.D.	Like when?Are you getting thicker? You feel a little thicker. What?Fine, I may have told her that she smells like my mom. Which, by the way, I still maintain is a compliment.
26031	Elliot	Ugh.
26032	Jordan	What are you guys talking about?
26033	J.D.	Well...
26034	Elliot	J.D. has this habit...
26035	Jordan	Already bored.Oh, look! Will you say goodbye to Jack? I have to drop him off at preschool.
26036	Dr. Cox	Oh. Bye, little man.
26037	Jordan	Uh, Perry, this is your son, not a rescued pit bull. Give him a kiss.
26038	Dr. Cox	Jordan, he's starting to look like a guy, and I'm just not real big on kissing guys. I mean, if my father wanted to show me affection he would just purposely miss when he threw bottles at my head.
26039	Jordan	You are gonna be a much better dad than your dad was. Now give him a proper goodbye.
26040	Dr. Cox	Son, Always a pleasure. And no more kissing.
26041	Jordan	What? You're crazy! That's right. He is.
26042	Carla	Well, I don't understand, why wouldn't you kiss him?
26043	Dr. Cox	Stay out of it, Carla.
26044	Mrs. Wilk	Stay out of what?
26045	Carla	Dr. Cox won't kiss his son.
26046	Mrs. Wilk	What is wrong with you?
26047	Dr. Cox	Ladies, hate to disappoint, but my quota for women who bug the living bajesus out of me has been met for the next billion years. Now, Mrs. Wilk, you have developed an allergy to Malfolan. However, I have come up with a new regimen that will enable us to continue treatment.
26048	Mrs. Wilk	OK.
26049	Carla	Oh, I think he described all the extra effort he put in just so you would tell him what an amazing doctor he is.
26050	Mrs. Wilk	Now that you've told me, it won't sound sincere.
26051	Carla	He won't care.
26052	Mrs. Wilk	Dr. Cox, you're amazing.
26053	Dr. Cox	It's just my job.
26054	Todd	Everyone's watching to see what you will do / Everyone's looking at you, whoa, Everybody's workin' for...
26055	Janitor	Well, uh, thanks for coming to the audition in costume.
26056	Todd	What costume?
26057	Janitor	Something funny?
26058	Turk	Dude, I just came up the perfect name for you band: Mercy Flush.
26059	Ted	Do you think this is easy?
26060	Janitor	I don't know what "it" is, but he's got it.
26061	Lloyd	He's gonna be trouble.
26062	Janitor	I know. But he is so damn talented.
26063	J.D.'s Narration	I convinced Julie to meet me by explaining that my comment in the bedroom was a simple miscommunication.
26064	J.D.	I wasn't saying that you smelled like my mom, I was saying that you smelled like memum. It's an exotic flower that's indigenous to the hills of Costa Rica.
26065	Julie	God, I feel so stupid.
26066	J.D.	Hugsies.
26067	J.D.'s Thoughts	Ohh, Mommy.
26068	Julie	I'll see you later?
26069	J.D.	Yes.
26070	Julie	Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh, I am so, so sorry.
26071	Elliot	Oh no, it happens.
26072	J.D.	It does, it happens.
26073	Julie	Bye.
26074	J.D.	Isn't she great?
26075	Elliot	So, you got the second date. Just don't repeat the same mistakes you made with me. For instance, don't speed down the road and pretend your brakes are out. I don't care if it got you laid once in high school. It is not funny, and I still have not forgiven you for killing that family's pony. But most importantly, if you ever find yourself in a romantic situation again, ignore whatever pops into your head. Just look into her eyes and say these exact words: I'm. So glad. I found you.
26076	J.D.	You're telling me what to say, next you're gonna be telling me how to kiss her. I mean, where does it end?
26077	Julie	You are such a good kisser, J.D.
26078	Elliot	Mmm, right back at'cha. And I love that you're calling me J.D.
26079	J.D.	Stay away from my girlfriend, Elliot. And stay away from my J.D. wigs!
26080	Lonnie	Dr. Cox, could you help me with a central line?
26081	Dr. Cox	Fine, Lonnie, but hand to God, if you so much as look at me for the next month I will mummify your head in surgical tape.
26082	Lonnie	Thank you Dr. Cox. Is he gone? No? Hello?
26083	Carla	Mrs. London, this is Dr. Cox. He's going to be your doctor.
26084	Dr. Cox	Good news. Your intestinal bleeding can be fixed with a very simple surgery.
26085	Mrs. London	Surgery? I'm a Jehovah's witness, I can't get a transfusion. We believe that blood should not be passed from person to person.
26086	Dr. Cox	Well, I'm a doctor, and we believe that without surgery, a patient in your condition can suffer from a major case of deadness.
26087	Carla	Don't worry, he'll figure out another way to treat you.
26088	Dr. Cox	Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha, no he won't!
26089	J.D.	I am having so much fun hanging out with you. Can you believe we've been talking for two hours?
26090	Julie	Seriously?
26091	J.D.	Nah, while you were in the bathroom I set the clock two hours ahead so you'd think time was just flying by.
26092	Julie	Really? While I was in the bathroom, I wrote my name on the mirror with my finger so the next time you took a hot shower and it fogged up, you'd think that ghosts where trying to tell you to be with me.
26093	J.D.'s Narration	Looking at her, I knew what the future held for Julie and me.
26094	J.D.	Smile.
26095	Julie	Oh, God this mask is hot.
26096	J.D.	Thanks for doing that.I wanted a picture of us old, you know? That way if one of us dies in a tragic skiing accident, we'll always have that memory of us together.
26097	Julie	That's so sweet! So what do you want to do now?
26098	J.D.'s Thoughts	OK, romance is in the air. You gotta say something. Tell her about the hit and run. Nah, she probably loves ponies. Ask her if she's been tested. Why are all these odd thoughts popping into my head? My, God, look at the size of her feet. Tell her! Stop it! OK, the silence is going on too long. Just say that thing that Elliot told you, even though it's stupid.
26099	J.D.	I'm really glad I found you.
26100	Turk	...To liiiiive!!
26101	Janitor	Yes! That was very tight.
26102	Dr. Kelso	Well, seems I've stumbled into the Time Well Spent ward. Back into your cage, Ted.
26103	Ted	Oh, God, what have I done?
26104	Dr. Kelso	Turkleton, I need you to volunteer to speak at a critical care conference this weekend.
26105	Turk	Yeah, I don't see that happening, Bobby.
26106	Dr. Kelso	Excuse me?
26107	Turk	It's not like you're the king around here.
26108	J.D.	Ahhhh, morning, Elliot. By the way, Julie's here. I'm not gonna kiss and tell.
26109	Elliot	Oh, really? Because I just got your text that said bone city.
26110	J.D.	Oh, really? That came through?
26111	J.D.'s Narration	When you care about something, the last thing you want is for it to be taken away.Whether it's a newfound hobby...
26112	Turk	Sir, why did you want to see me in here?
26113	Dr. Kelso	Quick announcement, people. From this moment on, there will be no air-banding allowed in the hospital. The king has spoken. Thank you very much.
26114	J.D.'s Narration	...or the image of someone you looked up to.
26115	Carla	So, tell me. What are you gonna do with our Jehovah's Witness?
26116	Dr. Cox	I'm not gonna do anything.
26117	Carla	So what's gonna happen?
26118	Dr. Cox	I would say she's probably going to die.
26119	J.D.'s Narration	as for me, all I lost was my pride.
26120	Julie	Hey, Elliot. Oh, um, J.D.? I'm glad I found you, too.
26121	Elliot	Well, that sounds familiar.
26122	Julie	HYOOOOOO!Ow. I think there's a chotchkie in my bum.
26123	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26124	J.D.'s Narration	So I had to use Elliot's advice with Julie. Luckily, she's not great at gloating.
26125	Elliot	Ha ha, you had sex last night with a beautiful girl that you really like!
26126	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes she needs a little help.
26127	J.D.	Uh, you probably meant, "If it weren't for you, I'd still be dating my laptop."
26128	Elliot	Right. In your face, ha ha! Thank you. You know, I actually like Julie, so don't do that thing you always do.
26129	J.D.	If you're referring to the game Find the Saltine, relax. I don't even play that with Turk any more.
26130	Elliot	No, I am talking about how you go a million miles an hour the minute you fall for someone. Don't go too quickly, or just like I said, you'll just end up with another beautiful girl.
26131	J.D.	Dating my laptop.
26132	Elliot	Dating you laptop. Thank you.
26133	Lloyd	I knew he'd be trouble.
26134	Janitor	Hey, come on now, we're still a band, huh? Let's bring it in.Cool cats on three. One, two, three.
26135	Janitor, Ted & Lloyd	Cool cats!
26136	Janitor	Let's roll.
26137	Carla	When Mrs. Wilk was allergic to Malfolan, you found a way around it. Why aren't you doing the same for our Jehovah's Witness?
26138	Dr. Cox	Because Mrs. Wilk didn't choose to have her allergy, so...
26139	Carla	Wait, there's a young man behind you with a quick medical question.
26140	Jordan	Will you kiss me?
26141	Dr. Cox	Leaving.
26142	Jordan	You know, you're eventually gonna have to kiss your boy.
26143	Carla	And you will have to treat that Jehovah's Witness.
26144	Jordan	Mmhmm.
26145	Dr. Cox	God. Elevator.He's got my back, Even if I don't technically believe in Him.
26146	Turk	Behind your ear.
26147	J.D.	My friend, you have found the saltine! But don't tell Elliot we're still playing!
26148	J.D.'s Thoughts	Why do I care what Elliot thinks? She's not right about everything. I mean, I'm not gonna go too fast with Julie.
26149	J.D's Thoughts	Ooh, land for sale.
26150	Turk	Dr. Kelso? I'll go to that conference.
26151	Dr. Kelso	Turkleton, I have many more pressing issues, starting with a gigantic paralyzed wife and ending with a gay son who has just written a scathing musical about me called "Dr. Dad" which,
26152	Janitor	It was never about you saying no to the conference. It's about the way you said it.You see that man there? His biggest pet peeve, except for employees storing deer meat in his office mini-fridge, is people being disrespectful to him.
26153	Turk	Do you play?
26154	Carla	Lonnie, what are you doing?
26155	Lonnie	Since Dr. Cox won't treat Mrs. London, we have to transfer her to another facility.
26156	Dr. Cox	All right, listen up and listen good. I will kill anyone who tells Carla about this. That includes you Mrs. London. First, I will save your life, then I'll take it away. Let's get to work. Lonnie. Are you looking at me again?
26157	Lonnie	No.
26158	Julie	Are we crazy to be thinking about buying this?
26159	J.D.	No, it's a sound investment and a great addition to my portfolio.
26160	J.D.'s Thoughts	Which consists of two shares of Eastern Airlines stock and a pack of unopened Les Mis trading cards.
26161	Elliot	J.D., this is a mistake.
26162	J.D.	You're not broker of the year Whit Prowdy.
26163	Elliot	Don't do this, you're going too fast.
26164	J.D.	Why should I believe you?
26165	Elliot	Because honesty is my business.
26166	J.D.	I hate you, Whit Prowdy.
26167	Turk	Sir, can I talk to you for a second?
26168	Dr. Kelso	Just you, or all the Turkleton's?
26169	Janitor	We don't just rock together, we roll together.
26170	Janitor, Ted, Turk & Lloyd	Cool Cats.
26171	Turk	Sir, I want to apologize for how I spoke to you. It was extremely disrespectful and I can promise you, it will not happen again.
26172	Dr. Kelso	You bet your ass it won't.
26173	Carla	OK, so what's the deal, crankypants?
26174	Dr. Cox	I am just sick and tired of having to live up to everyone's expectations. Lonnie needs a central line. You want me to help Mrs. London, and every patient in this dump looks at me for some miracle cure. I mean, honestly, Carla, with Jehovah as my witness, sometimes it is just too much.
26175	Carla	Yeah, yeah. I'm not buying it. You've been putting up with that stuff around here for over twenty years.
26176	Dr. Cox	It's not just here, it's home, too. Jordan expects me to be this this amazing, sensitive father.
26177	Carla	So that's what this is about? You shouldn't sweat the sensitive dad stuff. You'll get there.
26178	Dr. Cox	You don't know anything.
26179	Carla	Oh really? How is it going with your Jehovah's Witness patient?
26180	Dr. Cox	Better.
26181	J.D.	How did you know I'd move too fast with Julie?
26182	Dr. Cox	How do you know that I can be that kind of Dad?
26183	Turk	How did you know that Dr. Kelso just wanted respect?
26184	Elliot	Because I know you.
26185	Carla	Because I know you.
26186	Janitor	Because I know him.
26187	Todd	This is so cool.
26188	Lonnie	What's happening? Dr. Cox didn't make eye holes.
26189	J.D.'s Narration	I think it's important to listen to the people who know us best. Because if you do, you might get to rock......you might get the confidence to be the father you want to be...
26190	Dr. Cox	Give me this little boy.I love you. I love you so much I'm gonna make a sandwich out of you.
26191	Jordan	Where are you going?
26192	Dr. Cox	Jack's gonna devour me now, see you later!
26193	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, sometimes it's fun to not listen and do whatever the hell you want.
26194	J.D.	So, we bought it. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to kiss my lady on my new half-acre.
26195	Elliot	She is not graceful.
26196	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26197	J.D.'s Narration	Behold Julie Quinn. Ahhhh. We fell for each other so quickly, we decided to buy some property together, and built a deck on it.
26198	J.D.	To our half-acre.
26199	Julie	Hey, look, the Clarks are home.
26200	J.D.'s Narration	Unfortunately, the Clarks felt that if we weren't building a house, we weren't technically their neighbors.
26201	J.D. & Julie	Hey, Clarks!
26202	Mr. Clark	Go to hell!
26203	J.D.	OK! Hey, Buzz, I'm gonna beat you in poker next time!
26204	J.D.'s Narration	The Morgans on the other side were much friendlier. But I don't think we're gonna have them over again.
26205	J.D.	Hi.
26206	Mr. Morgan	Y'all are a cute couple.
26207	Julie	Thanks.
26208	Mr. Morgan	Wanna buy a baby?
26209	J.D.	Oooh, sweetie!
26210	Julie	No.
26211	J.D.	I'm sorry, no thank you.
26212	Mr. Morgan	I'll throw in a crib.
26213	J.D.	Throwing in a crib.
26214	J.D.'s Narration	It didn't matter, because I was happy to look out at my beautiful half-acre with my sweet, but klutzy gal.
26215	J.D.	You OK, buttercup?
26216	Julie	The glass broke in my mouth.
26217	J.D.'s Narration	Turk and I had discovered a new way to deal with Kelso's bad moods.
26218	Dr. Kelso	Dammit, people, if you can't fill out your patients' insurance forms, then...
26219	Turk	Spoonful of peanut butter, sir?
26220	J.D.'s Narration	It usually bought us a few minutes of peace. But then Carla said something that deeply disturbs every man on God's green earth.
26221	Carla	I just got my period.This really sucks. I've been trying to get pregnant for two months now.
26222	J.D.	I almost bought a baby yesterday.
26223	Carla	What?
26224	J.D.'s Thoughts	Don't tell them, in case you want it later!
26225	J.D.	Nothing.
26226	Turk	Don't worry about it, baby, we'll just keep trying. Remember that magazine article I read about how important it is for a man to have a high-protein diet?
26227	Carla	Turk, for the last time, you are not eating ribs while we do it.
26228	Turk	You never let me have no fun!
26229	Janitor	You know, I'm not gonna have a kid until that genetic technology they've been talking about is available for everyone.
26230	Carla	So you'd want to pick the sex and eye color?
26231	Janitor	No. Gills. When that day comes it's goodbye, hospital, hello father-son treasure hunting team.
26232	Carla	Wow. Well, you better get cracking. What are you, like, 45?
26233	Janitor	43. I know I look a little older, but that's because I drink and smoke heavily, and work with chemicals, and sleep on my face.
26234	Carla	No hard feelings?
26235	Janitor	All right.I swear on my unborn fish-boy's life, she will pay.
26236	Dr. Kelso	I need some milk.
26237	Orderly	Yo, Glass Man!
26238	J.D.	What's Glass Man?
26239	Turk	It's a basketball thing, I'm a great rebounder.
26240	J.D.	You know who else is a great rebounder? Dr. Mickhead.His wife was killed on Saturday.
26241	Dr. Mickhead	Hey, guys.
26242	Turk & J.D.	Hey, Mickhead!
26243	Turk	The police cleared him yet?
26244	J.D.	He's still a person of interest.
26245	J.D.'s Narration	There was sexual energy everywhere.For the women, it was because of the dashing new gynecologist, Dr. Matthews.
26246	Dr. Cox	Jordan, why would you need seven pap smears in one month?
26247	Jordan	I got a lot of pap. Move your head so I can see.
26248	J.D.'s Narration	And for the men, there was a new, sexy Latina nurse: Nurse Martinez.
26249	Nurse Martinez	Would you guys stop doing that?
26250	J.D.'s Narration	Yep, there was eye candy for all. And only one thing could upset this delicate balance.
26251	Janitor	Wow. She looks like a young Carla.
26252	J.D.	That's why they call him the glass man.
26253	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26254	J.D.'s Narration	Julie and I had overslept. We didn't have time for our usual seven minutes of love-making, so we had to fake it.
26255	Julie	Ohh, yeah! Don't stop!
26256	J.D.	Pull my hair! Whee!
26257	Julie	Shut up and take it, you stupid bitch!
26258	J.D.	OK, we can stop there. Um, now it's time to ring the sex gong.
26259	Julie	What?
26260	J.D.	Uh, Turk and I got sex gongs in Chinatown. We're supposed to ring them whenever each one of us gets lucky. And even though I don't live with him anymore, I like to think that somewhere, somehow he hears it and it makes him happy.
26261	Julie	That's so funny.
26262	Turk	Yeah, buddy! Ha ha! That's my dog.
26263	J.D.	Hope my gong wasn't too loud for you this morning. I know it can be. It's a loud gong! I mean, it's like, gonnggg!
26264	Elliot	J.D., I knew you were faking it because at the end you didn't say "bombs away."
26265	J.D.	How could I forget my sexiest move?
26266	J.D.'s Thoughts	Great, now Julie thinks I'm lame, and weird and pathetic.
26267	Elliot	J.D., she likes you. Just do yourself a favor and stay out of your head for once.
26268	J.D.'s Thoughts	OK, from this moment on, I am officially out of my head.
26269	Carla's Thoughts	Ugh, I'm an old hag. I mean look at her, everything's so tight and perky. Come on, Carla, it's not her fault. Just do what you always do and turn the other cheek. And quietly spread the rumor that she's a guy.
26270	Carla	Hey, Turk, guess what.
26271	Turk	She's not a guy, honey. Besides, "young Carla" is a compliment.
26272	Carla	Really? So how would you feel if said, "hey, it's skinny Turk?"
26273	Carla's Thought's	And now his boyfriend will comfort him.
26274	J.D.	Don't listen to her, brown bear, your body is fierce!
26275	Turk	Is it?
26276	J.D.	Like Taye Diggs'!
26277	Turk	Taye Diggs.
26278	Carla's Narration	Luckily, I had a best friend, too.
26279	Elliot	So, uh, what did "her" name used to be?
26280	Carla	Hm, how about Alberto?
26281	Elliot	I'll spread the word.
26282	Carla	Alberto.
26283	Turk	So when am I gonna get to meet Julie?
26284	J.D.	Do I want her to meet Turk this soon? What if he doesn't like her?
26285	Turk	What are you doing?
26286	J.D.	I'm saying all my thoughts out loud so I don't mess this relationship up.
26287	Turk	I don't understand.
26288	J.D.	I forgot, sometimes Turk is slow. You know what? It's time for her to meet the people in my life. I think she's gonna do great.
26289	Julie	Did you know J.D.'s parents thought he was going to be a girl? They didn't have a name ready when he was born, so until he was three years old they called him Joanna.
26290	Dr. Cox	I don't know who you are, but thank you for this.
26291	Dr. Mickhead	So what do you think?
26292	Julie	Sure, I guess I can hide this in my basement for you.
26293	Dr. Mickhead	OK, great, great.
26294	J.D.	You know what, let's just give that back. Thanks, nice to see you Mickhead.
26295	Turk	Look, Julie, I'm very protective of J.D. So it's going to take a lot for you to win me over.
26296	Julie	Uh, J.D. wanted me to introduce you to my godfather.
26297	Billy Dee Williams	Yeah, Julie's a great girl.
26298	Turk	YAAAAHHAAHAAAA HHAAHAAA! Lando Calrissian! Come here!
26299	Billy Dee Williams	Oh, you can call me Billy Dee.
26300	Turk	Yes, Lando. Yes.
26301	Elliot	Look, Julie, you already won Carla and me over because you're nice to J.D. And you won Jordan over because you bought the first round.
26302	Carla	I got lemon drops!
26303	Elliot	Oh, Carla, the last time I did one of those I agreed to go on a date with a chick in my Art History class. Mm-mm.
26304	Jordan	Yeah, can we go somewhere less college-y? One of the boys here could be the baby I gave up in high school.
26305	Carla	We aren't too old to hang out here. Come on.
26306	Elliot	Mmmm...
26307	Carla's Thoughts	OK, time to dial up the Spanish. That always makes them feel guilty that they haven't spent more time around minorities.
26308	Carla	Come on, mis amigas, we don't have to vámonos, pretty please?
26309	Jordan	All right.
26310	Julie	All right.
26311	Elliot	Let's do it.
26312	Carla	To being young!You guys, for real, you're my best friends.
26313	Elliot	So, Carol, did you like jazz?
26314	Carol	Ha ha, yeah!
26315	Elliot	How much?
26316	Dr. Cox	Aaand, look what we have here. It is a visual representation of how alcohol affects people of different ages. We have the young...
26317	Julie	Good morning!
26318	Dr. Cox	...the slightly older...
26319	Elliot	Please stop talking.
26320	Dr. Cox	...the slightly older still......and lastly, the very, very, very old. She is unconscious and virtually unwakable. Witness:Jordaroo! Jordalicious! Jordaroni! Uh-huh.
26321	J.D.	Ha! We'll get you ladies some more coffee. Jordan, if you're willing to pay for it, just sit there frozen. How very generous.
26322	Julie	That's so funny!
26323	J.D.	Yeah.
26324	Turk	Dude, Julie's awesome.
26325	J.D.	Doesn't it bother you that she never laughs at anything?
26326	Turk	What do you mean?
26327	J.D.	I mean when something's funny she never laughs. She just says "that's so funny." It's kind of annoying.
26328	Turk	J.D., this is an intervention. First off, I just want to say everyone here loves you. This is a safe space. But you are such a commit-ophobe. Every time you date a girl with actual potential, you wind up ruining it over some trivial reason. Let's think about some of the great girls you let slip through your fingers: Kylie, Jamie, Gift Shop Girl, Mini McSkinny, Mole Butt, Tina Two-Kids, Rumple Fugly, I'm forgetting someone.
26329	Carla's Thought's	Oh, my God, Turk, if you forget Elliot, she's going to cry.
26330	Carla	Turk, aren't you forgetting the greatest girl of them all?
26331	Turk	Heidi Horseface!
26332	Elliot	Me! Turk, she is talking about me. OK?
26333	J.D.	Relax, Elliot. You're Mole Butt.
26334	Elliot	Really? Ha! Sorry, Turk.
26335	Carla	J.D. There's somebody else here who wants to say something.
26336	Billy Dee Williams	Hey, don't mess this up, man. Be smooth.
26337	Turk	Lando's right.
26338	Billy Dee Williams	Billy Dee!
26339	Turk	Lando.
26340	Dr. Cox	Joanna, now I'm not much for this sensitive crap, but darn it all, you've finally found someone who's willing to let you annoy them instead of me.
26341	Elliot	Don't screw this up J.D., or you're going to end up where you always do. Lying on that couch in the fetal position, wishing you hadn't driven another one away.
26342	Dr. Cox	If Jordan were conscious, she'd she'd agree. Aw, now who put that fake arrow through her head? Huh? Which one of you? It was me. I did it.
26343	J.D.	I gotta get cooking. People are going to be here for this barbeque any second.
26344	Julie	So your friends really like me?
26345	J.D.	They're crazy about you. They're worried I'm gonna mess this whole thing up.
26346	Julie	Nah. You're not gonna be a jerk and do something like that, are you?
26347	J.D.	The only jerk around here is the spicy marinade on this Jamaican chicken, mon.
26348	Julie	That's so funny.
26349	J.D.	It is, Julie, it it is. Why do you always do that?
26350	Julie	Do what?
26351	J.D.	Well you never laugh when something's funny. You just say "that's so funny."
26352	Julie	Does that bother you?
26353	Janitor	Don't mean to bother anybody. I'm just showing Nurse Martinez here around the hospital. That is our Chief of Medicine, that is a patient, and that is you in twenty years. OK, let's go look at dead people.
26354	Carla	That nurse makes me feel so damn old.
26355	Dr. Kelso	Oh, calm down, Nurse Espinosa. I have it on good authority that she's a dude.
26356	Carla	I made that stuff up.
26357	Dr. Kelso	Then it's time for her to meet Bob Kelso, licensed hetero.
26358	Mrs. Wilk	Sweetie, you're not old. You don't have crows feet, your bra size hasn't gone from a 34B to a 40 long, and you don't have arthritis. Neither do I, but that's how it gets you.
26359	Carla's Narration	And then Mrs. Wilk said something that really surprised me.
26360	Mrs. Wilk	I mean, it's not like you're trying to get pregnant and you can't.
26361	Carla	Actually, I am.
26362	Mrs. Wilk	Oh.
26363	Carla's Narration	Of course, none of us were surprised that J.D. made this happen.
26364	Elliot	Why is Julie behind that bush, crying?
26365	J.D.	Who knows? Could be anything.You know what's interesting, Turk? She's not saying "that's so sad," she's actually crying.
26366	Turk	You're an idiot.
26367	J.D.	Yes, I am.
26368	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26369	Carla's Thoughts	I tried, but I just couldn't get babies off my mind.
26370	J.D.	Excuse me, fellas, gotta take a whiz. Wait a minute, why am I rushing? All right.
26371	Carla	You're disgusting.
26372	J.D.	She's right. I am disgusting. I am disgustingly incapable of carrying on a relationship with someone I actually like. I mean, I apologized to her, so I think we're cool for now, but it won't last. Every time she says "that's so funny" it's - it's like nails on a chalkboard to me.
26373	Turk	Well you're just too picky about women.
26374	J.D.	You used to be the same way. Somehow you got over it and now you're married.
26375	Turk	That's because I was never as bad as you.
26376	J.D.	Oh, really? Remember Whitney the snapper?
26377	Turk	Ugh.Hey, I just wanted to say thanks for dinner tonight.
26378	Whitney	And for dessert, you're going to get a little Whitney a la mode.
26379	Turk	Get out.It's...too much.
26380	Elliot	Carla, you've only been off the pill for two months. Why are you getting a fertility test?
26381	Carla's Thoughts	Because I'm old and the crock pot is on the fritz.
26382	Carla	No reason.
26383	Nurse	Carla Espinosa?
26384	Carla	Yes?
26385	Nurse	Dr. Matthews will see you now.
26386	Elliot	Oh! OK, he is super cute, so do not look into his eyes. You could get lost.
26387	Carla	I'll be fine.
26388	Elliot	Ask him if he remembers me from my pelvic exam! Ask him!
26389	Julie	I made popcorn!
26390	J.D.	You OK, sweetness?
26391	Julie	I'll go make some more.
26392	J.D.	All right. Why are we watching a movie again?
26393	Turk	It's called immersion therapy. What we're about to watch is going to make her say "that's so funny" so many times that eventually it's not going to bother you anymore.
26394	J.D.	But how can you guarantee that she's going to laugh at this movie?
26395	Turk	I can't. But Uncle Buck can.
26396	Julie	That's so funny. That's so funny. Look how big that pancake is, that's so funny.
26397	J.D.	Make. Her. Stop.
26398	Julie	That's so funny.
26399	Carla's Thoughts	This guy's not that hot.
26400	Dr. Matthews	Well, you've only been trying for two months, so I don't think you need to worry about a fertility test yet. Unless, of course, you're over 35.
26401	Carla's Thoughts	Well, buddy, I'm 36 and OK with it.
26402	Dr. Matthews	So how old are you?
26403	Carla's Thoughts	Ravish me!
26404	Carla	I'm 29.
26405	Dr. Matthews	Yeah, I've been seeing a lot of 29 year-olds lately.
26406	Carla	Oh, my God, really?
26407	Dr. Matthews	Like her.
26408	Jordan	Call me JJ.
26409	J.D.	The immersion therapy didn't work.
26410	Turk	Dude, relax. I was a Psych minor in college. The next time she says "that's so funny," I want you to pretend she says "that's so money."
26411	J.D.	Oooh. I like that.
26412	Turk	Yeah. It's called a word replacement...ism.
26413	Dr. Cox	This is the dumbest conversation I've ever heard.
26414	Dr. Kelso	You should hear this one.
26415	Elliot	Oh, I remember my first exam with Dr. Matthews. He said "you're very healthy down there." And then I said "right back at'cha." And then there was this weird, little awkward pause, so I said "well, I like to keep a clean shop," and then he asked to see my insurance card. So how did your fertility test go?
26416	Carla	He said everything's A-OK.
26417	Dr. Kelso & Dr. Cox	Oh, that's bull!
26418	Turk	Excuse me, sir?
26419	Dr. Kelso	I was talking to these ladies.
26420	Dr. Cox	I was talking to you ladies. Newbie, listen to me. You never stop being annoyed by the little things, ever. Take, uh, take Gandhi, here. Your wife is the bossiest women I've ever met. You're trying to tell me that you're not bothered by that anymore?
26421	Turk	Sometimes I watch Roots to remind myself how good I have it.
26422	J.D.	Me too.
26423	Dr. Cox	Everyone is annoying. I mean, take take Jordan. She is just now returning from what I can only assume is her eleventh gynecological visit this month.
26424	Jordan	I'm saving my breast exam for when you go away next month.
26425	Dr. Cox	Upsetting, but we persevere. Bottom line, there's no such thing as a perfect person. You, tell her.
26426	Turk	All right, if you've found someone who makes you happy just sitting around holding hands, then eventually all that other stuff won't matter.Dude, not me.
26427	J.D.	I know.
26428	Dr. Kelso	Nurse Espinosa, I know you didn't take that fertility test. People think I am some clueless old geezer, but nothing that happens in these hallways gets by me.
26429	Dr. Mickhead	It wasn't me! I didn't do it!
26430	Carla	It's just that if I take that fertility test and I found out that I missed my window to have a kid, I'll never forgive myself.
26431	Dr. Kelso	If you're worried about your biological legacy, as the father of a son who not only wrote a musical based on my life but is currently shacked up with the actor playing me, honestly, sweetheart, it's not all it's cracked up to be. But I know you. You'll find out eventually. So why don't you just turn around and tell him?
26432	Carla	Oh. Dr. Matthews? I'm 36.
26433	Dr. Matthews	Oh. Well let's get you that fertility test.
26434	Carla	OK.
26435	Carla's Thoughts	Here goes nothing.
26436	J.D.	Ha ha. One-a-day vitamins. I'll tell you how they could double their profits: Two-a-day vitamins.
26437	Julie	That's so funny! I'm sorry I said "that's so funny," I know that drives you crazy.
26438	J.D.	You know what? I really couldn't care less.
26439	Julie	So what do we do now?
26440	J.D.	I don't know. I mean, we already got the half-acre, right? And I imagine we'll eventually be able to build a house on it, and a little backyard, room for a slip and slide for our kids, Gilligan and The Skipper. I know, I'm sorry, I gotta do it, I lost a bet to Turk. And I don't want to rush things, but I feel good about this. I don't know, I feel like you and I could go the distance.
26441	Julie	Um, actually I meant what do you want to order from take-out for dinner?
26442	J.D.	Oh. Tapas.
26443	Julie	I love tapas.
26444	J.D.	Great for sharing.
26445	Julie	Sharing is fun.
26446	J.D.	I love it. Just share and...
26447	Julie	Share.
26448	J.D.	So you really don't think about that kind of stuff?
26449	Julie	J.D., I'm only 23, and I don't even know if I want any of that stuff, and certainly not for the five or ten years.
26450	J.D.	You know what? We've just started dating, so I have a feeling this conversation goes down a really bad road. Why don't we just say we're never going to talk about it ever again, OK?
26451	Julie	OK.
26452	J.D.	OK.
26453	Julie	OK. Whew.
26454	J.D.	OK. So you really feel that way?So here I am again. I can't believe I broke up with her. Why do I keep doing this?
26455	Elliot	J.D., this was totally different. You didn't break up with her because she said "that's so funny," or because she was like Mini McSkinny and singing Christmas carols in the summertime.
26456	J.D.	It was August! The weather was far from frightful!
26457	Turk	You broke up with her for a real reason. Right, Carla?
26458	Carla	Definitely.
26459	Carla's Thoughts	Oh, my God, what did I just agree to? All I can think about is getting my test results back. I have to get out of my head. Just say something positive.
26460	Carla	She's a keeper, J.D.! You'll never do better.
26461	J.D.'s Narration	I guess it's in our nature to think about the future. Especially if our dreams might not come true.
26462	Carla	Thanks. Thanks, Dr. Matthews, that's great news!Turk!
26463	Turk	Yeah, baby?
26464	Carla	Get over here.
26465	J.D.	Yeah, buddy!
26466	J.D.'s Narration	As for my future, I had finally gotten to the place where I was looking for the right person. And I knew she was out there. Even if I couldn't quite see her yet.
26467	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26468	J.D.'s Narration	It's been a week, but for some reason, I'm still having trouble moving past my break-up with Julie. Luckily my roommate knows how to take care of me.
26469	J.D.	Nice! Now it's a picture of you and me on a unicorn.
26470	Elliot	J.D., that's Gary Busey.
26471	J.D.	It's uncanny!
26472	J.D.'s Narration	Now that we lived together, Elliot and I were getting tighter every day.
26473	Elliot	AAAAHHH!! OH!! OH, MY GOD, THAT'S COLD!! AAAHHH!!! J.D.!!!
26474	J.D.'s Narration	She wasn't great at practical jokes.But still, we'd become inseparable.
26475	Elliot	Thanks for the ride, buddy! See you upstairs!Todd, gun show!
26476	Todd	Don't worry, ma'am, I got permits for these. Go ahead and touch them, the safety's on. Doosh!
26477	Patient	I keep getting lightheaded and passing out but you haven't seen it because it only happens when I yawn.
26478	Dr. Cox	No problem. Newbie, quick, tell him a story.
26479	J.D.	Lay off Bob, OK? I'm still upset about this whole Julie thing...You know in high school once, there was a...Hope that hurt.
26480	Dr. Cox	Totally worth it. Now, I need one of you two clowns to do a neurological workup on this guy. It's going to be a giant pain in the ass.
26481	Elliot	Hm.
26482	Dr. Cox	Hmm, Newbie. Looks like it's you. All the best.
26483	J.D.	Damn those roller blades. OK, everybody, let's gather round.
26484	J.D.'s Narration	After six months on the job, some interns can become completely overwhelmed.
26485	J.D.	Where's Rex?
26486	Jason	He's gone fetal again.
26487	J.D.	Put a blankie on him.
26488	Keith	I've got it!
26489	J.D.'s Narration	Unfortunately, young Keith had become competent so quickly that every word out of his chiseled mouth came tainted with an arrogant smugness that he couldn't hide no matter how hard he tried.
26490	Keith	Is there anything else I can do, Dr. Dorian?
26491	J.D.'s Narration	Right on cue.
26492	J.D.	No, Keith. All I need right now is a sip of your coffee to make me feel warm in my belly.Aww, Keith, look what you did!
26493	Keith	Dr. Dorian, take my shirt.
26494	J.D.	You think you're better than me? With your rock-hard abs, and your dynamite areolas? You're not.
26495	Jason	Dr. D, what's on your back?
26496	J.D.	Those, Jason, are the panicked scratches of the adolescent raccoon. Though until animal control can get into my home, it's currently residing in my sock drawer.I got this! Start it, Grandma!
26497	Elliot	OK.
26498	Janitor	Hm?Mmhmm.Woohoo! That was close.
26499	J.D.	Ugh.
26500	Keith	You OK, Dr. Dorian?
26501	J.D.	Keith, it's like you're begging me to hate you.
26502	Keith	I don't feel like I am.
26503	J.D.	You can't stop, can you?
26504	Dr. Cox	Newbie, today!
26505	J.D.'s Narration	We were both a little edgy because our favorite patient, Mrs. Wilk, had developed a lung infection and needed to be intubated for a week. So basically, we had to put her in a coma. Of course, at her age, there's always a chance that she'll never wake up.
26506	J.D.	A whole week of sleep. You're gonna have some killer bed head. I'm nervous, I'm sorry, I love bed head, look, check this.
26507	Dr. Cox	Marge, the patient should not have to be braver than you.
26508	Mrs. Wilk	Go easy on him, he's my fellow. Now listen. If this doesn't work, I want you to just let me go. Don't let me linger.
26509	J.D.'s Narration	Even though you'd think we'd all be used to this kind of stuff by now, when a patient has been around for a while, it gets to everyone., no matter how long they've been here.
26510	Dr. Kelso	Turkleton, you're a surgeon, when did you ever deal with Mrs. Wilk?
26511	Mrs. Wilk	You're not extending your arm. It's called "pop and lock," Christopher, not "pop and dangle."
26512	Turk	OK.
26513	Mrs. Wilk	OK?
26514	Turk	Oh! OK! Uh-huh!
26515	Mrs. Wilk	You're getting it now, baby! You're getting!
26516	Turk	I'll see you later, baby!
26517	Mrs. Wilk	Little Michael! Little Michael!
26518	Turk	Changed my life.
26519	J.D.	All right. Here we go. See you in a couple days.
26520	Mrs. Wilk	Let's hope so.
26521	J.D.'s Narration	Everyone has their own way of getting stuff off their minds.Some like to work it off.Others try to drink it away.For me, I had heard that the piercing girl at the mall was easy.
26522	J.D.	Thanks for penciling me in.
26523	Piercing Girl	Mmhmm.
26524	J.D.	Maybe later, you can show me where else you're pierced.
26525	Piercing Girl	Why wait till later?
26526	J.D.	All right.Ahh! Uhhg! Ahh! Uggh!I feel so close to you right now.HOOOOO!!
26527	Elliot	Why do I always forget that I'm lactose intolerant?
26528	Turk	What are you guys doing down here?
26529	Elliot	Well, we were so bummed about Mrs. Wilk that we inhaled six gallons of ice cream.
26530	Carla	Would you tell Dr. Kelso to make this gym more female friendly?
26531	Elliot	Yeah, there's like no equipment for women down here.
26532	Todd	You know where there's all kinds of equipment for women? Todd-land.
26533	Turk	Dammit, Todd, what did I tell you about talking like that around my wife?
26534	Todd	Wait until she leaves and then say it?
26535	Turk	Exactly! You're welcome.
26536	Janitor	You saving this seat for your ex-wife?
26537	Dr. Cox	No, no. She's uh, she's over there.
26538	Guy	Do you know that guy pointing us?
26539	Jordan	No. You should fight him.
26540	Dr. Cox	One rule. No yapping. The only thing I want to hear is the sound of my liver drunkenly singing rugby songs.
26541	Janitor	Calm down. I'm not even here. Seriously. My shift at the hospital doesn't end for three hours. I hate that place and everyone in it.
26542	Dr. Cox	I'll drink to hate. Cheers.Ha ha ha! You're right. You know what else I hate about Kelso?
26543	Janitor	Hmm.
26544	Dr. Cox	His hair smells like a pet store.
26545	Janitor	Oh, actually, that;s my fault. I filled his hairspray can with dog sweat.
26546	Dr. Cox	Dogs don't sweat.
26547	Janitor	No?
26548	Dr. Cox	No.
26549	Janitor	What the hell am I putting in there?
26550	Jordan	Per, we're giving Bobby a ride home. Say goodnight to your girlfriend, I'm sure he'll be here tomorrow.
26551	Janitor	I will. Not that it matters.
26552	Dr. Cox	Not that I care.
26553	Jordan	Perry! Door closes at midnight! Ugh!
26554	Dr. Cox	Yeah, I gotta go.
26555	Janitor	Yup.
26556	J.D.	I tell you, I am done trying to pick up the random ladies, because every time I do, I end up with a bunch of face holes and an emerald stud in my peep.
26557	J.D.'s Thoughts	Which I'm keeping.
26558	Turk	Dude, you're surrounded by female interns who'd do anything to get with the big, bad attending. Make a booty call.
26559	Carla	He's right, people have been making booty calls since the dawn of time.
26560	Cavewoman	Cronk! Why you go now?
26561	J.D.	Oh, hey, you're up. Umm, look, I don't what you're looking for, but I just got out of a really tough relationship with this girl, Debbie. Also, my sister was carried off by a giant bird, so we've all been in mourning about that, and, um, my brother at my foot. But you were just fantastic. The things you were doing last night, they were, well, crazy. OK? Uh, so when I clear my own stuff up, I'd love to maybe get back together with you.
26562	Cavewoman	Hungry.
26563	J.D.	OK, I should really go.You know what? I'll do it. If my partner in crime here will join me.
26564	Elliot	Ugh, J.D., booty calls are pathetic.
26565	Carla	More pathetic than emailing your high school boyfriend to see if his marriage is holding up, hello?
26566	Turk	Black hand-slap.
26567	Elliot	Uh-huh Carla, Mike Gorski wrote "keep in touch" in my yearbook, and that's all I'm doing, OK? Yes, he did say that his wife, Carol, is his "soulmate," and yes, they also have adorable twins, but he also said that he wishes she knew how to ski, so let's just see if they're still together, come winter. Yes, J.D., I will do this with you.
26568	Turk	Oh, Dr. Kelso.
26569	Dr. Cox	Where, uh, where's your wife going?
26570	Carla	He's gonna go ask Dr. Kelso if he can get some equipment for women in the gym.
26571	Dr. Cox	Oh, that is so nice.
26572	Carla	My baby's learning.
26573	Turk	Oh!
26574	Dr. Cox	Are you crazy? Why would you want your wife in the gym?
26575	Turk	Because, unlike you, I don't hate my wife.
26576	Dr. Cox	Yet. You don't hate your wife yet. But think about it, huh? You go to work, she's there. You go out, she's there. And when you go home, where is she?
26577	Turk	There.
26578	Dr. Cox	Ding! Women are everywhere. Except for the gym. That's why it's such a magical place. Don't ruin that, don't be that guy. Come on, you're so much more than that. I'm begging you.Uh, ma'am, I'm actually saving that for someone.
26579	Lady	Oh, that's not allowed.
26580	Dr. Cox	Fair enough. Say, that's some real nice pants you have on.
26581	Lady	Oh, well thank you. It's 40% off.
26582	Dr. Cox	What do you say you swing by my place and see if we can't get it 100% off?Had to be done.
26583	Janitor	Thanks, chief, I got your next one.
26584	Dr. Cox	Don't mention it.
26585	Janitor	So I'm late because Dorian parked his scooter behind my new van.
26586	Dr. Cox	Ohh.
26587	Janitor	Practically punctured a tire backing over the thing. Kid drives me crazy.
26588	Dr. Cox	Got a new van, huh?
26589	Janitor	Well, you blew up the old one over a bet, remember?
26590	Dr. Cox	Right. Ah, Dorian drives me crazy, too. But, what are you gonna do about it?
26591	Janitor	Stole this from his locker.I come by here a couple times a week and just move stuff around, turn off his alarm, maybe cut off his bangs.
26592	Dr. Cox	Well, you're clearly in need of help, but gosh-darn it, I'm not gonna give it to you. How sound asleep do you think he really is?
26593	Janitor	Well, watch this.
26594	J.D.	What?
26595	Janitor	So what now?
26596	J.D.	WAAH! Naked. Excellent. Who took my emerald?
26597	J.D.'s Narration	After paying the Janitor the unreasonable sum of $90 to move my bed back home......Elliot and I decided to round up out interns to pick out our respective booty calls.Welcome to Fugly-ville.
26598	Elliot	J.D., I really don't want to do this. Can't we just go home and put on our PJ's and watch Grey's Anatomy?
26599	J.D.	Oh, I do love that show. It's like they've been watching our lives and then just put it on TV.
26600	Elliot	Ha! Yeah.
26601	J.D.	Hmm.
26602	J.D.'s Narration	Carla listened at the door while I was helping Turk ask Dr. Kelso for new gym equipment.
26603	Dr. Kelso	What do you want?
26604	J.D.'s Narration	And then, Turk lied.
26605	Turk	Sir, we're here on behalf of Dr. Bianca. You know, the albino radiologist?
26606	Dr. Kelso	Oh, Jim! Who did he get pregnant this time? I tell you, the ladies can not resist that ivory rascal.
26607	Turk	Sir, Jim is demanding that he get new equipment in his lab.
26608	Dr. Kelso	Demanding?There is no way in hell that Jim is getting new equipment!
26609	Turk	Sorry, baby. I tried.
26610	J.D.	Is there any change?
26611	Nurse	She's still the same.
26612	J.D.'s Narration	I guess in the back of my mind, I was hoping for a pleasant surprise. Because around here, most of them are unpleasant. Like when a guy you thought you connected with, suddenly turns on you...
26613	Dr. Cox	Hey, how's the day treating you big, guy?
26614	Janitor	You're not talking to me, are you, Doogie?
26615	Dr. Cox	Doogie?
26616	Janitor	This is a doctor no-fly zone, bubs. Speaking of flies, yours is down.Oh no! He fell for the grade school zinger! You gotta go. Back to the game, boys.
26617	Carla	And you guys would not believe how hard my man fought for us.
26618	Turk	Well, you know, ladies, I do what I do, when I do what I do.
26619	J.D.'s Narration	...Or your boss blows your cover.
26620	Dr. Kelso	Turkleton, I have reconsidered your request, and I decided to give old Jim that new MRI machine.
26621	Turk	Woo. See, no, baby, wait. Aaah!
26622	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, my surprise came the next morning when I found out that Elliot had broken our no booty call agreement with my nemesis
26623	J.D.	Why is he wearing my robe?
26624	Keith	It fits me.
26625	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26626	Elliot	J.D., I can explain.
26627	J.D.	Oh, you did it twice! Somebody's a stud. We got a stud alert in here. Woop! Woop! Woop!OK. This is just mathematically impossible.
26628	Elliot	Keith, Dr. Dorian and I have to go to work now, OK? So why don't you just clean all this up and drop off my laundry and then bring me a cup of coffee to the hospital? Run along, quick like a bunny.
26629	Keith	Sure thing, Elliot.
26630	Elliot	Keith! It's after nine. It's Dr. Reid now.
26631	Keith	Dr. Reid. Dr. Reid.
26632	Elliot	I love booty calls. Ha!
26633	J.D.	"El Toro Grande?" I'm not familiar with this brand.No change. Her FiO2 is still 50%.
26634	Elliot	I said no cream.I didn't say no cream. It's like having a sex puppy. What's your problem?
26635	J.D.	I gotta tell you, I can't stand that guy.
26636	Elliot	J.D., he's just a booty call. Say the word and I'll end it.
26637	J.D.	I'd appreciate it if you did.
26638	Elliot	Oh, my God, you've turned Keith into forbidden fruit. I must have him now!Heel! Kk-kk-kk.
26639	Janitor	Oh, hey, bud. Check out my new mop bling. Bling!It's cool. Cleaned it.
26640	Dr. Cox	Oh, so now we're pals again? I gotta be honest with you, I'm a little confused there, Sasquatch.
26641	Janitor	I got a rep to protect, OK? I'm sort of seen as the king of the working folk. If they catch me hob-nobbing with a doctor-type, well, suffice it to say I won't get my cut of all the prosthetics we looted from the storage room.
26642	Dr. Cox	How's that?
26643	Janitor	We sell the feet to college kids for $500 a pop. Apparently, they smoke something out of them.
26644	Dr. Cox	Let me get this straight. You are embarrassed to be seen with me?
26645	Janitor	At the hospital. At the bar, we can hang out all we want.You rich, yacht-owning punk! You think they're gone. It's cool. See you at the bar.
26646	Jordan	Aww, sweetie. Do you want me to call his mommy and tell her he's being mean to you? My fwiend is mean to me, wah!
26647	Turk	Listen. Honey, I know you're angry. But look what I found in my locker: a wad of cash. Now you can buy those shoes you always wanted.
26648	Carla	I'm not mad about that gym thing. Sign this, please?
26649	Turk	Any of you ladies have a pen?
26650	Carla	Woo!
26651	Turk	Whoa! Yow! YOW!
26652	Carla	Ah.
26653	Turk	You set me up! Baby, you are mad. Look, it's not a crime for me to want to have one place that I can hang out by myself.
26654	Carla	Turk, I am not mad, OK? Now staple these please.
26655	Turk	Anybody got a staplHey! Hey.
26656	J.D.'s Narration	I promised myself I would pick on Keith, but this one he had coming.
26657	J.D	OK, guys, gather round, gather round. Your hero, Keith, here forgot to check the blood levels on Mr. Joy this morning. And guess what? He's dead. Way to go, there, Keith.
26658	Keith	I've never even seen this guy before.
26659	J.D.	Oh, way to get to know your patients, there, murderer.
26660	Doug	There's Mr. Joy. J.D., did you steal him from the morgue?
26661	J.D.	Doug, I left a note on the decapitated guy's stump that I would have him back by two. It is 1:45.
26662	Doug	Now I have to take him back down to the basement and I don't even have my gurney. I hate dead people.
26663	J.D.	All right, the real reason I brought Mr. Joy up here was for a teaching exercise. Can anyone figure out what the cause of death may have been?
26664	Keith	Maybe when you leaned over to check his IV, you smothered him with one of your love handles.
26665	J.D.	What did you say Keith?
26666	Keith	Dr. Reid told me that if you picked on me, I should stand up for myself. And that you're very sensitive about your doughy physique.
26667	J.D.	Well, I'm not.
26668	Doug	Please, no one help. He's not heavy at all.
26669	J.D.	You know, Keith, I think out of professional decorum, we should refrain from talking about Dr. Reid. He's boinking her, everyone. That's why he gets special treatment. What did she say to do if I said that?
26670	Keith	Page her.
26671	Elliot	Hello.
26672	J.D.	Ack. I forgot how strong you are when you're mad.
26673	Dr. Cox	Hey, uh, can I talk to you for a second?
26674	Janitor	What's the matter, Sally? The vending machine is out of bras again?
26675	Worker	Nice, you tell him.
26676	Janitor	What's up, buddy?
26677	Dr. Cox	Well, nothing really, I just thought your friends over there might be interested in seeing this photo of us I took with my cell phone the other night.I'm going to airbrush "friends forever" on it and then I'm going to hang these bad boys all over the hospital.Oh, evocative.
26678	Janitor	Give it to me.
26679	Dr. Cox	You want it? Come and get it. Come on, get it!
26680	Dr. Kelso	Gentlemen, let's try to be professional.
26681	Doug	I left my gurney downstairs in the morgue.
26682	Dr. Kelso	You're a superstar.
26683	Turk	Ain't nobody in this state gonna kill me, woman.
26684	Carla	Well, you know what bothers me? You whining about me being in your space when you're the one who never wants to be alone. I mean for God's sake...
26685	J.D.	Doughy physique, Elliot? Doughy physique?
26686	Elliot	Well, if the pear-shaped shirt fits, wear it!
26687	J.D.	I am ashamed of you, OK, do you know petty it is to get that personal?Once, when we were dating, Elliot asked me to urinate on her.
26688	Elliot	Dammit, I had been stung by a jellyfish!
26689	J.D.'s Narration	Around here it can feel like good things never happen.
26690	Dr. Cox	Good to see you, you old bird.
26691	Mrs. Wilk	did I miss anything?
26692	J.D.	I'll catch you up later.
26693	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, when they do, all the petty little arguments fade away.And you don't mind waiting a little longer for your workout......Or your bar friend not being your work friend.Because the truth is, when you put stuff into perspective, the little things will never bother you again.
26694	Keith	Good morning, Dr. D. Dr. Reid told me to get my sweet ass out of the shower and make her an omelet. You want one?
26695	J.D.'s Thoughts	Did I say never?
26696	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26697	J.D.'s Narration	The worst thing about Elliot having picked my annoying intern, Keith, as her permanent booty call is that if he's had a few beers, he sometimes forgets which room is hers.
26698	Keith	I'm here, lover.
26699	J.D.	Tender.In my defense, Keith's a decent kisser and anyone waking up that way would let out a pleasure moan.
26700	Turk	Same thing happened to me in college.
26701	J.D.	Really? What guy drunkenly kissed you while you were sleeping?
26702	J.D.'s Narration	And it was at that moment that Turk and I remembered the incident we managed to block out for 12 years.
26703	Turk	Uh, you OK with us not hanging out for a couple of weeks?
26704	J.D.	Totally.
26705	Turk	OK.
26706	J.D.'s Narration	I was going to miss Turk but luckily, my favorite intern was around to cheer me up: Jason Cabbagio. Or as I had brilliantly nicknamed him...
26707	J.D.	Cabbage!
26708	Jason & Mark	Yes, sir?
26709	J.D.	Oh, no Mark, I wasn't talking to you. I was talking to Cabbage.
26710	Mark	Well, my last name is Cabbage.
26711	J.D.	I know that, but I've nicknamed you "Wolfman" because of your keen sense of smell.
26712	J.D.'s Thoughts	And your ridiculously hairy torso.
26713	J.D.	Now, what can I do you for?
26714	Jason	Dr. D, is the IV supposed to leak like this?
26715	J.D.	Well, yes and no, mostly no, really - really, all no. But don't worry, I got your back. First thing is, take a little nipper yourself.Oh, got some on you, look out! OK, that's some of the fun that you can have, but no , seriously watch and learn, watch and learn.
26716	Jason	It's an honor to watch you work, sir.
26717	J.D.	Take it all in, Cabbage, take it all in.
26718	J.D.'s Narration	Yes, I like some interns more than others, but I never let my personal feelings affect my professional behavior.
26719	J.D.	You're late, Keith! Which doesn't surprise me because you're a bad person.
26720	Keith	Sir, they needed help with a shooting victim downstairs.
26721	J.D.	Lies will get you nowhere, Keith.
26722	Keith	I'm covered in his blood.
26723	J.D.	That could be anyone's blood.
26724	Carla	Here's the gunshot victim from downstairs.
26725	Gunshot Victim	Hey, look! My blood.
26726	J.D.	That's not your blood.
26727	Gunshot Victim	Yes it is.
26728	J.D.	Quiet time.
26729	Turk	All right, listen. If Mr. Burton wants the surgery, you just call me on my celly.
26730	Elliot	Cool, what's your number?
26731	Turk	You have my number.
26732	Elliot	I don't, I changed phones.
26733	Turk	Oh. But you didn't switch out the old numbers into the new phone?
26734	Elliot	Yeah, but I decided just to put a couple of emergency numbers on here...
26735	Turk	"The Butterball Turkey help line." This one just says "That guy in the restaurant."
26736	Elliot	Hey, I really clicked with "that guy in the restaurant," OK? We spent all night talking about...something, OK? Look, Turk, if I need you I can just call Carla. It's not like we hang out just the two of us anymore. I bet you don't have my number in your cell.
26737	J.D.'s Narration	Not even Keith could bum me out because everyone's favorite patient, Mrs. Wilk, is going going home today.
26738	Mrs. Wilk	I'm sure not going to miss this food.
26739	Carla	Well, the nurses and I got you this.Huh?
26740	Mrs. Wilk	Ohh!
26741	Carla	You should see the size of the stationery store.
26742	J.D.'s Narration	That was a huge courtesy laugh, because I was about to trump Carla's goodbye gift like nobody's business.
26743	J.D.	Mrs. Wilk, I remembered how much you like basketball, so I got you a DVD of the NBA's "All Time Greatest Centers of All Time" signed by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
26744	Mrs. Wilk	Oh, J.D., this is so sweet.
26745	J.D.'s Thoughts	Winner!
26746	Keith	My gift is in the same vein.
26747	J.D.	Oh, is it, Keith?
26748	Keith	Mr. Abdul-Jabbar is on my dad's flag football team.
26749	Kareem Abdul-Jabbar	Hi, Patricia.
26750	Mrs. Wilk	Oh!
26751	Kareem Abdul-Jabbar	That's not my signature. Did you sign this? It's illegal.
26752	J.D.	OK. Back to the psych ward, Mr. Rosenberg. Crazy.
26753	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26754	J.D.'s Narration	That morning seemed like any other. Dr. Mickhead was back, having beaten the rap on murdering his spouse.
26755	Dr. Mickhead	Anyone want a cool prison jumpsuit?
26756	J.D.'s Narration	Dr. Kelso was having his daily staring contest with the last double chocolate chocolate-chip muffin.
26757	Dr. Kelso	Let's end this charade. You win again. You always do.Would someone explain what that bird is doing in my hospital?
26758	Janitor	Sanchez appears to be flying, sir. I've named him Sanchez. He set up shop in that old wreath, there. I'd take it down, but the patients around here really seem to love the little guy.
26759	Dr. Kelso	That disease-infested scavenger is a serious health risk!
26760	Janitor	Oh.
26761	Dr. Kelso	do you know the number one cause of death in the hospital?
26762	Dr. Cox	Your breath?
26763	Dr. Kelso	Infection. And do you know how quickly infection spreads in a hospital?
26764	Dr. Cox	Your breath.
26765	Dr. Kelso	That doesn't make sense.
26766	Dr. Cox	Hmm. Don't care.
26767	Dr. Kelso	Look. Infection can start with a simple sneeze......and then a handshake......perhaps an accidental collision......then a simple touch on the shoulder.And just like that, you have a patient in trouble.
26768	Todd	Chinatown is awesome.
26769	Dr. Kelso	I want that bird gone.
26770	J.D.	Keith, I realize you'd like to be at your grandmother's funeral on Saturday, heck, we all would. But you can't just take a day off whenever you feel like it.
26771	Keith	Then how come Cabbage got Saturday off so he could go see King Kong?
26772	J.D.	Because, Keith, Cabbage is an ape enthusiast. Show him a little.It's like I'm at the zoo. Put the thing in your mouth, when you...Yeah!
26773	Turk	See you, Mrs. Wilk.
26774	Mrs. Wilk	I'm gonna miss you.
26775	Elliot	I'm going to miss our late night talks.
26776	Mrs. Wilk	You can call me any time you want, sweetie.
26777	Elliot	Got you number right here on my phone. Sorry.
26778	Turk	Don't even worry about it. It's OK.We are so not cool.
26779	Elliot	We're not? Why are you making such a big deal out of this? It was a simple...
26780	Turk	LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA...
26781	Turk & Elliot	Mr. Burton, hey!
26782	Elliot	Now, in a few minutes, I'm be coming get you for your aortic bi-fem bypass surgery.
26783	Turk	And if there's anything we can do for you, just let us know.
26784	Mr. Burton	Well, if I don't make it, I want you to make sure my sons gets this note.
26785	Turk & Elliot	Done.
26786	Janitor	Oh-ho-ho, I can't believe you fell for that. Why would that call have been for you? It's my cell phone. Do you have my one button?Hey! Now I can't call my buddies in Saigon. Touché. What else can you do?
26787	J.D.	Hey, can I borrow five bucks? I left my wallet at home.
26788	Dr. Cox	Whaddaya need five dollars for, because Abraham
26789	Carla	Because Abraham Lincoln is your latest president crush, or because Woolworth is having a 48 hour girdle sale? There, I did for you, don't talk with your mouthful.Here, all I have are hundreds.Because I worked the streets last night, apparently I'm a prostitute.
26790	Dr. Cox	OK!
26791	Carla	Thanks.
26792	J.D.	Thank you.
26793	Janitor	Nice job, buddy. Let's go get you that hat.Mine.
26794	Carla	Where's my change?
26795	J.D.	A bird took it.
26796	Carla	I want it back by tonight, or I'm going to beat it out of you.
26797	Dr. Cox	Why are you sitting here, Newbie?
26798	J.D.	I'd sit with my interns, but Keith's over there and I can't stand him.
26799	Dr. Cox	I've seen that kid. Horrible doctor. I would sooner leave my medical care in the hands of Dr. Acula. Yes, I read your screenplay and as much as it pains me to say it, I didn't hate it. All right, lookit, here's what you gotta do with this Keith. You turn the heat up on his ass, and sooner or later he'll make a mistake and then you bounce him the hell out of here.
26800	J.D.	What did you think of the Transylvania dream sequence? Because I wrote it while I was on call, and the next morning I woke up and read it and I was like "what was I thinking," you know?
26801	Dr. Cox	Bethany. Focus.
26802	J.D.	Well, I can't just pick one of them out to torture.
26803	Dr. Cox	Then dump on all of them. I'm sure they deserve it, I mean let's face the facts. You are their teacher, how competent can they be?
26804	J.D.	Actually, just this morning, one of them had trouble with an IV. Yesterday, one of them made a diagnosis off a backwards X-ray, and last week one of them make a patient septic when he confused a suppository with a Mike & Ike.
26805	Dr. Cox	Stellar group there, Newbie, let the torturing commence.Oh, I'm sorry, that means conversational time is o-v-e-r. Please exit the area. Please exit the area. Please exit the area.
26806	J.D.	When you get a chance, I'd love to talk to you more about the screenplay.
26807	Dr. Cox	Please exit the area. Please exit the area. Please exit the area.
26808	J.D.'s Narration	Turk and Elliot were having a hard time, too, because their patient, Mr. Burton, didn't make it through surgery.
26809	Turk	We did everything we could for your dad.
26810	Elliot	We are so sorry, Devin, Eric.
26811	Eric	That's Devin, I'm Eric.
26812	Elliot	Oh. You guys must get that all the time.
26813	Devin	Why, because all black people look the same?
26814	Elliot	God, no, because you're identical twins.
26815	Devin	Is she always this racist?
26816	Turk	Oh, there's a pattern.
26817	Elliot	Identical twins, Turk!
26818	J.D.	Uh- oh, Keith. It looks like someone's gone prematurely gray. That's gonna hurt with the ladies.
26819	Carla	Wow. You know, Dr. Cox told me you were getting tough on your interns. I had no idea you were gonna go all cotton ball on their asses.
26820	J.D.	I think I know how to deal with people, Carla. Check this. Cabbage, heat test!
26821	Jason	It's a little hot.
26822	J.D.	I'll add some milk. Thank you. See?
26823	Carla	Yeah.
26824	J.D.'s Thoughts	And now, it's goodbye, Keith.
26825	J.D.	Interns, gather! The next intern who screws up is going to be suspended for two weeks! This is a list of all of your names. At least the ones I remember. At the end of each day, I will either write a smiley face or a sad face next to your name. One sad face and you are gonzo, and I want to warn you, I write my sad faces pretty darn sad. Allow me to demonstrate. Dr. Cox, may I borrow your pen?
26826	Dr. Cox	Not going to happen. I had to strangle a nurse to get this clicky-top.
26827	J.D.	Please? I'm in the middle of a very threatening speech.
26828	Dr. Cox	Return this pen or die painfully.
26829	J.D.	Thank you. So as I was saying, my sad faces...
26830	J.D.'s Narration	Around here, it can be pretty tough to hang onto things. So if someone's trying to take your new friend away, you might have to lie.
26831	Janitor	The bird's dead, sir. And if you're wondering, Sanchez tasted like chicken. I ate him.
26832	Dr. Kelso	I get it. Now would you sign this order form so I can stop talking to you?
26833	Janitor	Gracias.
26834	Dr. Kelso	De nada.
26835	Eric	You said our father left us a note?
26836	Elliot	Yeah. Dr. Turk, give it to them.
26837	Turk	Elliot, I gave it to you, you have the note, you give it to them.
26838	J.D.'s Narration	And if you feel your credibility slipping, you might have to excuse yourself for a moment.
26839	Elliot	Excuse us for one minute, there, Devin, Eric, um. Hmm..
26840	J.D.	Anyway, I know it's in pencil, but that's what a sad, two-week suspension face would look like, all right? Very, very sad. Yes?Who tried to give Mrs. Meadows an ACE inhibitor? She's six months pregnant, she could have lost the baby.
26841	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, sometimes there's nothing you can do.
26842	Jason	That was me, sir. Sorry.
26843	J.D.	Oh, Cabbage. Not you, Wolfman. Ugh.
26844	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26845	Dr. Cox	I uh, I can't believe you're finally getting out of this deathtrap. I mean the odds were against you. You had a life threatening disease, life threatening doctor...Anyway, it was a pleasure treating you, and...
26846	Mrs. Wilk	I know how hard it is for you to say something nice, so you can go.
26847	Dr. Cox	Thanks.Why the grim face, there, Trish? Watching Dr. Kelso's afternoon staring contest with the last brownie?
26848	Dr. Kelso	You bested me again, you little chocolate bitch.
26849	J.D.	Nah, I'm just kind of sad about my intern.
26850	Dr. Cox	Why? You got what you wanted, you drove Keith out of here.
26851	J.D.	No, I drove Cabbage out. That's Keith.
26852	Dr. Cox	That's Keith? That kid's the best intern we've got. Hell, I'd like to bronze him and turn my office into a Keith-edral and convert to Keith-stianity. F.Y.I., I still want my pen back.
26853	J.D.	Oh, I don't have it.
26854	Dr. Cox	You damn sure better find it, Newbie, and when you do, I want it buffed, shined and de-nerdified.You think that's funny? This isn't over.
26855	J.D.	What's not over?Do you know what's not over?
26856	Elliot	You are making such a big deal about this. Turk, I did not lose it, you did.
26857	Turk	I don't lose things.
26858	Carla	Please, you lose everything. Sometimes I worry what you'll be like as a dad.
26859	Turk	Yeah, baby, we're on our way back now. Junior and I just went to go pick up a pumpkin.I'm gonna have to call you back.
26860	Woman	Look, somebody left a baby here.
26861	Carla	Well, he is kind of cute.
26862	Turk	Phew.Our baby's first bath.
26863	Carla	Oh, watch the head.What?!
26864	Turk	OHHHHHHH!
26865	Carla	Come on, that was intentional!
26866	Turk	Charge the mound, son!
26867	Turk & Carla	Charge the mound!
26868	Turk	We're so damn proud of you, son.
26869	Carla	That's my little valedictorian.
26870	Turk	Ha ha.
26871	Carla	No!
26872	Turk	Put him back together, baby!
26873	Carla	No!!
26874	Son	Mom? Dad?!
26875	Carla	Son? Son?
26876	Turk	Get over here, boy! You come over here and give your father a hug!NOOOOOO!!!!Dude, you all right? You were gone for a really long time.
26877	J.D.	You're gonna be an awful father!
26878	J.D.'s Thoughts	And now, to take care of my boy.
26879	J.D.	Cabbage is back! Gang, I should have made it clear, earlier. The suspension policy begins today at 4PM. So, my apologies to Cabbage.
26880	Jason	That's OK, Dr. D.
26881	J.D.	You get in there!
26882	Keith	This is totally unfair! If I had messed up, I'd be gone.
26883	J.D.	Let me explain something to you, Keith, OK? I treat each and every one of you like unique individuals, OK? Take Gloria, for example, she's 400 years old. She needs to sleep a lot. I work around that schedule.Wolfman has gotta be home by daybeak, so he does all of his work come nightfall. Crazy Barry. Not allowed near children. We work around that.
26884	Keith	How come I don't get a nickname?
26885	J.D.	Not everyone's last name lends itself to a nickname, Keith.
26886	Keith	My last name is Dudemeister.
26887	J.D.	And what am I supposed to do with that? OK, I'm not a magician.
26888	Dr. Kelso	Patricia, it's been a real pleasure having you at Sacred Heart. And I certainly hope the next time you fall ill, you'll remember us. I'm...not implying that you'll get ill, it's just that you're old and chances are good stop talking, Robert.
26889	Mrs. Wilk	It's all right, I knew what you meant.
26890	Janitor	Dammit, Sanchez, I told you, Dorian's in room 136. This is...
26891	Dr. Cox	Hey, Newbie!Watch out for the bedpan. Now we're even. But answer me this one question, will you please?
26892	J.D.	Those are beautiful antlers.
26893	Dr. Cox	Ruh? Why is that screw-up still here?
26894	J.D.	You see, Dr. Cox, I treat each and every one of my interns differenly...
26895	Dr. Cox	And, you're done. So, you accidentally drummed your friend out of here because you were trying to eighty-six the Dudemeister, eh?
26896	J.D.	that nickname will never stick. It's too long.
26897	Dr. Cox	Listen carefully, Newbie. Things happen for a reason. Do me a favor and think back on all those mistakes your interns made and tell me this: who made them?
26898	Jason	Hey. Dr. D, is the IV supposed to leak like this?I'm not quite sure what I'm looking at here.Don't worry. You're going to feel much better after I insert this suppository.
26899	J.D.	I don't remember who made those mistakes.
26900	Dr. Cox	Yeah, you do.
26901	J.D.'s Thoughts	OK, this sucks. But at least I didn't forge a note from a dead father.
26902	Turk	Are you guys ready? All right, Elliot, begin.
26903	Elliot	My dearest Eric, it is my wish for you that you finally find a good woman...
26904	Eric	I'm gay.
26905	Elliot	...so that she might find you a man...
26906	Eric	Dad didn't know I was gay.
26907	Elliot	...so that he might find you a woman.
26908	Janitor	I found your note inside Sanchez's wreath. I also found a bunch of little furniture. I don't know where he got that, he sure as hell didn't make it. He didn't have the time.
26909	Devin	Make sure you clean out the gutters at the lake house so the porch doesn't flood?
26910	Turk	Ours is better than that.
26911	Janitor	Well, it's done. I had him stuffed.
26912	Dr. Kelso	Terrific.
26913	Janitor	And, he's gone. Wow, that was impressive, my friend. You're free to fly.Farewell, Sanchez. Tienes mi corazón! Tienes mi corazón.
26914	J.D.'s Thoughts	Time to give Keith, here, a little treat.
26915	J.D.	Hey, Todd. My buddy, Keith, here, says you're no good at rat-tailing.
26916	Todd	Oh, really?
26917	J.D.	Oh!
26918	Todd	Yeah! There! Tell him I'm good!
26919	J.D.	Oh, he's good, Keith. Really good.
26920	Keith	Thanks for the warning.
26921	Jason	Hey, Dr. Dorian.
26922	J.D.	Hey, Jason, uh, we need to talk. Look, you're you're not progressing as fast as the other interns, and you've been making a lot of mistakes lately.
26923	Jason	I know what you're going to say. I really am suspended for two weeks. But I promise, I'll do much better when I come back.
26924	J.D.	Yeah, about coming back...
26925	J.D.'s Narration	Dr. Cox was right. Things do happen for a reason.Like how going through a horrible experience with a friend can remind you how much you missed hanging out together.
26926	Turk	"A woman, to find a man, to find a woman."
26927	Elliot	Excuse me for a sec.
26928	Turk	"Incoming call from Elliot Reid?"
26929	Elliot	You're on speed dial, baby.
26930	Turk	Ah!Wazzup?
26931	Elliot	Wazzup?
26932	Turk	What you doin'?
26933	J.D.'s Narration	And in Cabbage's case, as much as I was gonna miss him, I was just lucky to get rid of him before he rally hurt someone.
26934	Jason	You've always been really nice to me and I just wanted to say thanks. And, goodbye.
26935	Mrs. Wilk	Oh, goodbye, young man.
26936	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26937	J.D.'s Narration	Lately, Elliot and her booty call, Keith, loved playing games. Tonight it was the orchard owner and the Mexican apple thief.
26938	Elliot	Confess, Manuel! Confess that you stole these apples.
26939	Keith	I was at the dance, with the other pickers.
26940	Elliot	Liar!
26941	J.D.'s Narration	Frankly, the whole thing disgusted me.
26942	Elliot	You saw him do it, didn't you, Paco?
26943	J.D.'s Narration	Mostly, because they never let me speak.
26944	J.D.	He hid them in his pantalones. He loves these apples. He makes apples pie, and apples juice with them.
26945	Elliot	Paco, you can't talk because you lost your tongue in that cider press accident last year, remember? Now back to the pickers' bunkhouse!
26946	J.D.	I hate the pickers' bunkhouse.
26947	J.D.'s Narration	And I hate Keith. Which begs the question: why do I insist on being a part of their foreplay?I guess I needed a distraction because last week we all thought Mrs. Wilk was going home, but she got an infection. Despite our best efforts, she was now going to die. To make her happy, we decided to take her to the beach.
26948	Mrs. Wilk	I'm going to miss the feel of sand between my toes.
26949	J.D.'s Narration	Still, she was sick, so we couldn't go far.
26950	J.D.	Want me to bury you?
26951	Dr. Cox	Aw, shut up and move the Sunbrella, will you? I'm freckling.
26952	J.D.	I thought we had more sand.)
26953	Ted	Now what?
26954	Radio Announcer	OK, people, it's for our $50,000 cash draw. Today's lucky listener: Ted Buckland!
26955	Ted	What?
26956	Dr. Cox	Would you love a virgin daiquiri? It's a normal daiquiri, I just let him give it to you.
26957	Mrs. Wilk	Thanks! Cheers. You know, I've never really been afraid of death. I used it as a motivator. When you know there's an end, it forces you to live. It forced me in the eighth grade to ask Peter Bucharelli to take me to the sock hop. It made me dare to travel the world. It made me who I am. Still, now that I'm actually staring it in the eye, I why am I so scared?
26958	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes life sucks.
26959	Radio Announcer	Sorry, Ted, apparently you don't need the money!
26960	Ted	NOOOOOOO! Why?
26961	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26962	J.D.'s Narration	Mrs. Wilk decided to call the hospital grief counselor. He had a certain frankness about death.
26963	Dr. Hedrick	So, which one of you is gonna kick it? No, don't tell me, I want to guess. Uhh, I'm thinking it's either you, or you. No, you, because you're hooked up to a bunch of machines, or you, well you just have that look of someone who's gonna die young. I'm kidding!
26964	J.D.	Oh.
26965	Dr. Hedrick	You're gonna live forever. Or not, I mean, what do I know, I'm not psychic.
26966	J.D.'s Narration	We did not like him.
26967	Mrs. Wilk	I think he's funny.
26968	Dr. Cox	She's delirious.
26969	Dr. Hedrick	Mrs. Wilk, I'm Dr. Hedrick. Now it sounds cliché, but you're going to go through what we call the five stages of grief, which are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and finally acceptance. Now, I assume that you two have already entered a conversation with Mrs. Wilk about what the process of dying is going to be like.
26970	Dr. Cox	We were doing it, right before you came in.
26971	Dr. Hedrick	Oh, well then I'm sorry, please continue.
26972	Dr. Cox	All right, we will. Newbie, go.
26973	J.D.	Oh, oh, uh, OK, yeah, um...OK, death is like a journey. Uh, a journey in a boat, and uh, then this giant light shines down on, on your "boat," and um, um, it carries you up to the heavens.
26974	Dr. Hedrick	That was the ending to Cocoon.
26975	J.D.	Take it away, Coxy.
26976	Elliot	Keith, keep moving, no talking. Hey, where's my wave, you little piece of meat?
26977	Carla	You know, Elliot, the four of us should go out to dinner.
26978	Turk	Honey, why are you so obsessed about going out with other couples? Didn't you learn your lesson last with our neighbors?
26979	Carla	Squirrel chili. Who knew? It's really good.
26980	Turk	I want to go home.
26981	Carla	Eat your soup.
26982	Turk	No.They're not even our neighbors. They live in the woods behind our apartment.
26983	Carla	And we would have been having brunch with them on Sunday if you could have choked down the tail.
26984	Elliot	Carla, I don't know about dinner, Keith is a booty call. I actually make it a point not to see him before midnight.
26985	Ted	Oh, good. The piles are getting smaller.
26986	Janitor	Good.
26987	Dr. Kelso	Oh, that reminds me, did you get that damn sand out of his office?
26988	Janitor	Yes, I did, and it cut my commute in half.Good morning, loyal subjects! Enjoy your day in Janitoria! Labor until you tire! And then labor some more! Looks like rain. That could be a problem.
26989	Ted	Sir, can I have Sunday afternoon off?
26990	Dr. Kelso	Well, that depends. Is Baxter's dog run going to hose itself down?
26991	Ted	No...
26992	Dr. Kelso	Actually, it is, I rigged the hose to a timer. But I need you to clean out my gutters.
26993	Ted	But, sir, I'm doing a bike ride for charity.
26994	Dr. Kelso	Ted, the only thing I hate more than bikes are procedural cop shows. We get it. The pedophile did it. Be at my house at 2:30.
26995	Ted	Just once I I wish I could treat Dr. Kelso like he treats us.
26996	Janitor	With Kelso, you got no leverage.
26997	Ted	Leverage. Leverage?
26998	Janitor	You don't know what it means, do you?
26999	Ted	No...
27000	Dr. Hedrick	I understand you guys spend most of your time fighting death around here, so it's it's understandable that you're made uncomfortable by this. Now, if you'd like, I'm willing to counsel both of you.
27001	J.D.'s Narration	I was tempted to take him up on it, but then Dr. Cox said something.
27002	Dr. Cox	Listen up. We don't need any of your head-shrinking.
27003	J.D.'s Thoughts	"We?" He said "we." After all these years, he's finally made us a team!
27004	J.D.	Yeah, Hedrick! If it was up to us, we never even would have called you! We can handle death just fine! We might even be going into private practice together.
27005	Dr. Cox	What?
27006	J.D.'s Thoughts	Easy. Now is not the time to discuss the Dorian-Cox clinic, Much less the relocation to Jacksonville.
27007	Dr. Hedrick	Clearly, I'm pushing some buttons here.
27008	Dr. Cox	You couldn't push my buttons if you tried. In fact, I have no buttons. Please think of me as buttonless. All smooth, like GI-Joe's nether-regions, and by-the-by, this image is brought to you by my son, Jack, who has been yanking the pants off his toy soldiers and leaving them in provocative positions on my nightstand. It is just disturbing enough so that leaving the house, I'm cranky and less able to suffer fools. Which brings me back to you: the fool. I'm done suffering you, so go now. Go, go before you can write a book entitled "Help, A Large Doctor Is Beating My Ass: The Lester Hedrick Story."
27009	Dr. Hedrick	That was a mouthful. Anyway, if you need to talk, just give me a call.
27010	Dr. Cox	He seems strangely impervious to my threats. That annoys me.
27011	Carla	So basically, whenever you're in the mood, you just call Keith and he comes over and gives you some of that twenty-something nasty?
27012	Elliot	Watch me.Got the machine. Keith, we're going to your place tonight because my room smells like apple vinegar, so put some clean sheets on the futon and turn all the pictures of your parents face down. Except for that one one of your dad in the Navy...helps me.
27013	Turk	How the hell does he put up with that crap?
27014	Carla	Turk, would you get my scarf out of the car please?
27015	Turk	I am making a point here, honey. No man should
27016	Carla	Turk, less point-making, more scarf-getting.
27017	Turk	'Sup, man, you need a ride?
27018	J.D.	Keep moving, C-Bear.
27019	J.D.'s Thoughts	I was hunting for bigger game.
27020	Dr. Cox	Hey. I thought you went home already.
27021	J.D.	Oh, I tried to, Perry, but I'm having some scooter trouble.
27022	Dr. Cox	Come on, I'll give you a ride. Let's go.Can you believe the huevos on that Hedrick? Holy cow, it's like we've never had a patient die on us before. Uh, I gotta put this bag in the trunk.
27023	J.D.'s Thoughts	I was in the Porsche. I had never made it into the Porsche. It smelled like German heaven. I wasn't gonna blow this opportunity. I had to be careful about every little
27024	J.D.	Hey, a root beer!
27025	Dr. Cox	Don't open that soda. It's been rolling around on the floor for months, it will explode.
27026	J.D.	Apparently you're not familiar with the John Dorian three tap method. Three taps and the foam goes bye-bye.Works every time.Oh. Ahhh! The quickest way to my house is to take Elm.
27027	Keith	Elliot, wait.
27028	Elliot	Oh, I'm sorry, am I looking at your dad too much? His eyes penetrate my soul.
27029	Keith	No. I just want to tell you how beautiful you look right now.
27030	Elliot	That is so sweet.
27031	Janitor	There's something I learned today. Wet sand plus dehumidifier equals cave in.
27032	Dr. Kelso	Is that Ted and bunch of damn bikers?
27033	Janitor	Why do you hate bikes so much, sir?
27034	Dr. Kelso's father	Son, Daddy's got to move on. And I just want you to know that since the car is in your mother's name, I wouldn't be able to leave the family forever if it weren't for your bike.
27035	Dr. Kelso	It's complicated. GET OFF THE ROAD!
27036	Ted	Not today, Bobby! Not today.
27037	Dr. Cox	Ohhh...
27038	Dr. Hedrick	I see we're growling at other human beings now.
27039	J.D.	How you feeling Mrs. Wilk?
27040	Mrs. Wilk	Oh, not great. I'm cold.
27041	Dr. Hedrick	She's been getting weaker.
27042	J.D.'s Narration	In a hospital, you spend most of your time just trying to hold on.Whether it's trying to hold on to your perception of a relationship...
27043	Elliot	Hey, that was fun last night, I'm glad you got my message.
27044	Keith	I didn't get any message.
27045	Elliot	Oh.
27046	Carla	Elliot, if he didn't get your message, that means he called you for sex and you went over and gave it to him!
27047	Turk	You're his booty call now.
27048	J.D.'s Narration	...or just trying to hold on the handlebars of your custom bicycle.
27049	Ted	Don't worry, Teddy, he'll turn.
27050	Dr. Kelso	Why'd you leave me Daddy?
27051	Janitor	Now we got leverage.
27052	J.D.'s Narration	Unfortunately, as a doctor you see your fair share of people who simply can't hold on any longer.
27053	J.D.	She's in multi-organ system dysfunction.
27054	Dr. Hedrick	She's OK. She's ready.
27055	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
27056	J.D.'s Narration	Mrs. Wilk didn't have much time, so either Dr. Cox or I had to notify her next of kin. As physicians, we knew just how to do it.First one to drop tells her.
27057	Dr. Cox	Phew. Pretty strong there, newbie.
27058	J.D.'s Narration	I was not. But hopefully, the duct tape I used to connect my prosthetic arms was.
27059	J.D.	Ow.
27060	Dr. Cox	Oh, why are we still doing this, I've seen people in Mrs. Wilk's shape turn it around, right?
27061	J.D.	She could totally turn it around!
27062	Dr. Hedrick	Denial. Yeah, it's not uncommon for people close to the patient to also undergo the five stages of grief.
27063	Dr. Cox	It's not denial. She could rally.
27064	J.D.	Yeah, totally rally.
27065	Dr. Hedrick	Oh yeah. I mean, look at her, she could be in a vitamin commercial.
27066	Dr. Cox	How would you like to be in a broken jaw commercial?
27067	Dr. Hedrick	God help me. I don't care if it does kill me, I just love this fake sugar.
27068	Dr. Cox	If he keeps ignoring my threats I I'm gonna have to hit him.
27069	J.D.	The good news is it looks like he has a soft face.
27070	Patient	Are you done with my arms?
27071	J.D.	Coming to you, Mr. Johnson.
27072	Elliot	So? I was Keith's booty call last night. Whatever, it'll blow over.
27073	Carla	That's not good enough, Elliot! By letting Keith get the upper hand you've given Turk ideas. Look at him.
27074	Turk	Baby. I know you hate my cool walking stick, but I gotta be my own man. It's catching on!Yeah.
27075	Janitor	OK, Teddy. I got this baby flowing now. I dunno if that's good. You should sue Kelso. You have a serious tort on your hands.
27076	Ted	Tort?
27077	Janitor	Civil case. From the French avoir tort?
27078	Ted	Did you go to law school?
27079	Janitor	No, I was Ruth Bader Ginsberg's janitor for a while.
27080	Ted	Ruth Bader who?
27081	Dr. Kelso	Hey, there's my guy! I just came up to apologize for that little fender bender out there. So, would two floor seats to the WNBA All-Star game just make all of this go away, huh?
27082	Ted	Absolutely!
27083	Janitor	Uh, Ted is going to be wanting a little bit more than that, I'm afraid.
27084	Ted	I am?I am!
27085	J.D.'s Narration	Dr. Cox and I decided to give Hedrick a piece of our mind. Unfortunately, I had lost front seat privileges.
27086	J.D.	Yeah, you're right. Still a little sticky. Not yet ready for passengers.
27087	Dr. Cox	All right, Lester! We are having this out, right here, right now!Oh, for the love of God. What is this, some pansy, get-in-touch-with-my-feelings-because-my-mommy-didn't-love-me group?
27088	J.D.	Yeah, is that what it is?
27089	Dr. Hedrick	Actually, this is a support group for the terminally ill.
27090	J.D.	Oh, we should probably go.
27091	Dr. Hedrick	No, no, please continue.
27092	Dr. Cox	Stop bugging us. I find your particular brand of psycho-babblery about as useful as fairy dust.
27093	Patient	He's actually helped me quite a lot.
27094	Dr. Cox	Oh. Good.
27095	J.D.	Dr. Cox.
27096	Dr. Cox	Yeah, Newbie, what do you got?
27097	J.D.	That guy looks fantastic. What do you think he's dying of, a case of the handsomes?
27098	Dr. Cox	Ah, you know what, to hell with you, Hedrick!
27099	Dr. Hedrick	Group, can you tell me what stage of grief Dr. Cos is going through?
27100	Group	Anger.
27101	Dr. Hedrick	Anger, yes.
27102	Dr. Cox	YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE ME ANGRY!
27103	J.D.	Nor do you want to see I angry.You better hope you don't make any mistakes.It's awful.
27104	Dr. Cox	Uhng.
27105	Turk	All right, Carla's down there telling Elliot to ignore you so she can regain the power.
27106	Keith	Well, I don't really care.
27107	Turk	Well, you know, this isn't about you Keith. This is about men everywhere who've been abused and bullied by women! It's about me. Now when they walk by, you call her a different name.
27108	Keith	I won't do it.
27109	Carla	OK, here's how you get your power back from Keith. Totally ignore him.
27110	Elliot	Really?
27111	Carla	Yep.
27112	Turk	Hey, how you doing, Clare?
27113	Elliot	Did you did you just call me Clare?
27114	Keith	No, I would never call you
27115	Carla	Oh, snap!
27116	Keith	Elliot! That didn't even sound like me.
27117	Turk	I know, they hear what they want to hear. They hear what they want to hear.
27118	Dr. Cox	I tell you what. I'd do anything if it meant she'd pull through this.
27119	J.D.	Me too.
27120	Dr. Hedrick	Hey, that sounds like bargaining. That's the third stage. Oh, and by the way, I wasn't just hiding down there just so I could pop up and say that. I was I was plugging in my iPod. Oh, um.
27121	Dr. Cox	Ehh.
27122	J.D.'s Narration	We weren't the only ones at the bargaining stage.
27123	Dr. Kelso	Heh, heh, heh.
27124	Ted	Ohhhh!Ohhhhhh!!
27125	Dr. Kelso	Now, let's talk, Ted. Just you and me. No lawyers.
27126	Carla	OK. I know how you can regain control of Keith.
27127	Elliot	Carla, don't bother. That booty call thing was fun for a while, but I'm so sick and tired of being a cold, emotionless bastard.
27128	Dr. Cox	Don't ever get sick and tired of that, it is awesome being that.
27129	J.D.	We love it.
27130	Dr. Cox	No!
27131	J.D.	It's too much, I know.
27132	Carla	Well, you can always get another boy toy, right? Plus, every time you look at Keith you're gonna be reminded of all that no-strings-attached fun you had.
27133	Elliot	That's not what I'll remember.
27134	Keith	I just want to tell you how beautiful you look right now.
27135	Elliot	That is so sweet.
27136	Carla	Oh, Elliot! You like him!
27137	J.D.'s Narration	And that was the moment it got real for Elliot.And for Dr. Cox and me.
27138	Dr. Cox	Should be any minute now.
27139	J.D.'s Narration	We'd been there before when someone died. But this felt different.
27140	J.D.	She's gone.
27141	J.D.'s Narration	We were definitely in the depression stage. And bless Hedrick, he didn't say it. All he said was...
27142	Dr. Hedrick	She was lucky to have you two as doctors.
27143	J.D.'s Narration	Letting go is never easy.Whether it's letting go of the leverage you had over your boss...
27144	Janitor	Sir, I would like to have the word "maintenance" written on the back of my unis in tiny light bulbs. That way, when I'm on a break, I can turn it off, like a taxi.
27145	Dr. Kelso	Your friend settled. It's over.
27146	Ted	I got seven Sunday's off a year. YAY!
27147	J.D.'s Narration	...or letting go of your old booty call and making him your boyfriend.
27148	Elliot	Hey. You wanna go for dinner tonight? And I mean at seven, not midnight.
27149	Keith	I'd love that.
27150	J.D.'s Narration	But there's nothing more difficult than letting go of someone you cared about.
27151	Dr. Cox	She was a great old gal.
27152	J.D.	She was.
27153	Dr. Hedrick	Hey! Acceptance!
27154	Dr. Kelso	Damn bikes!
27155	Dr. Cox	Boy, sometimes you just gotta love Kelso.
27156	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
27157	J.D.'s Narration	It was a beautiful day. So I invited Elliot over to my half-acre for some friendly sunbathing.Unfortunately, she brought Keith.
27158	Elliot	Oh, thanks for doing that, J.D., I do it myself, but the Bopsie twins are already loose.
27159	J.D.	Don't worry. It's not that homoerotic, is it?
27160	Keith	Oh, God, no.
27161	J.D.'s Narration	Keith didn't know I mildly disliked him. He also didn't know I was rubbing Crisco on his back.
27162	Keith	Does it smell like pie crust?
27163	J.D.	That's the rhododendron, Keith, everybody knows they smell like pie when they bloom.
27164	Elliot	Hey, nice new watch, J.D.
27165	J.D.	Thank you!
27166	J.D.'s Narration	It wasn't a watch. Now that Elliot had gotten serious with Keith, I needed to get tighter with Turk. And since he's so busy being married and trying to have a baby, I had only one option.
27167	J.D.	Come in, brown bear.
27168	J.D.'s Narration	I got us watchie-talkies
27169	Turk	Hey, white shadow.
27170	J.D.	That's not my handle.
27171	Turk	Hey, Gizmo.
27172	J.D.	Right on. Hey, what are you doing, man? I'm about to take out the slip and slide. Let's do it.
27173	Turk	Dude I can't.It's baby-making time. How's it going with Keith?
27174	J.D.	Awesome, check this.
27175	Turk	Bacon back! Classic!
27176	Carla	Hey stud, you ready to fertilize an egg?
27177	Turk	Gotta go. Maintain radio silence on all channels.
27178	J.D.'s Narration	A local magazine named Dr. Cox the best doctor in the city. Dr. Cox felt this was big news.
27179	Dr. Cox	All right. Here's how it's going to work, people. I'm going to ask each and every one of you just exactly who is the very finest physician in this city. To which you will respond: "You are!" If you do not reply in a timely and exuberant fashion, my associate here will take his mop, and these are his words, not mine, popsicle you.Now, my lovely ex-wife will demonstrate. Darling, just exactly who is the very best physician in our fair city?
27180	Jordan	You are. And now, as agreed, you owe me a night on the town and some me actually getting to finish sex.
27181	Dr. Cox	Well done. Now, down the line we go.
27182	Nurse	You are!
27183	Patient	You are!
27184	Nurse	You are!
27185	Laverne	You are!
27186	Lonnie	Yar!GOD! Why?
27187	Janitor	You combined "you" and "are," you said "yar." It made no sense.
27188	Dr. Cox	It's true, Lonnie. Everyone heard it. Poke him again.
27189	Lonnie	Dihh.
27190	Dr. Cox	Bob Kelso, will you be joining us?
27191	Dr. Kelso	Hmm? There was a line. I assumed it had something to do with cupcakes.
27192	Dr. Cox	Bob, obviously you read the article.
27193	Dr. Kelso	Perry, the last publication I read was the issue of "Out" my son left by the crapper when he was home this weekend asking for money. You'll never get my validation, hot shot.
27194	Dr. Cox	And just exactly where was the poke?
27195	Janitor	Mm. I froze. Give me another twenty bucks, I'll go crack him over the head.
27196	Dr. Cox	Eh, kill him if you have to.
27197	Turk	That was amazing baby. I've never felt so close to you.
27198	Carla	Oh, me too. Ahh. Turk?
27199	Turk	Were you not done cuddling honey? Because I was thinking we could go over to J.D's half-acre, put a blanket down, you can lie on my lap while I stroke your hair.
27200	Carla	Real reason, Turk.
27201	Turk	J.D. has a slip and slide and I want to show him some of my slammin' new moves. I call this "The Captain."Right? And there's this one: "The Dolphin."
27202	Carla	I swear Turk, sometimes I think you and J.D. are more of a couple than we are.
27203	J.D.	Tell her I've known you longer.
27204	Carla	Ugh.
27205	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
27206	Keith	Yeah, I just don't usually burn this bad.
27207	Elliot	Ohh. Don't worry, later I'm going to find some aloe and rub it on wherever it hurts.
27208	Keith	Well, it's just on my back, really.
27209	Elliot	Keith, that was innuendo, you were going to work on this.
27210	Keith	Oh, right, right, right, right. OK, um, it also hurts under my pants in my pants. Dammit! I can't get this!
27211	Elliot	Sweetie, you'll get it. You'll get it.What? Laverne, what?
27212	Laverne	No judgment here, child.
27213	J.D.'s Narration	People were starting to talk about Elliot and Keith. But I decided to stay above the fray. Then I changed my mind.
27214	J.D.	Can you believe those two?
27215	Laverne	No, I can't. All that carrying on in public.
27216	Nurse #1	It's way too much.
27217	J.D.	It's just too much. Sorry, I switched places so I could go again.
27218	Rex	Dr. Dorian?
27219	J.D.	Yes, Rex?
27220	Rex	Uh, Mrs. LeVinne won't take her medication.
27221	J.D.	Mrs. LeVinne has dementia, Rex, and I know she loves sweets. So take the pill, put it in some raspberry jam, put it on your finger, dip it in her mouth, helloo!
27222	J.D.'s Narration	Rex would forever remember that morning as the time he lost his fingertip. But with patients, it's luck of the draw. you can't choose how tolerant they are.
27223	Patient	Young man, can you make sure they don't give me any black blood?
27224	Turk	I'll try.
27225	J.D.'s Narration	You can't choose how classy they are.
27226	Carla	Oh, your hernia stitches look great, Mr. Borland.
27227	Mr. Borland	Could you give them a kiss?
27228	Carla	Maybe later.
27229	Dr. Cox	Hello.
27230	Patient	It's about time. Are you my doctor?
27231	Dr. Cox	Yes, I am. I'm gonna go ahead and give a second so you can think about how lucky that makes you.
27232	Patient	Don't try to be funny. Now here's a list of things I'm going to need you to take care of.
27233	Dr. Cox	That is so helpful. Let's take a look at this.
27234	Keith	Hey!
27235	Elliot	Hey, when are you coming over tonight?
27236	Keith	I can't, I'm on call. I'm really worried about a patient with metastatic adenocarcinoma.
27237	Elliot	Aww, see this is why I hate cancer.
27238	Dr. Cox	Listen up!
27239	Keith	You are!
27240	Dr. Cox	We're not doing that anymore. Now, you're fairly strong at diagnosing, right?
27241	Keith	Yes, sir.
27242	Dr. Cox	Terrific. I need to you to go upstairs and figure out what's wrong with that darn third-floor coffee machine. And Gandharoo, I need you to talk to a young pregnant black girl who will not let me call her mom.
27243	Turk	Why would she listen to me?
27244	Dr. Cox	I may have told her that you're Kanye West.
27245	Turk	I'm actually all right with that.
27246	Dr. Cox	Let's go, group.
27247	Elliot	They are three manly men.
27248	Jordan	Perry gets his chest waxed.
27249	Elliot	Keith likes to knit throw pillows.
27250	Carla	Turk might be sterile.
27251	Jordan	We have a winner.
27252	Carla	I can't get pregnant and I already got a fertility test.
27253	Elliot	So why don't you just ask him to get tested?
27254	Carla	Oh, Turk is very sensitive when it comes to his manliness. Remember when I told him his backpack looked like a purse?Turk, honey, I didn't mean it.
27255	Turk	I'm a man! And a man does not carry a purse! GAAAHHH!! AAAH!
27256	Carla	Yeah, ha ha ha, huh.
27257	Elliot	So, if you can't ask him to get tested, then what the hell are you going to do?
27258	Carla	That's easy. I'm gonna sperm-jack him.
27259	Elliot	All right, everyone, I've made a little tweak to the schedule. Uh, Lisa, you're on tonight and Keith is off because he's got some hospital-related business to tend to.
27260	Lisa	Agh-k-pbth.
27261	Elliot	Hey, don't give me that look, Lisa, you'd be off if you had a good reason.
27262	Lisa	Like if you and I were sleeping together?
27263	Elliot	First of all, the only woman in this hospital that I would even consider sleeping with is is Jamie in pediatrics, mmmm.And, secondly, uh, I'm the attending. So tough tuckus.
27264	J.D.	Uh, wow.
27265	Lisa	It's just so unfair!
27266	Gloria	So unfair.
27267	J.D.	It really is unfair, you guys!
27268	Turk	Hey, Gizmo, can you check on Mr. Jensen for me?
27269	J.D.	No problem, brown bear. Are you nude right now?
27270	Turk	Yeah! How did you know?
27271	J.D.	Because your voice is always higher when you're nude.
27272	Turk	Ha ha ha! That's true!
27273	Dr. Cox	It's not weird that you know that at all.
27274	Patient	Uh, Bob, just a note about the tapioca, I'm much more partial to flan.
27275	Dr. Kelso	You're a flan fan? Fun to say, more fun to eat. Anyway, anything that you need, you just ask Dr. Cox. Perry, Bonnie here is an old friend.
27276	Dr. Cox	Can't say I'm shocked.
27277	Dr. Kelso	Take care of her.
27278	Dr. Cox	You can count on me, Bobboo.Here's the lowdown. In three hours my shift ends, at which point I will be leaving you and meeting with my ex-wife for a celebratory best doctor in the city date guaranteed to end in crazy hotel room sex. I'm thinking six-inch heels, a leather mask, and fishnet stockings. Who knows? She may even get dressed up. good news for you though, is that you have a simple case of hyper-calcemia. Any trained monkey can treat it. Let's see who that monkey's gonna be.
27279	Rex	Ooh, banana.
27280	Dr. Cox	Rex it is. Good night. You're in very capable nine-fingered hands.
27281	Turk	I don't know what's gotten into you, baby, but I am turned ON!
27282	Carla	OK, honey, this might feel a little weird, but I promise you, you will love it.
27283	Turk	Honey? How could you think I wouldn't notice this on my dangle?
27284	Carla	You were enjoying it until it started making that grinding noise.
27285	Turk	I know we're having a hard time getting pregnant. But sweetness, it could be you.
27286	Carla	I already got tested.
27287	Turk	Oh.
27288	Carla	Turk...
27289	Turk	I'm a man! And I can make babies!
27290	Dr. Cox	I'm not afraid to tell you, Jordan, I think it's going to be a hell of a night. I got us a penthouse.
27291	Jordan	Great! How much did that run you?
27292	Dr. Cox	Oh, about five bucks. I figure while I'm in the shower you can get yourself revved up.
27293	Jordan	Awesome.
27294	Dr. Cox	Aw, now what the hell, Mongo?
27295	Janitor	Sorry. I'm his man now.
27296	Dr. Kelso	Hello, Perry.
27297	Janitor	Now don't get me wrong. I hit him hard, twice. It just made him mad. That guy's got a skull like a mountain goat.
27298	Dr. Kelso	Perry, when I told you to treat Mrs. Cooke, I meant it. If I'd wanted to waste my breath I would have given my wife mouth-to-mouth when she went into cardiac arrest. She's OK, my mistress used to be a lifeguard. Now, get your ass back in there.
27299	Dr. Cox	I'm sorry, baby. It looks like we're gonna have to take a rain check.
27300	Jordan	No, you are.
27301	Janitor	Enjoy your evening, ma'am.
27302	Jordan	Thank you.
27303	Janitor	No can do.
27304	Elliot	Hey, we're gonna get going.
27305	Dr. Cox	No, no, no, no, there is no way that you get to spring your little boy toy here for a night of passionless passion while my ass is stuck here and Jordan is in a hotel somewhere whispering sweet nothings to a shower nozzle.
27306	Elliot	Aww uhh.
27307	J.D.	I'm gonna go hang out back here.
27308	Dr. Cox	I tell you what we're gonna do. We'll leave it up to your interns. Who here doesn't think that Barbie should abuse her power?Ah. There we go. Face-jock stays.
27309	J.D's Narration	It's a strange feeling when everyone is stuck in hell, and you're not.
27310	Turk	I might be sterile?
27311	Carla	Oh, honey, stay calm. Nobody knows but us.
27312	J.D.	You firing blanks, buddy?
27313	Turk	Ohhh....
27314	J.D.'s Narration	I was just glad to watch TV and for once, not be in a world of crap.
27315	Elliot	Why didn't you stand up for me?
27316	J.D.'s Narration	Or not.
27317	Elliot	Attendings switch schedules all the time, J.D. You switched last week and I totally defended you. You know what's really going on here? You don't like Keith. Go ahead, tell me I'm wrong.Thanks, J.D. You're a great friend.
27318	Turk	At least you're not sterile.
27319	J.D.	Amen to that, C-Bear.
27320	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
27321	J.D.'s Narration	The next morning, I braced myself for Elliot's odd brand of revenge.And there it was.
27322	J.D.	Did you individually drain all my eggs?
27323	Elliot	Morning!
27324	J.D.	Fine, I'll just have an apple.
27325	Elliot	Oh, looking for this?
27326	J.D.	How did you do that?I'm having a rough morning, Brown Bear, how you doing with your sterility?
27327	Turk	Uhh, can't talk about that right now, I'm in an elevator.
27328	J.D.	Not reading you, Brown Bear! I repeat, are you still sterile?
27329	Laverne	This is so juicy I feel dizzy.
27330	Turk	Stupid watchie-talkie.
27331	Laverne	I heard they're trying to have children, but they can't because he
27332	Carla	Don't worry, baby. I'll kick her ass for you later.
27333	Turk	Mmm.
27334	Carla	We can go to the fertility clinic after work.
27335	Turk	I can handle this thing by myself. Besides, when you went to get your fertility test you didn't take me.
27336	Carla	Are you sure?
27337	Turk	Yeah, yeah, besides, I've been giving the fellow some inspirational pep talks. Gotta want it, boys! There's no "I" in sperm!
27338	Elliot	Hey! You get a patient with elastic seizures!
27339	Keith	Awesome! Every intern wanted this case.
27340	Carla	Elliot! You're asking for trouble. Everybody's already talking.
27341	Jordan	Mmhmm.
27342	Elliot	Keith is the best intern. I mean he shouldn't be punished because he has to sleep with me.
27343	Jordan	Has to?
27344	Elliot	Ge gets to. He gets to sleep with me. As a woman, have you ever noticed how old self-esteem issues sort of creep up on you?
27345	Carla	I have sausage fingers.
27346	Jordan	Do you remember wen I pulled strings with the board and got Perry that promotion?
27347	Elliot	Yeah.
27348	Jordan	People started talking. And Perry got totally emasculated. So it worked out great for me.
27349	Elliot	I should not care what other people think. Right, Carla? Oh, sweetie, they're beautiful!
27350	Carla	They're kielbasas.
27351	J.D.	Come in, Brown Bear, come in Brown Bear. If you're around, I'm having some java out front.
27352	Janitor	Huah!
27353	J.D.	Waah! I'm hit! I'm hit!
27354	Janitor	Haa! Oh, this is gonna be fantastic.
27355	Turk	All right, look. I know I said I wanted to go by myself to get tested today, but I've been doing some thinking and I'm scared. So, it'd mean a lot if you went with me.
27356	J.D.	Of course, buddy.
27357	Turk	You know I'm not comfortable getting busy with myself.
27358	J.D.	Well, you're in luck. This happens to be my specialty. Here's some tips. If you can't get over the fact that you're doing it to yourself, sit on your arm until it falls asleep, then pull it out and use that. I call it "The Stranger."
27359	Turk	If I ever have kids you are never allowed to babysit.
27360	J.D.	I can't believe you're ready to have kids. We spend all day taking care of old people, washing them, cleaning them, why would you want to bring that home?
27361	Turk	J.D., we're talking about kids. Not going home to a house full of old folks.
27362	J.D.	All right, fellas, two quick announcements! First of all, whoever's been filling up my Tivo with JAG reruns, let's cut it out. Secondly, Harvey, no matter how drunk you get, I like to sleep alone.
27363	Harvey	But I like to snuggle.
27364	J.D.	That's your problem, buddy, I got my own thing.
27365	Nurse	OK, uh, Chris Turk?
27366	Turk	Yeah.
27367	Nurse	We're ready for you.
27368	J.D.	Excuse me, are any of the reading materials in there available for those of us out here?
27369	Janitor	Hey J.D., this is that black surgeon you always hang out with. Come on outside to the ramp dawg.Any second. Any second, now.
27370	Mrs. Cooke	Oh, for God's sake, breathe through your nose. You sound like my bulldog.
27371	Dr. Cox	You know, as a doctor, I rarely root for the disease, but with you, I find myself cheering "Go, hyper-calcemia with underlying M.E.N. syndrome, Go, go go!"
27372	Mrs. Cooke	Do you drink out of the toilet? My bulldog drinks out of the toilet.
27373	Dr. Cox	God Almighty.
27374	Lisa	Dr. Reid. We think it is lame that you give Keith preferential treatment. We're filing a formal complaint with Dr. Kelso.
27375	Elliot	Oh, OK. Sure, you know what? You guys can tell Dr. Kelso whatever you want because all he's gonna hear are the facts. I'm sleeping with Keith, he gets his schedule shifted and he gets the most interesting cases.Well, that's not gonna work because I don't have that much money, so...
27376	Turk	I just got in here!Baby, what are you doing here?
27377	Carla	I was home, thinking about my fertility test and how badly I wanted you to be there with me.
27378	Turk	Baby, I'm a man, and we're not that vulnerable.
27379	Carla	I don't really know why I didn't tell you about it. I guess I was just scared that if I got bad news, I'd be letting you down.
27380	Turk	I can see how you'd feel that way.
27381	Carla	Anyway, I thought I'd come over.
27382	Turk	Aww, thanks, sweetie. But you might want to go outside, because I'm about to fill - this - up.
27383	Carla	Why would I wait outside?
27384	Turk	That's what's up.
27385	Dr. Cox	You are more than welcome to have your goons take both of my thumbs and break them, Bob, but I am officially O-U-T out. I mean, come on. I don't even see how you can like that woman.
27386	Dr. Kelso	I don't. She was married to my best friend, Richard. He died a few years back. You know the deal with friends. If they love them, you have to love them whether you like it or not.
27387	J.D.	Dr. Kelso, do you really believe that? Or are you just saying that to look good? Ah, who am I kidding. You don't care what anybody thinks about you, do you? I gotta tell you though, you gave me some good advice about how to deal with Elliot. Gootchie, gootchie, gootchie goo!
27388	Dr. Kelso	Can I fire him?
27389	Dr. Cox	Sleep on it. Say, one more thing about Devil Lady in there. Why me?
27390	Dr. Kelso	I know it's a minor condition, Perry, but you know how things can turn.
27391	Dr. Cox	But, you wanted me in there because I'm the best, what, Bob?
27392	Dr. Kelso	No.
27393	Dr. Cox	Say it, or I'll go in there and tell her you're dying to be with her a lot more often.Beg pardon?
27394	Dr. Kelso	You're the best doctor.
27395	Dr. Cox	Thank you, Bob. Means a lot to me.
27396	Elliot	Listen, I know that everyone is very upset, but I really don't think that there's any need to bother Dr. Kelso, and uh...
27397	Lisa	It's too late, Dr. Reid.
27398	J.D.	You're right, Lisa, it is too late, because from now on, I'm going to be handing out all the case assignments. For instance, this cool case right here.Should I give it to the most annoying intern? Because that would be you, Lisa. Or maybe I should give it to the most incompetent intern missing a finger, because that would be you Rex. Or maybe I should just give it to the best intern, which would be you, Keith.Now if anyone wants to tell on me, to whomever they like, they can. Good day.Here you go.
27399	Keith	Thanks again, Dr. D.
27400	J.D.	All right, if you like him, I like him.
27401	Turk	Hey! I'm not sterile!
27402	J.D.	Congratulations!
27403	Elliot	Turk's not sterile!
27404	J.D.'s Narration	My friends were all happy. And even though I felt like the fifth wheel, I could take solace in something.
27405	J.D.	Oh, hey, Turk. I forgot, I can't raid the freezer with you.Be careful in there, they lock it up at three.
27406	Janitor	Mmm? Oh. Oh-ho ho. I'm gonna kill him.
27407	J.D.'s Narration	I had finally won one.
27408	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
27409	J.D's Narration	Now that Elliot and Keith were serious, she started buying him gifts.
27410	Keith	Ooh. It's a mouth harp, awesome!
27411	J.D.'s Narration	Keith was shockingly good at pretending to like crappy presents, but you know what he was best at?
27412	J.D.	Keith, we need more popcorn. Yeah.
27413	J.D.'s Narration	Being girl bait.Here's how it goes down. Keith comes back. Elliot marks her territory so the girls know he's taken, and I just pick off one of the smaller, weaker ones that come by for a look-see.
27414	J.D.	I'm a doctor. I'm a land-owner. Burt Reynolds is my father. I love sports.Keith, more popcorn.
27415	Elliot	See? That's how it works.
27416	Girl	You have the cutest hair!
27417	J.D.	These old rags?
27418	Dr. Marston	OK, OK, so you're both, um, fertile, yet you're still unable to conceive, so how often do you make love?
27419	Turk	Twice today.
27420	Carla	Actually it was three times. You were asleep for the last one.
27421	Turk	Oh, wow, that really happened?
27422	Carla	Mmhmm.
27423	Turk	Huh, I thought it was weird that you were in one of my sex dreams.
27424	Carla	He is not allowed to dream about me. It gets too freaky in there.
27425	Turk	Cirque du Soleil freaky. One time, she was skinless.
27426	Dr. Marston	OK, stress is often a factor in conception. So tell me, do you think stress might be an issue?
27427	Carla	I swear, if you don't knock me up tonight, no more sex until you steal me a baby. So do it right this time.
27428	Turk	A little stress.
27429	Dr. Cox	OK, the antibiotics have brought your fever down, is there anything else I can do for you?
27430	Mr. Russell	Yeah, I'm auditioning for my church's senior citizen production of Streetcar Named Desire. Would you mind running lines with me?
27431	Dr. Cox	I'd be happy to.
27432	Mr. Russell	If I didn't know you was my wife's sister, I'd get ideas about you.
27433	Dr. Cox	I can't believe you'd think I'd do this with you. Are you insane? Seriously, I'm a doctor.
27434	Mr. Russell	What page are you on?
27435	J.D.	Why didn't you just read lines with the old guy?
27436	Dr. Cox	My job is to make sick people better, not to help Bernie in there score a slice of Episcopalian tail on opening night.
27437	J.D.	Sometimes you gotta go the extra mile with patients. That's what makes me such a special doctor.
27438	Dr. Cox	That, and your amazing ability to switch back and forth seamlessly between male and female genitalia.
27439	J.D.	Oooh.
27440	Dr. Cox	Newbie, snap out of it. I don't have time for your daydreaming.
27441	J.D.	Personally, me, I believe that medicine is about more than just treating the disease. You gotta be there for people. Take Mrs. Cohen, right? When she broke her hip I treated that, but she had also left her car double-parked, so being an "extra mile" kinda guy, I went and took car of it.Sorry. It's been a little while since I drove stick.I wonder how she got out of that truck. That's how she broke her hip.
27442	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
27443	J.D.	Look, all I'm saying is it's important to go the extra mile with patients. It's like what I was telling this girl last night.
27444	Dr. Cox	Why would you tell her that?
27445	J.D.	I didn't. I just wanted to show you who I'm going out with tonight.
27446	Dr. Cox	Look, Newbie, there's a reason I can't go the extra mile with patients. It's something personal.
27447	J.D.	You can confide in me.
27448	Dr. Cox	I'm a *good* doctor. Kelly Rippa!
27449	J.D.'s Narration	It didn't bother me that Dr. Cox just "Kelly Rippa'd" me because I knew it would never catch on, no matter how much he wanted it to. This, however, did upset me.
27450	J.D.	Uh, Carol, we got the bone marrow biopsy back and, uh, I'm afraid you have leukemia.
27451	Carol	What?
27452	J.D.	Yes, but the good news is it's very treatable. We just have to get started right away.
27453	Dr. Cox	You know, in four and a half years, I've watched your pal, Stephanie, go through a multitude of irritating fads. The Ugg boots, the campaign for better grammar among the staff, and of course, double European air kiss, and seeing as you two are sorority sisters, I was kinda hoping you could tell me when this extra mile crap is going to end.
27454	Turk	Oh, it's never gonna end. He's relentless. Why do you think I was out Sunday Morning buying comics for my patient?
27455	Dr. Cox	They were giving out free Tastykakes at the comic book store? Ah HA! That used to work better when you were a fat load. Dammit.
27456	Turk	All right Jake, here it is. The latest "Vengeance." I had to travel to five stores to find that.
27457	Jake	This is last month's.
27458	Turk	Look, I'll track down a new one for you later, but right now I gotta make sure I have a job next year. OK?
27459	J.D.'s Narration	Since there were only three attending spots for ten surgical residents, Dr. Kelso could basically treat them like his own personal valets.
27460	Dr. Kelso	All-day sucker my ass. Try twenty minutes.
27461	Carla	Sir, quick question?
27462	Dr. Kelso	Make it very quick, I'm about to vomit.
27463	Carla	Why was I told to drop everything and look after some new patient coming in?
27464	Dr. Kelso	Mr. Sommers is a cousin of one of the trustees. Not important enough to warrant any face time with me, but connected enough that if one of those ding-dongs kills him, it will be my ass.
27465	J.D.	Carla, can you cover my patients?
27466	Dr. Kelso	She's already watching someone for me.
27467	J.D.	All right, I'll find somebody else.
27468	Carla	Why? Because I'm just a nurse and I can't look after everybody?
27469	Dr. Kelso	Precisely.
27470	Carla	J.D., why don't you tell me whats wrong with your patient, Mrs. Jones?Without looking at her chart?
27471	J.D.'s Narration	Carla knew that without their charts, doctors didn't know much about their patients.
27472	J.D.	Mr. Barry, I misplaced your chart, I forgot, what's wrong with you again?Oh, that's right, you have a kitty-cat stuck in your mouth.Or should I say you have a person stuck around you, little guy? Gootchie, gootchie.It's not like nurses know everything.
27473	J.D.'s Thoughts	Uh-oh. Carla's gearing up to explode. Save yourself. Attempt a casual side-switch.And you're there. Now angry at Kelso.
27474	J.D.	Bob, how dare you?
27475	Carla	Exactly! You're worried about what I can handle? Vascular surgery wants an update every two hours on bed one. I'm weaning Mrs. Jones' dopamine from ten mics to five, Mrs. Meyersons's abdominal wound is dehiscing and Mr. Wilder's about to be turfed to psych because he thinks he's Flo from Alice.
27476	Mr. Wilder	Kiss my grits!
27477	Carla	Exactly, Flo, exactly.
27478	J.D.	I hoped you learned something today.
27479	Dr. Cox	Get a load of Mr. Extra-Mile-Guy's leukemia patient sitting there all by herself. Knowing him, he's probably out getting her a cake shaped like a cancerous white blood cell.
27480	J.D.	All right, team, let's stay close. Come on. Carol! Look who I found!
27481	Carol	Larry? Dad? How...?
27482	J.D.	Well, right after I got your test results back, I got on the horn with your dad and we started a phone tree to find everyone. There were some tears, mostly mine, but we got it done.
27483	Carol	You are the most amazing doctor.
27484	J.D.	Hear that, Perry? I'm the most amazing doctor because I went the extra 5280 feet. What's that? That's right, it's a mile. And how does that make me feel? Keith!Thank you.
27485	Dr. Kelso	Attention, surgical residents still hoping to have a job next year. The annual blood drive is upon us and I will be needing a volunteer to greet our donors as the hospital's new mascot, the friendly hypodermic needle, Mr. Prick.We'll probably change the name.
27486	Turk	I'm so sick of this. If the jobs were given to whoever's the best surgeon I would get all three of those damn spots.
27487	Elliot	It's the same on the medical side. I swear, the only the only reason I got that oncology rotation is because I let Dr. Morgan take me as his date his brother's wedding.
27488	Turk	Ricky Morgan?
27489	Elliot	Mmhmm.
27490	Turk	He works in the cafeteria.
27491	Elliot	What?!
27492	Turk	What?
27493	Elliot	Listen, kissing ass is the way it's done around here and there's nothing you can do about it.
27494	Turk	We have to all band together and agree not to be exploited by Dr. Kelso. From now on, we'll only be judged by our skill and abilities. Who's with me? That's right! That's right!From here on out, no more getting him coffee, no more washing his car, no more taking his son to the local steam baths to meet men!
27495	Todd	Well, hey, you guys got him coffee.
27496	Turk	Together on three. One, two, three.
27497	All	Together!!
27498	Mr. Sommers	What are you doing?
27499	Carla	Chief of Medicine said to pay special attention to you and I like to take a couple of seconds to get to know my patients. So first question: Are you allergic to any
27500	Janitor	Psst!
27501	Carla	What?
27502	Janitor	I need some advice.Which do you prefer?
27503	Carla	What's the occasion?
27504	Janitor	Me, wiping up gunk. I was cleaning Kelso's tie rack and I assumed I could have it. I find the Armani is very effective on urine, whereas the Yves Saint-Laurent is good for
27505	Carla	No, no.What? Where'd he go?
27506	J.D.'s Narration	Carol's family had welcomed me as one of their own. No more so than her brother, Larry.
27507	J.D.	EAGLE!
27508	Larry	I told you not to call me Lawrence.
27509	J.D.	And I told you I never get dizzy!OK, let me tell you guys why we're here. Carol is starting a journey, OK? Obviously the chemo is gonna be tough, but we're all here for you. Anything you go through, we go through together.
27510	Dr. Kelso	So. You've all banded together. I honestly never thought I'd see the day when we would pick the three surgeons who would care for the people of this great hospital based solely on merit. I hope you're proud of yourselves.
27511	Dr. Wen	This is a preliminary ranking of your technical skills. So, whenever you get a chance.
27512	J.D.'s Narration	Life in a hospital is constantly humbling. Whether it's making you realize you're not as skilled as you thought...
27513	Turk	Fourth?! I'm fourth!
27514	J.D.'s Narration	...or as on the ball as you thought.
27515	Dr. Kelso	How's Mr. Sommers doing?
27516	Janitor	Actually, sir
27517	Carla	He's perfectly fine, sir, he's in tip-top shape.
27518	Dr. Kelso	Good.
27519	Carla	Ow! What are you wearing, a cup?
27520	Janitor	Well, people try to hit me there more than you'd think.
27521	Carla	Ow.
27522	J.D.'s Narration	The key is to be ready for it.
27523	J.D.	I was not ready for this.
27524	Larry	Since Carol's going to lose all her hair in chemo, we decided we'd all shave our heads now. He even agreed to do the cutting.
27525	Dr. Cox	You're up next, there, big guy. I mean, come on. You're all in this together, right?
27526	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
27527	J.D.	I can't believe you all shaved your heads. Oh, great, even Nana. You don't look creepy, or alien-like at all.
27528	Dr. Cox	Are you ready to run the extra mile?
27529	J.D.'s Thoughts	You can't let him know that you don't want to do this. Meet his gaze. Meet it twice as hard!
27530	Nurse	Dr. Dorian, we need you. Mr. Bentley's condition is getting worse.
27531	J.D.'s Thoughts	God bless his herpes.
27532	J.D.	I'm going to go take care of that man and when I come back...
27533	J.D.'s Thoughts	Pause for effect. Pause for effect.
27534	J.D.	We're gonna shave this thing.
27535	Turk	How the hell could I be fourth? I know Bonnie's good, and Figsack has mad hands, but somehow I keep forgetting that Todd is a skilled surgeon.
27536	Todd	Hey, how come you didn't page me back about that surgical consult?
27537	Elliot	I did. You're wearing your garage door opener on your hip.
27538	Turk	Ladies and gentlemen, number two.
27539	Carla	Kelso's gonna kill me. I can't find Mr. Summer.
27540	Janitor	Did you look between Mr. Spring and Mr. Fall? Ha ha! Too easy.
27541	Carla	Hey, you know wha ?More armor?
27542	Janitor	No, actually, I um, sneaking trays out of the cafeteria. I'm building a shed.
27543	Carla	This is partially your fault, so you're gonna help me find him.
27544	Doug	You know, whenever I lose something in the morgue, I just retrace my steps. Like right now, I'm looking for something, and I know I came to the vending machine, and then I dropped a quarter, which rolled over here and yep, there you are.As soon as you take your eyes off them, you lose them. They're like children. Big, dead children.
27545	Elliot	Oh my God, I treated that girl at the free clinic. She was born without nipples.
27546	J.D.	I knew there had to be something wrong with her, she's too perfect!
27547	Elliot	I was kidding, J.D. I have never seen her in my life. Kelly Rippa!
27548	Dr. Cox	I told you it would catch on.
27549	J.D.	I don't think it's funny.
27550	Dr. Cox	How's that leukemia patient of yours doing?
27551	J.D.	I'm hiding. I really don't want to be bald. I have a sneaking suspicion it won't work for me. It think it might accentuate my spoon chest.
27552	Dr. Cox	Mm.
27553	J.D.	Plus, the girl I'm dating is totally into my hair.
27554	Dr. Cox	She's gotta be interested in more than just your hair.
27555	Girl	If it weren't for your hair, I don't think I'd be remotely interested in you.
27556	J.D.	I'm sure there's something else she's into.
27557	Girl	No, there's nothing else.
27558	J.D.	There is, even if she won't admit it. You know what, I'm stuck, man. I have to shave this down.
27559	Dr. Cox	No you don't. You don't have to go the extra mile. That's what I've been trying to tell you. What the hell happened to the days when you used to listen to me?
27560	J.D.	That was a long time ago. Maybe you should listen to me for once.
27561	Dr. Cox	Not in this lifetime. Listen, Newbie, you're not a completely terrible, horrible, incompetent doctor and while I would never let any of my blood relatives be your patient, if it was someone that I knew, an acquaintance, I might be OK with you treating them.
27562	J.D.	Thank you.
27563	Dr. Cox	The only thing you owe Carol is to treat her the best you can.
27564	Larry	Hey, where you been?
27565	J.D.	Oh, Larry, man, I don't think I can shave my head.
27566	Larry	What about Carol?
27567	J.D.	She'll be OK. She has all you guys.
27568	Carla	You look over there.
27569	Janitor	Mmhmm.
27570	Turk	Excuse me, nurse? Hi, how about a poke?
27571	Carla	I have a husband, OK? And he's big and he's black and he's
27572	Turk	Baby! Baby, it's me. And I do love that you go to that big and black stuff.
27573	Carla	I can't wait to bear the fruit of your loins.
27574	Turk	W- Baby, wait! This is the only way I can I can suck up to Kelso without the other surgeons knowing about it!
27575	Janitor	There you are. You're not Mr. Sommers.
27576	Turk	No, I'm not.
27577	Janitor	No, I'm not.
27578	Turk	Wassup? Wit..Wit y'all?
27579	Jake	Dr. Turk, what happened to you?
27580	Turk	I found the latest issue of "Vengeance" at a comic book store a mile and half away. Here you go. Actually, I ran there in a foam needle suit, but you don't care.
27581	Jake	Thanks, Dr. Turk.
27582	Dr. Wen	Christopher, I heard you were sweating the rankings.
27583	Turk	No. I'm married and trying to have a baby. Not having a job would be a big boost for me.
27584	Dr. Wen	You're a good surgeon. Plus, your bedside manner is really important. There's no one on that list who spends more time with their patients as you do.
27585	Turk	Are you saying I have a job? If you are trying to Kelly Rippa me right now, I will freak out.Haha. I got a job!
27586	Janitor	Well, the good news is, his head isn't in the storage room. Because I once found a head in the storage room. It's a funny story actually. I put it in my locker because I didn't have time to get down to lost and found. Went on a long weekend and forgot all about it. Come back on Monday, open my locker, whooaaa! Head, plus rats! I panicked. I didn't know what to do, so I grabbed it and I ran up to the roof and I punt it! And I shank it wide left, like I always do. Now, it's heading right down to where Kelso is sitting in his convertible. I'm done. I'm out of a job, right? Wrong! At that second, a hawk flies in and grabs the thing and flies off with it. I know what you're thinking: we're in the middle of a city, what's a hawk doing there?
27587	Carla	I can't believe you get a locker and I don't.
27588	Ricky Morgan	Dr. Reid? I need to meet you in radiology to, you know, go over some test results.
27589	Elliot	Yeah, it's over, Ricky.
27590	Ricky Morgan	I know you're stealing trays. Stop it.
27591	Janitor	Buzz off.
27592	Elliot	Carla, the orderly lost my chart for Mr. Tyler in 406. Would we have his dosages in here somewhere?
27593	Carla	You were gonna put him on penicillin, but he was allergic so put him on a gram of engemycin.
27594	Elliot	Thank you.
27595	Janitor	You should put some of that crazy nurse memory to use on our missing dude.
27596	Carla	Well, he was an older guy. And he was on an IV so he couldn't have gotten very far.He was jittery. And he had this weird circle tanline on his arm. It was the nicotine patch! He was trying to quit smoking.
27597	Mr. Sommers	Should I not be out here?
27598	Dr. Kelso	There he is, Mr. Spot-On-His-Lung! Don't you worry, we'll pop that lung out of there, get it off to the dry-cleaners and have back to you a little after five. Ha ha ha! We like to have fun.
27599	Janitor	You know, I made up that whole hawk story.
27600	Carla	Yeah. I know you're not as weird as you want people to think you are.
27601	J.D.	Whew.Whoa! Nana, how you doing? Looking hot in the track suit. Gym's on the second floor.
27602	J.D.'s Thoughts	Date time.
27603	Turk	Dude! There you are. Two things, first, the aliens are here and they're wearing track suits.
27604	J.D.	Oh no, that's Nana.
27605	Turk	Oh. Second, I got a job.
27606	J.D.	Nice.
27607	Turk	And if you hadn't pushed me to do all of that extra mile stuff, that probably wouldn't have happened. So, thank you. You got a hottie waiting for you at the bar. You go get her.
27608	J.D.	Woo! Ah. Where were we?
27609	Girl	Do I smell banana conditioner?
27610	J.D.	That's one of my conditioners, yes.
27611	J.D.'s Narration	As great as this was, I couldn't stop thinking about what Turk said and howWhoa, this girl really digs hair. The point is, it's hard getting what happens at the hospital out of your head.
27612	J.D.	AAHHH!
27613	Carla	How was your first stress-free day?
27614	Turk	Horrible. And you?
27615	Carla	Worse.
27616	Turk	Mm.
27617	Carla	Let's have a baby. If it doesn't work this time I'll kill myself.
27618	Turk	Not helping with the stress.
27619	J.D.'s Narration	I knew if I didn't leave that bar and go back, I'd never be able to enjoy any of the simple things. Even a woman eating my former bangs.
27620	J.D.	Voila!
27621	J.D.'s Narration	See, that's the thing about and extra mile guy. You never know who it's going to rub off on.
27622	Mr. Russell	Sister Blanche, I've got a little birthday remembrance for you.
27623	Dr. Cox	Oh? Have you, Stanley? I wasn't expecting any.
27624	Mr. Russell	I hope you like it.
27625	Dr. Cox	Uhhh...
27626	Mr. Russell	You're hating this, aren't you?
27627	Dr. Cox	No, that's that's not it at all. It's just that I don't believe for a second that you really want me to leave. You gotta feel the love, you gotta get involved. What do you people say, let's take it from the top?
27628	Mr. Russell	Sister Blanche, I've got a little birthday remembrance for you.
27629	Dr. Cox	Again. Do it with some force.

27633	Turk	This here is an electronic hide and seek game. The other person wears a sensor and the closer you get, the more it beeps.
27634	Elliot	Ah. Funsies. So Mrs. Facter here has a ??? and needs a surgical consult.
27635	Turk	Fire away.
27636	Elliot	See her red highlights?
27637	Turk	Yes.
27638	Elliot	Could I pull those off or am I so kidding myself?
27639	Turk	I really don't have time for this.
27640	Elliot	Turk, you're playing hide and seek.
27641	Turk	with my nine year-old gleoblastoma patient, Eric. He's been in the hospital for a month. I think he deserves a little fun, don't you?
27642	Elliot	Sorry, Turk.
27643	Turk	Hee hee hee hee!
27644	J.D.	How bad would she look with red highlights?
27645	Turk	I know. It is now my turn to hide.
27646	J.D.	All right, I'll count. Close a brother up.
27647	Elliot	So, I like to remember all of the carpal bones in the hand with a simple mnemonic device: Scaphoid, Lunate, Triquetrum, Pisiform, Trapezium, Trapezoid, Capitate and Hamate. Some Lovers Try Positions that They Can't Handle.
27648	Keith	Hey!
27649	Elliot	That was not directed at you, Doctor. But you should stretch first next time we try the whirlybird.
27650	Dr. Cox	Excuse me, but does anyone here happen to have a plate of Jeebies? Because these two here just have me a big, old scoop of the Heebies. Seriously, it cannot just be me.I want to hear from the audience, I do. Dating in the workplace: She's the boss, he's the pretty intern, tell me what's bugging you. Courage.
27651	Gloria	Well, sometimes they arrive in the morning and they smell like sex.
27652	Dr. Cox	Gloria, telling it like it smells. I'm proud of you. Barbie, who hurt you?
27653	Elliot	Is there something you want?
27654	Dr. Cox	Actually, yes. It is one of those rare days where you can be of use to me. You speak German, I have a patient from Berlin, and I need to tell the gentleman he has fluid in his lungs.
27655	Elliot	Ihre Frau hat einen schoenen busen.
27656	Dr. Cox	Ihre Frau hat einen schunnen busen.
27657	Elliot	Schoenen busen.
27658	Dr. Cox	Ihre Frau hat einen schoenen busen.
27659	German Guy	Was hast du gerade gesagt?
27660	Dr. Cox	Schoenen busen. How are you?
27661	Turk	Relax, dude. Just playing a little electronic hide and seek. Hey, baby...Yeah I know my shift's over...No, I'm not fooling around with J.D., I'm...OK, cool, I'm on my way home.
27662	Carla	All right, I just took the pregnancy test. Just tell me when a minute's up.
27663	Turk	I just put some pizza rolls in the microwave. The minute that bad boy dings, we're good to go.
27664	Carla	Oh my God, I can't stand it, thirty more seconds!
27665	Turk	OK, don't get too excited. They have to cool off for a minute. That cheese is like lava!
27666	Carla	Is there a bigger idiot than you in the entire world?
27667	J.D.	I'm seeking you, Turk!
27668	Carla	It's negative.
27669	Turk	Look at me. Hey, look at me. It's gonna happen.
27670	Carla	Eat your pizza rolls. I gotta get to work.By the way, next time buy a name-brand pregnancy test, not that cheap generic one.
27671	Turk	If you would raise my allowance, I wouldn't have to bargain shop so I could buy pizza rolls. Secondly, this pregnancy test works just as well as the name-brand one!Wait a second. Results in three minutes.
27672	J.D.'s Narration	Some things deserve to get tossed out on their asses.
27673	Dr. Cox	OH! Oooh! Schoenen busen.
27674	J.D.'s Narration	But the thing you shouldn't toss out is a pregnancy test that takes two minutes longer than you thought.
27675	Turk	Oh my God, we're pregnant.WAAHAAA! AAAAAHAAAAAAHAAAAAA!!

27680	Janitor	When I was 19, I was a world-class 110-meter hurdler.Still remember nationals like they were yesterday.
27681	Announcer	Runners, take your positions. On your mark, set...
27682	Janitor	Good race.They offered me a full ride and Grambling, but then I slept with the President's daughter. Not the college president, the President of the United States. But, hey, if Amy Carter asks you out for a nightcap, you do not say no.
27683	J.D.	No. No more. Here are some of the lies you've told us over the last five years: You went to Harvard. You have a wife who only has a pointer and thumb-pinky. You have a a brother-dad, a mother-sister. You have two kids, no wait, you have one kid, no wait, you had a baby with a Chinese local, you're a deaf-mute, oh wait, now you're telling us that you're a world class hurdler and you slept with the beautiful and irreplaceable Amy Carter?
27684	Janitor	I I didn't sleep with Amy Carter. We did everything but.
27685	J.D.	Ohh...
27686	Janitor	And I really was a world-class hurdler.
27687	J.D.	We're not buying it, are we gang?
27688	Everyone	No, nah, heck no...
27689	J.D.	The people have spoken. Allow me to bask in the glow.
27690	Turk	Oh-ho! J.D., guess what?
27691	J.D.	Not now, Turk, I'm glow-basking.
27692	Turk	Dude, listen to me!!Where is Carla?
27693	Dr. Cox	She just went downstairs. What is all the excitement?
27694	J.D.	You tell him. Aw, just wait a mi OK, you tell him.
27695	Turk	We're having a baby.
27696	Dr. Cox	Red states be damned, I'm sure you're going to make great fathers.
27697	Elliot	What's going on?
27698	J.D.	Why don't I tell
27699	Turk	OK, you go
27700	J.D.	Uh, Carla, preggo!
27701	Elliot	Oh, my God, Turk! Carla must be so happy!
27702	Turk	I haven't told her yet. I'm gonna go tell her now.
27703	J.D.	Wait, Turk! When has a man ever been able to tell his wife that she's pregnant? Allow me to paint you a picture with my imagination brush, OK? You two come out in the parking lot where all Carla's friends have gathered. They're holding a giant banner that says "Carla, you're pregnant, and I dove you." Did I say "dove?" I did, Turk. That's when I cue the bird-wrangler who releases 500 white doves into the air. Where do they land? I don't know. But one thing Carla knows is that in her uterus is a little, soft, baby Turk.
27704	Turk	Are you forgetting what happened when you made me have doves at my parents' anniversary party?
27705	J.D.	This won't be indoors, Turk, and there certainly won't be all those people throwing bird seed. Why were people throwing seed? It's a the point is that you, my friend, have a chance to be on the greatest surprise a husband has ever pulled for his wife. And you get credit for it the length of your entire marriage.
27706	Turk	I'm in!
27707	J.D.	Great, I'll tell everybody. You find Carla. Dr. Cox
27708	Dr. Cox	Halt! I will be doing nothing.
27709	Elliot	Well, you at least won't tell Carla, right?
27710	Dr. Cox	Ever since I was blitzkrieg'd this morning by an enraged German named Otto, a certain Dr. Barbie no longer exists for me. So, if she was to ask me a question, I wouldn't be able to hear it, and you'd have to repeat it.
27711	J.D.	Can you just please not tell Carla?
27712	Dr. Cox	Fine.
27713	J.D.	And Elliot, if you see Carla, don't get emotional.
27714	Elliot	Oh, no problem.
27715	J.D.	Really? Baby.
27716	Elliot	Oh, my God, Turk, Carla's gonna be so happy!
27717	Turk	The family wants me to do hip surgery, what are they thinking? The guy is 92!
27718	Carla	He's their grandfather. It's not like they can go to a kennel and they can pick out another one.
27719	Woman	We just got a lot of great new grandfathers in.
27720	J.D.	OK. Oooh, look at this one, he's so cute!
27721	Old man	Hey! Get out of my yard!
27722	Woman	He's not good with people.He's great, but we don't want to separate them.
27723	J.D.	I already have a grandma.If I get one this little, everyone's gonna think I'm gay.Aw, look at this fellow. Come here boy, I got a little hard candy for you.Yes, you're a good boy. You got a candy you can unwrap in a movie theater!I'd name him Sebastian.
27724	Carla	Hey, what's up with the Janitor? He seems a little more lurky than usual.
27725	J.D.	Yeah, I pissed him off earlier today. How am I supposed to avoid him?
27726	Turk	You should put the hide and seek sensor on him. That way you'll always know where he is.
27727	J.D.	It would take a very clever plan to hide this tiny, penny-like sensor on him.
27728	Turk	Five bucks if you eat this penny?
27729	Janitor	Done. And done.
27730	Turk	We pulled it off. See if it works.
27731	J.D.	Mr friend, we have just Lo-Jacked the Janitor. Hello.
27732	Elliot	Dr. Cox, I've got a patient with osteo-myelitis who needs a bone biopsy. Who do you use?
27733	Dr. Cox	You've put me in an awkward spot, because I'm a healer and I want to help, but speaking to you would acknowledge your existence, and you don't exist. So, I'm going to address the stapler. Hi, stapler, the red is killer. By the way, there's a certain Dr. Brownsfield who is just the most wonderful bone guy......what's that? What's that, stapler? Oh no, she's an actual doctor.
27734	Elliot	Neither of you are very funny!
27735	Carla	Elliot, here are you lab results.
27736	Elliot	Oh, my God, Carla...
27737	Carla	Elliot, honey, what's wrong?
27738	Turk	Yeah, Elliot, honey, what's wrong?
27739	Elliot	Nothing, I'm just very emotional, because, um, Keith dumped me. I have to go.
27740	Carla	Another one. Shoot.
27741	Dr. Cox	Keith, I, uh, I've been watching you and you've got some potential. You do, but can I give you one piece of advice?
27742	Keith	Please.
27743	Dr. Cox	It is all about confidence. Hell, be a cocky bastard. Throw 'em a wink every once in a while. Show me a wink. Show me the wink. Give a me a wink.That's the guy. That's the guy who broke our friend's heart.
27744	Carla	Well, hey, he's probably hurting, too.
27745	Dr. Cox	Mmm?
27746	Keith	Hey, baby!
27747	Carla	Oh no, he did not just wink at me. For the next five minutes, I am not a nurse.
27748	Dr. Cox	Uh, no, Carla. There is a better way. I don't like it, but Jordan tells her friends intimate details about me. Our sex lives, my parenting deficiencies, the point is, I'm sure Elliot has told you things about Keith. So instead of yelling at him, why not calmly let him know that you know things that he thinks no-one knows.
27749	Carla	Oh, Keith, mind taking a walk with me?
27750	Keith	Yeah.
27751	Elliot	Is Carla gone?
27752	Dr. Cox	Yeah, she sure is. Say, Barbie.
27753	Elliot	Hmm.
27754	Dr. Cox	We're even.
27755	Elliot	Oh no.
27756	J.D.	All right everybody, before Carla arrives I want to thank you all for turning out, especially you, Father Rosenberg. Incidentally, when all this is over, I'd love to get the back story on that name of yours, OK?Excuse me.OK, coming through. OK, now apparently they don't have fetus balloons. Who knew? So what I've done is attach string to the belly buttons of these baby balloons to signify the umbilical cord. OK, make sure everybody gets one.
27757	Elliot	Keith, you seem to have missed the point here. We're not really broken up.
27758	Keith	I just can't believe you told Carla that I made out with my sister in the sixth grade.
27759	Elliot	Yeah, I don't understand why you're so embarrassed about that. I've met Denise. She's gorgeous.
27760	Turk	We're just going to have to face that fact that you might not get pregnant for a very, very, very long time.
27761	Carla	I know it's going to happen, Turk. And you know what I'm looking forward to the most?
27762	Turk	What's that?
27763	Carla	When we can go around to our friends and tell them one by one I'm pregnant. I can't wait to see the look of surprise on each one of their faces. I think about it every day. Anyone who tries to take those moments away from me, I'll kill them.
27764	Turk	Me too. Just need to send a quick text.
27765	J.D.	Oh no. We got a glitch. Abort the plan! Abort the surprise! Abort the babies!EVERYBODY RUN!Sorry about the whole "abort the babies" thing.
27766	Father Rosenberg	Actually, I'm pro-choice.

27769	Turk	You know what, let me take that from you. Um, you left the fridge open.Aw, I spilled it.
27770	Carla	I'll get another one.
27771	Turk	Sorry.What are you doing?
27772	J.D.	I may have gotten over-excited and told one or two of her family members that she's pregnant.
27773	Answering Machine	You have 59 messages.
27774	Relative	Carla...
27775	Carla	Turk, I think the answering machine is broken. And I don't think we have any more wine. Can I have some of yours?
27776	J.D.'s Narration	I felt like Turk was starting to blame me for all of this.
27777	Turk	I spilled mine, too, honey. You know what you should do? Ask for some of J.D.'s.
27778	J.D.	Spilled mine, too.
27779	Carla	I'm going to bed.
27780	J.D.	What are you going to do?
27781	Turk	I'm gonna go tell her the truth and hope that she's so tired from being pregnant that she doesn't have the strength to kick my ass for more than a few hours.
27782	J.D.	Wait, Turk! I have an idea.
27783	Turk	You have another idea, huh? I gotta tell you, I'm done with your ideas. And not just for now, but forever. OK, are we clear on that?
27784	J.D.	It's a good 'un.
27785	Turk	I'm listening.
27786	J.D.	OK, we need Carla to find out she's pregnant on her own and we need your help. Can we count on you?
27787	Dr. Cox	Absolutely not.
27788	Elliot	No way in hell.
27789	Dr. Kelso	Who's pregnant?
27790	J.D.	If we go down, we're taking you with us.
27791	Dr. Cox	What?
27792	Elliot	Why?
27793	Dr. Kelso	Would someone please tell me who's pregnant?
27794	Turk	Carla.
27795	Dr. Kelso	Another kid? My God, how many does that make?
27796	Turk	This is her first one.
27797	Dr. Kelso	If you say so, son.
27798	Elliot	You can't blackmail us.
27799	J.D.	Really? Because I think you're both very close to Carla, aren't you? And yet you chose not to tell her she was pregnant. Turk how would that go down for them?
27800	Turk	Unpleasantly.
27801	J.D.	Unpleasantly.
27802	Dr. Kelso	Ha. Got you two by the short ones.
27803	Turk	Dr. Kelso, it's true you didn't know anything, but I'm willing to bet that these guys would swear on their life that you did.
27804	Dr. Cox	Definitely.
27805	Elliot	On my life.
27806	J.D.	And I'd enjoy it.
27807	Dr. Kelso	Well played, Turkleton.
27808	Turk	Thank you.
27809	J.D.	OK, listen up. Everyone in the hospital knows Carla's pregnant, but they don't know that she doesn't know. We need her to find out on her own before anyone congratulates her, OK? Here's the plan. The three of us are going to run interference. Dr. Cox, Dr. Kelso, I need you to get her to take another pregnancy test. This plan is foolproof.
27810	Dr. Cox	That's impossible. You two are involved.
27811	Turk	Heh, we'll see about that.
27812	J.D.	You go left.
27813	Turk	OK. That was right.
27814	J.D.	Actually, I need to come with you.
27815	Laverne	Where's Carla?
27816	J.D.	Uh, she went up to the roof to get some air.
27817	Laverne	Oh.
27818	J.D.	Follow her. Lock her up there.
27819	Elliot	You got it.
27820	J.D.	Hello, Janitor, waiting around the corner to grab me.
27821	Janitor	How'd you know that was me?
27822	J.D.	I'm holding a GPS warning device that goes off whenever you come within a hundred meters of me. It's responding to a tiny sensor in your stomach.
27823	Janitor	I knew that wasn't a penny.
27824	J.D.	You'll never get anywhere near me.
27825	Janitor	We'll see.
27826	J.D.	Yeah, we will see.
27827	Janitor	Oh, we're gonna see.
27828	J.D.	The only thing left to do? See.
27829	Janitor	You're going to pay.
27830	J.D.	We'll see.
27831	Janitor	No time.
27832	J.D.	OK, bye.
27833	Turk	Dr. Cox, Dr. Kelso, look who I found.
27834	Dr. Cox	Hey, Carla, you're glowing.
27835	Carla	Really?
27836	Dr. Kelso	Nurse Espinosa, have your breasts gotten bigger?
27837	Carla	Whoa, Dr. Kelso, that is inappropriate.
27838	Turk	Baby, that sounds like a compliment to me. Maybe you're just a little hormonal.
27839	Dr. Cox	Well done, Bob, a little direct, but I think we've definitely put the idea of pregnancy in her head.
27840	Dr. Kelso	Oh, is that what we were doing? I was just making conversation.
27841	Carla	I have been a little moody.
27842	Turk	Yes, you have, baby.
27843	Carla	Plus, this morning I was nauseous, but I thought it was just the pizza rolls I had for breakfast. Yes, I like them, we can get them from now on. Still, Turk, do you think that I should go home and take another pregnancy test?
27844	Turk	It's your call, baby.
27845	Laverne	Hey!! Somebody get me down from here!
27846	Carla	What's she yelling about?
27847	J.D.	I don't know, I'll have someone from the psych ward check her out.
27848	Intern	Hey. Dr. Dorian, I got those batteries you asked for.
27849	J.D.'s Narration	I was a little anxious because it was tie to change Mr. Beeper's batteries. All clear to the left, all clear to the right. You can do this.
27850	Janitor	He's 100 meters away, and it's going to take him at least ten seconds to change those batteries. That's not even a world record pace. Ready, set, go.Time!Still got it.
27851	J.D.'s Narration	As I lay there, watching Nurse Roberts hammer-throw 23 pounds of high end fruit my way, I could take solace in one thing.
27852	Carla	We're having a baby!!
27853	J.D.'s Narration	Any second now, Carla and Turk were coming to tell me they were pregnant. Carla had to believe that I was truly surprised.I was the lynch pin of our plan. Showtime.
27854	Carla	Hey, J.D. We have such big news!
27855	J.D.	What's the scoop? I would have no clue what it could be.
27856	Carla	We're having a baby!
27857	J.D.	Oh!
27858	J.D.'s Thoughts	Now give them the ten minute emotional roller coaster ride that is the speech you've been practicing all afternoon.
27859	J.D.	Carla, when Turk first told me, I
27860	Carla	What do you mean "when Turk first told you?"
27861	J.D.	Oh boy.
27862	Turk	Uh...We've known for a day. That pregnancy test you took yesterday was positive. Yeah, I wanted to have everybody at the hospital gather outside and surprise you with balloons and stuff.
27863	J.D.	What would you have thought of doves?
27864	Turk	J.D., not now. I just wanted to do something really memorable, you know? And I messed that up.
27865	Carla	So everybody already knows?
27866	J.D.'s Narration	Then I witnessed one of those moments that let me know in my heart that these two would be together forever.
27867	Carla	Who cares? We're having a baby. We're having a baby!
27868	J.D.	Yeah, we are.
27869	Carla	A baby! A little you.
27870	Turk	Yeah, but a lot of you.
27871	Carla	It's OK. I already know. I'm pregnant.

27873	J.D.'s Narration	A month ago I shaved my head to show solidarity with a leukemia patient. Of course, there were ramifications.
27874	J.D.	Hello, I'm your doctor.
27875	Krishnas	Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna/ Krishna Krishna Hare Hare...
27876	J.D.	Oh, no no, I know I've got the hair, but I'm not one of you people...Hello, how are you? Well, I have been known to tambour.
27877	Group	Hare Krishna Hare Krishna...
27878	J.D.'s Narration	After our tambourine jam they gave me some literature, but I'm not the type that's easily sucked in by that stuff.
27879	Dr. Mickhead	Good morning, Dr. Dorian.
27880	J.D.	Praise be to Krishna! Dammit.Hey, Mr. Coleman, how are you feeling?
27881	Mr. Coleman	They call me mellow yellow.
27882	J.D.	Um, Mr. Coleman, the hepatitis is doing a number on your liver. You're obviously very jaundiced...yellow! Oh, mellow yellow, I get it, that's funny! You know, I never knew what that song was about. Now I now I finally get it. Liver disease. Anyway, we're going to give you suppressive therapy and do everything we can to make sure you don't need a liver transplant, OK?
27883	Mr. Coleman	OK.
27884	J.D.	All right, see you, Mr. Coleman.
27885	J.D.'s Narration	Unfortunately, a month later...
27886	Mr. Coleman	Let's hear it.
27887	J.D.	Frank, we have no more options. We gotta get you a new liver.
27888	Jordan	So how is the boy toy thing going? I'm thinking of trading Perry in for a younger model.
27889	Elliot	Actually, we're getting kind of serious, so I...
27890	Dr. Cox	Excuse me. I need a moment of silence so I can get into a meditative state where I block out any and all irritating white noise. I call it my happy place.
27891	Elliot	You know, it's kind of rude......well I can understand you haven't had...
27892	Jordan	Uh, sweets, he can't hear you.
27893	Elliot	Really?
27894	Jordan	Mm-mm.
27895	Elliot	I was the one who puked on your Porsche after Turk and Carla's wedding.Ugh, that has been eating at me for two years. Anyway, Keith is great, the only thing is his last name is um...Dudemeister.
27896	Jordan	Oh, that doesn't even sound real.
27897	Elliot	Well, it's actually German, Dudemeister means master of dudes.
27898	Jordan	You know, one of the reasons I divorced Perry was because of his last name.
27899	Elliot	You don't like Cox?
27900	Jordan	Actually, I love Cox.
27901	Todd	Greatest conversation ever.
27902	Jordan	See, that's the problem.
27903	Female	This sausage is huge!
27904	Todd	Excuse me, ladies. I'm needed elsewhere.
27905	Jordan	You know what? the four of us should go out for drinks sometime.
27906	Elliot	Actually, we're free tonight.
27907	Jordan	It's a couple date!
27908	Elliot	Done!
27909	Dr. Cox	Something horrible just happened.
27910	J.D.	All right, buddy. Today's the day.
27911	J.D.'s Narration	The amazing thing about livers is that a healthy person can actually have part of it removed and give it to somebody else. For Frank, that person was his brother, Marc.
27912	Marc	Hey, somebody order a liver? Ha ha ha! Uh oh. Jello? Jello? Is this thing on?
27913	J.D.'s Narration	Marc was a stand-up comic on a cruise ship.
27914	Marc	If I'm not careful, they'll put me in the pun-itentiary.
27915	J.D.'s Narration	He was a genius.
27916	Mr. Coleman	Thanks for doing this for me, man.
27917	Marc	Hey, what's mine is yours, little bro. You know that.
27918	Turk	I didn't get that one.
27919	J.D.	I didn't either. Hey, Turk, if you ever donated a body part to me, you know which one I'd want?Hey, thanks for the butt, playa!
27920	Carla	You better have a reason for taking my man's badonka-donk donk.
27921	J.D.	I do, Carla. I'm building something.
27922	Elliot	What?
27923	J.D.	A brick house!
27924	Laverne	Dr. Turk? Todd needs you in the lab.
27925	Turk	Tell Todd he can kiss my big, black ass. Bet you wish you could say that.
27926	J.D.	I do.
27927	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
27928	Marc	Brr. These gowns do not protect the fellows against a cool breeze, do they?
27929	Mr. Coleman	You'll get used to it.
27930	Turk	OK, we'll be back to check on you guys a little later, all right?
27931	Marc	OK, we'll be the guys that look like us.
27932	Turk	How does he come up with this stuff?
27933	J.D.	You know, you could be a dynamite center square.
27934	Turk	Dude, four more hours and I am off.
27935	J.D.	You mean we are off. I changed my schedule which means I have Thursday nights off which means we are going out which means you are going to be my wingman. Even though you're horrible at it.
27936	Turk	When have I been a bad wingman?
27937	J.D.	Turk, are you sure this isn't offensive? It doesn't look like anybody else is wearing a costume.
27938	Turk	Buddy, relax. These are my guys, all right? As long as you're with me, they're going to find this funny.
27939	J.D.	All right.
27940	Turk	That looks like Talia.
27941	J.D.	Wazzup!Waaaah!!
27942	Turk	My bad, my bad.
27943	J.D.	Wooo! Ahh!
27944	Turk	That that wasn't Talia.
27945	J.D.	Every time I saw them they yelled out "cracker." How did they know I love crackers?
27946	Dr. Cox	Please don't make me go out with Barbie, and yes, I know it's too easy, Ken.
27947	Jordan	But we haven't gone out with another couple in over a year.
27948	Dr. Cox	Jordan, there's a reason for that.
27949	Dr. Zeltzer	Wh-wh-whoa, slow down there, big guy.
27950	Dr. Cox	Why, Zeltzer? It's not like I'm driving.
27951	Dr. Zeltzer	I know, but there was a roofie in it.
27952	Jordan	I'm not sure if I'm OK with that.
27953	Dr. Zeltzer	Three, two, one.
27954	Dr. Zeltzer's wife	Party time.
27955	Jordan	I think we should give them another chance.
27956	Carla	Whoa!
27957	Dr. Kelso	Nurse Espinosa, I need your help with something. My dog, Baxter, passed away last night. I dealt with it emotionally, but unfortunately, I can't stop crying. Anyway, I need you to run interference for me today. Keep people from seeing me looking vulnerable and so forth.
27958	Carla	So you think I'll automatically do this? You think my ego is so big that I'll be flattered that I'm the only one you can open up to? I'll do it.
27959	Marc	Wish us luck guys!
27960	J.D.	Good luck fellas.
27961	Dr. Cox	All the best.
27962	J.D.	We'll be rooting for you.
27963	Turk	Good luck.
27964	J.D.	And I will see you later.
27965	Turk	Wonderful.
27966	Dr. Cox	What are you two gonna do? Stay up late, eat raw cookie dough and pinky-swear that you're diet will start tomorrow?
27967	Turk	What is your problem?
27968	Dr. Cox	Ah, Jordan is forcing me to double-date with the Dudemeisters.
27969	Turk	Because of J.D., I gotta miss Turk Night. Yeah, I only have three nights off during the week. Two of nights Carla has off two, so we gotta do married stuff.
27970	Dr. Cox	Fighting, arguing, bickering and the occasional quickie?
27971	Turk	Exactly. But Thursday nights, I got the apartment to myself. So you know, I come home...
27972	Turk's Voiceover	I open the door. I immediately get comfortable. Then I take care of all my busy work. Case dictation, patient charts, everything.Then I watch whatever's on ESPN.
27973	TV Announcer	Stay tuned for more Gilmore Girls!
27974	Turk	Mothers and daughters. They speak so fast, but they speak so true.
27975	Turk's Voiceover	I make some important work calls.
27976	Turk	Did you see it?
27977	J.D.	I am so mad at Lorelei I can't even talk right now.
27978	Turk	That's Turk Night.
27979	Dr. Cox	God, you're boring.
27980	Elliot	Hey, just need to talk to Kelso.
27981	Carla	You can't come in.
27982	Elliot	Why?
27983	Dr. Kelso	I have no pants on.
27984	Carla	He spilled coffee on them. I wish I didn't have to see those pale legs.]
27985	Elliot	Ask him if we can get a new label-maker in the pharmacy. The "P" is broken and nobody knows what "enicillin" is.
27986	Carla	Oh. Sir, she just wants...
27987	Dr. Kelso	Just tell her no!
27988	Carla	But, sir, she just...
27989	Dr. Kelso	If it makes you feel better, you can pretend you're fighting for her. Yell "hear me out, Bob."
27990	Carla	Hear me out, you old jackass!
27991	Dr. Kelso	No ad-libbing! Now send her packing.
27992	Carla	He said yes.
27993	Elliot	Coolio!
27994	Dr. Kelso	You think you're funny. My job is to spend the day saying "no" to people. And now that you have let a "yes" spread out into the world, you have opened the floodgates.
27995	Laverne	Can we have bibles in the patients' rooms?
27996	Carla	No.
27997	Ted	Can I get a better hands-free headset for my phone?
27998	Carla	No.
27999	Todd	Can I be allowed back in the men's locker room?
28000	Carla	No!
28001	Janitor	Can I get some new work boots?
28002	Carla	No.
28003	Janitor	Guess the old ones still work. I do have more requests though. I need an anvil, some barbed wire and a bow and arrow.
28004	Carla	No.
28005	Janitor	Hm. How about a sled dog?
28006	Carla	No.
28007	Janitor	Cowboy hat?
28008	Carla	No.
28009	Janitor	Ferris wheel?
28010	Carla	No.
28011	Janitor	Stun gun?
28012	Carla	No.
28013	Janitor	Pelican?
28014	Carla	No!
28015	Dr. Kelso	I'll be on the couch, napping.
28016	Jordan	Sweetie, calm down. If you're miserable, you can just talk to me. I won't abandon you, all right?Hey! Oh my God...
28017	Elliot	...I love your jacket...
28018	Jordan	...I love your necklace...
28019	Keith	Hey, uh, Dr. Cox, can you get me beer? I forgot my ID.
28020	Dr. Cox	Ohh..
28021	Turk	I can't believe people hang out at bowling alleys now.
28022	J.D.	It's great. You surround yourself with some new friends. You say one clever thing and you're in. Watch this. You guys, let's tally it up, gather round! Whoa, Carol! 180, amazing! Lisa, you had a 125. Turk, 192!
28023	Turk	That's how we do!
28024	J.D.	And bowled a gentleman's 40. Now, who wants to help me off with my shoes? I forgot to wear socks.I'm losing them.
28025	Turk	If you ladies remain in this area, we'll bring back drinks.
28026	J.D.	Nice save.Krishnas.
28027	Turk	Relax, they'll never recognize you.
28028	Fraternity Brother	Good to see you again.
28029	J.D.	Wazzup?
28030	Elliot	I hate it when Keith wears that shirt. We get it. You like sports.
28031	Jordan	Sweetie, you have to dress your man. For God's sake, Perry walked out of the house tonight in a hockey jersey.
28032	Keith	Dr. Cox, when you first st
28033	Jordan	Hey you! Make an effort!
28034	Dr. Cox	Ah. You may tell me who your favorite sports team is. Keep it short.
28035	Keith	Detroit Red Wings.
28036	Dr. Cox	Oh.For the next twenty minutes, you will sit in silence while I tell you why the Detroit Red Wings are the greatest franchise in the history of professional sports. On September 25, 1926...
28037	J.D.	Look at you, man, you're color's back, there's no sign of infection.
28038	Mr. Coleman	I feel I feel great.
28039	J.D.	You look great, man, I'm glad.
28040	Mr. Coleman	Thanks.
28041	J.D.'s Narration	Unfortunately, things weren't going as well for Marc.
28042	Laverne	He's hypertensive and tachycardic.
28043	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes that's the way life works. The ones who do the nice things suffer the most. Whether it's giving up Turk Night for a friend...
28044	Dr. Wen	Christopher, why haven't you finished your case reports?
28045	Turk	Sorry, Dr. Wen, I was going to do them last night, but I wound up going out with my buddy, right?
28046	Dr. Wen	Just get them done.
28047	J.D.'s Narration	...Or going out with an intern to make your wife happy...
28048	Leslie	Hey, Dr. Cox, we're going coffee, you want to come?
28049	Dr. Cox	Get get the hell away from me.Why are you all smiling?
28050	Leslie	Keith said you'd be mean. But then you'd tell us sports stories.
28051	Dr. Cox	Oh my God.
28052	J.D.'s Narration	...or agreeing to be the bad guy for your boss.
28053	Carla	Hi!Oh, come on!
28054	J.D.'s Narration	When you're the one paying the price it can really make you wonder...
28055	J.D.	He's bleeding out. Prep the OR. CAN I HAVE THE CRASH CART IN HERE!!
28056	J.D.'s Narration	...was it worth it?
28057	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
28058	Turk	So one of the ligation sutures came undone, but we got it in time. He should be fine now.
28059	J.D.	OK, Nurse Winston, call me if there's any change.Dude, how awesome was last night?
28060	Turk	Dude, you got bowled by my frat brothers.
28061	J.D.	No, man, we're all cool now. They even invited me to this alumni thing they're having in January.
28062	Turk	The Martin Luther King Fling?
28063	J.D.	Sounds hot. Hey, we're going out Thursday, right? Because I went online and got a magic eight-ball bowling ball. Check this: Are the ladies going to love this? "Ask again later?" Oh, I'm just kidding, it says yes.
28064	Turk	You know what? Thursday night might not work for me.
28065	J.D.	You're going. Where are the interns?
28066	Turk	They're with Dr. Cox. Apparently he's mentoring them and talking to them and stuff.
28067	J.D.'s Thoughts	What?!
28068	Dr. Cox	OK, that's it! This right here is the "get hit line." Cross it at your own risk.
28069	Leslie	When do you turn nice? This is getting kind of old.
28070	Dr. Cox	Never, Leslie.
28071	Leslie	He knows my name!
28072	Dr. Cox	I was just calling you by a random girl's name. Listen, please, I don't care about any of your problems. I have no answers for any of you.
28073	Gloria	But my boyfriend is bi-curious and he wants me to pick his lovers.
28074	Dr. Cox	I might have an answer for that: Ew. I mean come on, children, what do you actually think is going to happen here? Do you think I'm going to take you and sit you down next to me and say, uh, "listen, um, if you need anything......you've got my pager. Just know that I'm there for you, always."
28075	J.D.	Oh. My. God.
28076	Dr. Cox	Newbie...
28077	J.D.	No! Zip it! I am so G-darn pissed right now. I was OK when you kept me at an arm's length because everybody said "that's just Cox. That's how he operates." And I believed them. Now I walk in on this. This bi-racial love fest? You know what? I hate to do it, but I'm giving you back the pencil. That's right. The pencil you gave me on my third day of work. You handed it off to me like a like a tiny yellow baton. Like you were trying to say to me "J.D., you are the new me. You, J.D., are my mentee. You are my son."
28078	Dr. Cox	What pencil?
28079	J.D.	Oh, that's perfect.That's perfect. You know what, take it!Maybe you can use it with Rex, or Gloria, or that guy.
28080	Dr. Cox	That guy's name is Leslie.
28081	J.D.	Heh. His name is Leslie. His name is Leslie. You're name is Leslie. All right, good for you, Leslie.LESLIE!
28082	Carla	So do you think everyone's still mad at me?
28083	Elliot	Oh, I'm...
28084	Janitor	Guys, come on, I'm the only one giving the evil eye. We worked on this. Hey, Ted, you're giving sad eye.
28085	Ted	It's all I've got!
28086	Janitor	I don't believe that. Now come on. Let's suck it up. Dig deep, concentrate and just...And break. Nice. Very nice, guys, even you.
28087	Todd	I just thought about flat boobies and it made me mad.
28088	Carla	What do I have to do to make it up to you?
28089	Laverne	Go, Ted.
28090	Ted	We want tickets to the Latin Grammys. We figure you might know someone.
28091	Carla	I don't.
28092	Elliot	Oh, Carla, please...
28093	Carla	Elliot! I don't.
28094	Elliot	How about she just buys rounds for everyone at the bar?
28095	Laverne	Martinis, cool.
28096	Ted	Aww.
28097	Todd	Oh, OK, see you, guys.
28098	Carla	That was easy, hm?
28099	Janitor	Latin Grammys o nada.
28100	Carla	A bunch of interns are looking for you.
28101	Dr. Cox	I know. I'm in my streets because I'm sneaking out of here early. All because of Jordan and her stupid couples' night.
28102	Dr. Zeltzer	Oh, Perry, speaking of couples nights, I don't know if you and Jordan like camping, but this weekend, me and the wife, and a pretty interesting guy named Ron are heading out to the lake.
28103	Dr. Cox	Keep moving, Zeltzer.
28104	Dr. Zeltzer	Rain check.
28105	Carla	So, you gotta leave early. Thanks to Kelso, I gotta take half the hospital staff out for drinks so they don't hate me.
28106	Turk	Thanks to J.D. I'll be up forever doing these damn case reports. Plus, I lost the one night a week that I look forward to.
28107	Carla	What about the two nights a week we spend together?
28108	Turk	Now I am *so* mad at J.D.
28109	Dr. Cox	That's it. We gotta let these people know what they're putting us through.
28110	Carla	Let's do this.
28111	Turk	Let's do it.
28112	Jordan	I like this particular outfit because it's casual and the pant pockets are extra deep which is perfect for storing makeup.
28113	Elliot	He's like a giant purse!
28114	Jordan	Ah!
28115	Keith	This shirt is itchy.
28116	Jordan	Oh, oh, ssh-ssh. Purses don't talk.
28117	Dr. Cox	Jordan, you promised this would never happen.
28118	J.D.	How dare you!
28119	Dr. Cox	Could we talk?
28120	Jordan	One sec. I just wanted to thank you for the other night. Since Perry and I had Jack, we don't get to go out that much as a couple and it was really nice. Don't tell anyone I'm nice.
28121	Elliot	Oh, Mm. No.
28122	Carla	Dr. Kelso, we need to talk.
28123	Dr. Kelso	Baxter was a good dog. You never think you're going to miss animals as much as you do. It was just nice having some creature in my life who never disappointed me. Never judged me. Never showed up late at my 50th birthday party with freshly pierced nipples and a barely-legal Filipino boy named Pogo. My son Harrison.
28124	Carla	I figured.
28125	Dr. Kelso	Man's best friend, huh? They got that one right.
28126	Carla	At least you stopped crying.
28127	Dr. Kelso	Oh, not really. My body can't produce tears anymore because I've intentionally dehydrated myself. It's a risky move, I know, but Dr. Jarvis here said it'll be all right.
28128	Carla	There's nobody standing behind you.
28129	Dr. Kelso	I'm going to need an IV.
28130	Turk	J.D. Can I talk to you?
28131	J.D.	I can't right now, I gotta go check on Frank.
28132	Turk	So, you missing the other half of you liver?
28133	Marc	Oh, I'm not. But my gall bladder's pretty broken up about it. Apparently they had a thing.
28134	Turk	You got a gift, man, a gift! Did your brother freak out when you told him you almost died?
28135	Marc	Oh, I didn't tell Frank. Look at him. He's so happy. If he knew what I went through, he'd feel terrible. Why would I want to do that to him when I love him so much?
28136	J.D.	Hey, Turk, you wanted to talk to me?
28137	Jordan	You wanted to talk to me?
28138	Dr. Kelso	You wanted to talk to me?
28139	Keith	Dr. Cox, can we talk about something besides sports this time?
28140	Dr. Cox	Uhh...
28141	Carla	You're OK.
28142	Dr. Cox	OK, uh, Keith, you may choose between good scotch, ab workouts or Lee Marvin movies.
28143	Carla	And who over here needs a refill?
28144	Todd	Yes, please.
28145	Laverne	Thanks for the 'tini, Carla.
28146	Carla	You got it, mama.Here you go, grumpy.
28147	Janitor	Latin Grammys!
28148	Carla	I can tell you the nominees?
28149	Janitor	Rapidoso.
28150	Carla	Category?
28151	Janitor	Uh, reggaeton.
28152	J.D.	I'm having a great time, man.
28153	Turk	Me too.
28154	J.D.	Cheers.
28155	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
28156	Carla	Ohh, what a cutie. Where did this little guy come from?
28157	J.D.	Doug found him in some dead guy's colon.
28158	Carla	Plagh!
28159	J.D.	Hey little guy. Doug's still pretty upset about the whole thing.
28160	Doug	Why would he live in there?
28161	Turk	Diseased rodent should be nowhere near my pregnant princess.
28162	J.D.'s Narration	Carla being pregnant had changed everyone. It made Dr. Kelso softer.
28163	Dr. Kelso	Ahh, I think the children in pediatrics would love this little fella. Ha ha!
28164	J.D.'s Narration	Carla's pregnancy also affected Elliot.
28165	Elliot	OK, so we're both off in a few minutes. Here's what's going to happen. We're heading back to my place.
28166	Keith	Oh, yeah?
28167	Elliot	I'm going to put on something very naughty.
28168	Keith	Awesome.
28169	Elliot	And then we're going to have sex and pretend that we aren't using protection and that we're trying to make a baby.
28170	Keith	Un-awesome.
28171	Elliot	Keith, we're doing this. I need it.
28172	J.D.'s Narration	As for me, I bought a custom-made Italian suit.
28173	J.D.	Eh? What do you think? I had it made for the christening. That little mixed-race embryo got a godfather yet?
28174	Turk	J.D., that's something we have to discuss as a couple.
28175	Carla	You know what, I'm not sure that suit works on you.
28176	J.D.	Thanks for your opinion, Carla. But I'm much more interested in what you all think.
28177	Lonnie	We don't love it.
28178	J.D.	Well, who cares, Lonnie. Because all that really matters is whether or not America loves it.
28179	Americo	For the last time, it's Americo. And of course I love it. I made it!
28180	J.D.	He's a dynamite tailor. Not sure why he's here.
28181	Carla	You better put your scrubs on, Herbert's back.
28182	J.D.	How you doing, buddy?
28183	J.D.'s Narration	Because of his weight, Herbert was a frequent visitor and no one liked treating him.He wasn't a mean thing. See, with big people, even the simple stuff is more difficult. I didn't mind, because Herbie was my man.
28184	J.D.	How you feeling, love bug?
28185	Herbert	Fully loaded. Hey, it's time for my sponge bath, right? I need three girls...
28186	J.D.	Herbie, it's not a bath house.We'll get those bandages off later today, Mr. Brooks, all right
28187	Mr. Brooks	Mmhmm.
28188	Dr. Cox	OK, as you all know, Sacred Heart is dealing with a mountain of malpractice lawsuits, courtesy of bumbling interns, clueless doctors and hack surgeons, or as like to refer to them, you people. Now since Sweaty Teddy here backs up his infinitesimal knowledge of the law with absolutely zero knowledge of medicine, one of you is going to have to help him go through the claims, decipher the medical stuff and somehow relay all of that into his tiny, peanut brain. Ted, how many times did I insult you during that speech? I was shooting for five.
28189	Ted	Only three unless you count "Sweaty Teddy" as an insult, but my mom calls me that and she loves me, right?
28190	Dr. Cox	No, Ted, she hates you. Four. Now since Ted has no life, and that's five, I'm going to let him hand-select his very own victim. Ted?
28191	Ted	I'll take Claire!
28192	Claire	Oh, God.
28193	Ted	You turned me down fourteen times for drinks. Well, who's the creepy loser now, huh?
28194	J.D.'s Narration	And just like that, I had the chance to comfort Claire.
28195	J.D.	You look like you need to be rescued.
28196	J.D.'s Narration	Life was good, but then came a surprise visit from my brother, and a round of the game he likes to call "Watch her leave."
28197	Dan	There's no easy way to say this. We've got the crabs.Oh, she was cute.
28198	J.D.	Yes, she was, Dan. Thank you. We'll be right back.
28199	Patient	Was he talking to us?
28200	Carla	Don't know, don't care. Here, take this.
28201	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
28202	J.D.	So, Dan. To what do we owe this...something?
28203	Dan	I had to blow out of town. Mom doinked her new boyfriend and then goaded him into getting me a job interview where he works. Yuhh.
28204	J.D.	Well, you know, Mom does what she has to do.
28205	Dan	What do I need with a full time job? I got a sweet setup and home, I got this sweet bed up in Mom's attic, I'm driving Dad's old Plymouth Horizon, rest his soul, and because I'm the senior bartender at K-Diggs, I get to take home half the extra chicken wings, thank you.
28206	Dr. Cox	Dan, do you ever have to pinch yourself to make sure it's not all some crazy dream?
28207	Dan	That does not count as a formal hello, Coxsmith.
28208	J.D.	Don't call him Coxsmith.
28209	Dan	I call him Coxsmith.
28210	J.D.	Well, OK.
28211	Dan	So what's new around here?
28212	Turk	Carla's pregnant.
28213	Dan	Dude, bummer.
28214	Turk	No, we're trying to have kids.
28215	Dan	Oh, congratulations. That's great. Not really a big kid person. Are you guys totally, uh, freaking out?
28216	Carla & Turk	Nah...
28217	J.D.'s Narration	And they weren't. They were taking it all in stride.
28218	Carla	OK, here's how I think we should name our baby. It's what my parents did. If it's a girl, I get to pick the name. If it's a boy, you pick the name.
28219	Turk	OK.
28220	Carla	I like "Angie" for a girl.
28221	Turk	And if it's a boy, say hello to Fu'Kwan! Wassup!
28222	Carla	OK, you know what? I think we should pick the names together.
28223	Turk	OK. Because I was thinking, you know, for a girl...
28224	Carla	Sweetie, we already have a girl's name. And for a boy, why not name him after your cousin?
28225	Turk	Tiger?
28226	Carla	Turk, I'm begging you to stop telling people that, no one believes you.
28227	Turk	Well tell that to the last two women I slept with before you, OK? Sha-boing. Boing.Oh, God.
28228	Carla	I'm talking about your other cousin, George.
28229	Turk	I like that.
28230	Carla	Yeah.
28231	Turk	George and Angie, all right.
28232	Carla	Oh, and if you mention the names to anyone, they'll ruin them for us, so don't tell anyone, OK? No one.
28233	J.D.	What's up my negro amigo?
28234	Turk	Nothing.
28235	J.D.	Hey, I paged you because I can't figure out what's going on with Herbert. He's got acute back pain and no cauda equina signs.
28236	Turk	If we have a girl, we're gonna name her Angie.
28237	Dan	Hey, Chris. If there was a test to see of your baby was gay would you do it?
28238	Carla	Oh, sweetie, he's...
28239	Turk	Extremely, yes. And I'm OK with it.)
28240	Dan	Anyway, Elliot wasn't in the lab.
28241	Turk	Oh, she's at home.
28242	J.D.	Oh, you know what, I'll be done in a couple of seconds. We'll find her.
28243	Dan	OK. Hi, Herbert.
28244	Herbert	Keep it cool, man.
28245	Dan	Dan train. Woo woo!
28246	J.D.	Thanks a lot, dude.
28247	Turk	What?
28248	J.D.	That Dan train used to hook up with Elliot.
28249	Turk	So?
28250	Herbert	So? Man, your boy J.D.'s been telling him that Elliot still likes him.
28251	J.D.	Doctor-patient confidentiality goes both ways, Mr. I-Prefer-My-Temperature-Taken-Through-the-Back-Door.
28252	Herbert	What? I mean it tickles.
28253	J.D.	Look, Dan doesn't exactly have the world by the tail, OK? Every time he calls me all depressed, the only thing I can think of to cheer him up was to say "Elliot still digs you." I'm just trying to find a way to make him feel good about himself, you know?
28254	Turk	If we have a boy, we're gonna name him George.
28255	J.D.	What about Tiger?
28256	Herbert	Hey, man, where'd your brother go, anyway?
28257	J.D.	Oh boy.Call Elliot...call Elliot...No. N Call Elliot...got her...
28258	Elliot	We don't want any distractions while we're trying to make a baby.
28259	Keith	OK, you gotta stop saying that.
28260	Elliot	Keith, we're role-playing, all-right? This is not real, now let's just do this!
28261	Keith	All right.
28262	Elliot	Promise me you'll hold me like this when I'm pushing your baby out my bajingo?
28263	Keith	All right, I'm putting on a third condom.
28264	Elliot	Keith!What?!No, J.D., I'm not going to act like I want to bone your brother, I'm telling him the truth.
28265	Dan	Hey, Elliot's wearing lingerie.
28266	Elliot	Hey, Dan, J.D. told me you were coming. Um, this is Keith. I'm sure you're a little disappointed.
28267	Dan	Yeah, I'm in. I go first.
28268	Elliot	Yeah b- um...
28269	Keith	Elliot, you have to ask me about things like this.
28270	Elliot	And that is the father of my fake baby.
28271	Jordan	Ugh. I gotta go down to Jack's preschool. Apparently Seymour was teasing him, so he punched him in the face.
28272	Dr. Cox	Do Seymour's parents have to go down there?
28273	Jordan	I doubt it. They're turtles.
28274	Dr. Kelso	Count yourself lucky. My son just sent me a picture of himself sitting on the lap of his new boyfriend, Winston.
28275	Dr. Cox & Jordan	Huh.
28276	Jordan	Why are they dressed up as Tonto and the Lone Ranger?
28277	Dr. Kelso	Well I'd like to tell you they're going to a costume party, but apparently those are their jammies.
28278	Dr. Cox	Come on, look on the bright side. He is like the daughter that you never had, only gay and unsuccessful.
28279	Dr. Kelso	Ha! Tell me about it!
28280	Dr. Cox	It's so funny the way kids are, isn't it? Ha ha ha! You never know how it's going to go.
28281	J.D.'s Narration	Now that Dan knew that Elliot wasn't in to him, my focus had shifted from keeping him away from her, to avoiding him so he doesn't kill me.
28282	J.D.	Hey, Mr. Brooks, let's get these bandages off you.What are you doing here?
28283	Janitor	Mr. Brooks wanted some safety tips on how to safely operate propane heaters.
28284	J.D.	As long as you're not my brother.
28285	Janitor	I had a brother once. Well, I shouldn't say once, he's still my brother. My parents adopted him when I was about 12. He was about 46. Actually older than my parents. His name was Cleat. And he talked like this. Howsitgoin? Howsitgoin? Good kid. Did what they said. Make the bed, mop the floor, sweep the lawn, whatever had to be done. Everything was good till he was in his fifties, and then, wow, did he have a midlife crisis. Him and my dad fought constantly. And I mean, really, physically beating on each other. But I don't blame him for it though. I blame my mom for sleeping with him. That's just out of line.
28286	J.D.	Yeah.
28287	Janitor	Anyway, the reason I'm telling you this is because your brother told me that if I could keep you focused on me, he would let me watch.
28288	J.D.	Watch what?
28289	Dan	Hey, little brother.
28290	J.D.	WAAAAHHH!!
28291	Carla	I can't believe those kids are playing with that dead guy's butt hamster.
28292	Turk	That is disgusting.
28293	Girl	It's my turn to hold Angie.
28294	Carla	What did she call that thing?
28295	Turk	Uh, baby, we should go.
28296	Carla	Ah-ah... Where did you come up with that name?
28297	J.D.	I guess I could help you name her. Let's see. It's a girl hamster, what about Angie?
28298	Girl	I love it!
28299	J.D.	Me too. Angie, guys?
28300	Kids	Yeah!
28301	J.D.	Angie it is.
28302	Turk	Hold his arms!
28303	J.D.	Wait, Turk, it was an accident, OK? The name just popped into my head!
28304	Turk	Shut up!! You just shut up right now! Pink belly.
28305	J.D.	No! Turk!
28306	J.D.'s Narration	Unfortunately, Turk was the greatest pink-bellyer in all the land.
28307	Dr. Cox	You know, Bobbo, I find you less repugnant as of late. Dare I say, I'm developing a begrudging indifference to you.
28308	Dr. Kelso	Ah, Perry, you're so edgy and cantakerous, you're like House without the limp.
28309	Dr. Cox	Ohh...
28310	Dr. Kelso	Ted, I've decided this project is over the head of the that pretty little lady, there, so Dr. Cox will replacing her.
28311	Claire	That was the longest three hours of my life.
28312	Ted	Call me!Tell you what she's not good at. Staring contests.
28313	Dr. Cox	Why, Bob?
28314	Dr. Kelso	Why the hell not?
28315	J.D.	So, Herbert, how you doing with your diet, man?
28316	Herbert	The best I could do, man. How's your tummy?
28317	J.D.	Uh, Turk was so proud of his handiwork that he signed it.I think he knows it's so painful I won't be able to wash it for some time.
28318	Herbert	Hey, man, y'all two OK?
28319	J.D.'s Narration	Actually, we were. Because the way the whole brother thing works, now that Dan had beaten me up, it was all over.
28320	Dan	WHY DID YOU LIE TO ME ABOUT ELLIOT?!
28321	J.D.'s Narration	Or not.
28322	J.D.	Oh, come on, man, a girl like Elliot could never be into somebody like you.
28323	Dan	Why wouldn't she be into me?
28324	J.D.'s Narration	The obvious response was that Elliot was looking for a guy with more going on in his life. And the only way to gently break that to my brother was this:
28325	J.D.	Elliot wants to have kids right now, and she knows you're not ready.
28326	Dan	Ohhhhh...bummer.
28327	Herbert	Hey, man, don't worry about it, man, he bought it. It's cool.
28328	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
28329	J.D.'s Narration	I have to Elliot before my brother, Dan, does.
28330	Elliot	Herbert, I'm afraid your back pain might involve your spinal cord, so we need to get you an MRI. Now where is my pen?
28331	J.D.	Elliot! Elliot!
28332	Elliot	'Sup, J.D.?
28333	J.D.	My brother is on his way up. You have to tell him that the only reason you don't want to be with him is because he doesn't want kids right now.
28334	Elliot	J.D., just tell him the truth.
28335	J.D.	Elliot, the last time I was honest with Dan about his life it just made him feel like crap. And he didn't talk to me again until our dad died. Do you really want me to do that? Because I'm not sure what would get us back together this time. Dad can't die again.
28336	Dan	What's going on, guys?
28337	Dr. Cox	I am not having a staring contest with you, Ted.
28338	Ted	OK, one-nothing me, oh yeah. Yeah. OK, back to work. OK, this next patient claims their s-s-stent was implanted incorrectly. What's a stent?
28339	Dr. Cox	A tube that holds arteries open.
28340	Ted	All right. And, what's a Buckland?
28341	Dr. Cox	It's a predominantly hairless growth that is never found on women.
28342	Ted	Weird.
28343	Dr. Cox	It's your last name, Ted.
28344	Ted	Good one.
28345	Dan	So, uh, you got the baby fever, huh?
28346	Elliot	Yup, heh. Hopefully I'm already pregnant with Keith's child.
28347	Keith	Oh, come on! I'm 25 and I haven't even been to Europe!
28348	Elliot	Keith, wait!
28349	Dan	I got a good feeling about those two. Well, I'm off.
28350	J.D.	All right, man. Say hi to Mom for me.
28351	Dan	Yup. Get my stuff.
28352	J.D.'s Narration	And like that, he was gone.
28353	Turk	You know what name I've always liked for a girl? Honor.
28354	Carla	Turk, you know how mean boys are. They'd be all like "I got Honor, did you get Honor?"
28355	Turk	Yeah, everybody got Honor. She's easy.
28356	Carla	It's your daughter.
28357	Turk	Yes, it is.
28358	Carla	It's just weird. Angie was perfect, now nothing seems as good.
28359	Turk	What you got there, sir?
28360	Dr. Kelso	Dead hamster.
28361	Turk	Angie's dead? Baby, we got our name back!
28362	Carla	Yeah!
28363	Turk	Uh-huh!
28364	Janitor	Sir, if no one's officially called dibs?
28365	Dr. Kelso	Take it, freak.
28366	Janitor	What? I'm making a hamster vest for one of my squirrels.
28367	Jordan	What's going on?
28368	Ted	I love you too, dumpling, but I have to work late. I'll make it up to you this weekend.
28369	Dr. Cox	Ted's on the phone with his mom, so we're taking a five. Why? Why is Kelso doing this to me?
28370	Jordan	You know.
28371	Dr. Cox	No, I don't. All I remember is we were both making fun of our kids, and bam, he stuck me with Ted.
28372	Jordan	No, no. You made fun of your kid, he made fun of his kid, and then you made fun of *his kid.* Don't you get it?You can never say bad things about someone else's kid. Ever.
28373	Ted	Mmm, if you can't reach that spot with the lotion, I'll get it for you when I get home late tonight. OK, kisses.You ready to get back in there?
28374	Dr. Cox	Yeah. I gotta vomit first.
28375	J.D.	OK, guys, let's all gather round, huddle up. Now, you guys, Herbert in there needs an MRI, but he won't fit into our machine. Does anybody know what we should do?
28376	J.D.'s Narration	Nobody wanted to say it, but sometimes when hospitals have Herbert-sized patients they'll send them to the one place that has MRI machines big enough: the zoo.
28377	J.D.	I know what you're all thinking, but I'm not going to do that to Herbert, it's too humiliating.
28378	Elliot	Herbert, you're too big for our MRI machine, so we're gonna have to take you to the zoo.
28379	Herbert	Damn. Well, that sucks.
28380	Elliot	You kinda brought this on yourself, didn't you?
28381	Herbert	Damn.
28382	J.D.	Why do you hate Herbert?
28383	Elliot	He's been in here seven times, all for weight related problems. I mean, he's never even tried to get healthier. Sometimes protecting someone's feelings isn't the best way to go.
28384	J.D.	Spare me the tough love speech, all right? You really think that going in there and being mean to Herbert is going to cause him to turn his life around and lose 100 pounds?
28385	Elliot	Probably not, but as long as I'm still in there trying to get him to change, then I can sleep at night. When you think about your brother later, how are you going to sleep?
28386	Carla	Angie and George.
28387	Turk	Mmm.
28388	Carla	Wow.
28389	Turk	You know what's weird?
28390	Carla	Hmm?
28391	Turk	Now that they have names, everything seems so real. I can see George's smile. And I can see Angie having your curly hair.
28392	Carla	I hope she doesn't have my ear infections.I was really sick as a baby.
28393	Turk	I was a climber. Our windows don't have bars on them. If George gets up there, he's falling right into the alley.
28394	Carla	What if George doesn't love me?
28395	Turk	What if Angie stops breathing in her sleep?Why did we have to pick these stupid names? I hate it when things get real!
28396	Carla	You know, when I was in high school, I had a shop teacher named George who hated black people.
28397	Turk	There was a prostitute at my town mall. Her name was Angie.
28398	Carla	Great, well, those names are out.
28399	Turk	Yeah, they're out!
28400	Carla	And we don't need new ones!
28401	Turk	We don't need new ones for nine months! I'm ready for bed.
28402	Carla	Me too.
28403	Turk	OK.
28404	Dr. Cox	Hey, Bob. You got a minute?
28405	Dr. Kelso	If you killed Ted, I don't want to know about it. Just make sure it's not traceable to the hospital.
28406	Dr. Cox	That's not why I'm here, but it's good to know. Look, uh, I just wanted to apologize for what I said about your son.
28407	Dr. Kelso	Well, he hasn't turned out exactly as I'd planned. For example, I always imagined we'd spend his thirteenth birthday fly-fishing in Montana.
28408	Dr. Cox	Where did you spend it?
28409	Dr. Kelso	On 42nd street, camped out for eight misbehaving tickets. He's a good kid though.
28410	Dr. Cox	Tell me about him.
28411	Dr. Kelso	He is a good kid. He's always been a good kid. And the first time I knew we weren't on the same page was when he took up knitting.
28412	Dr. Cox	Knitting?
28413	Dr. Kelso	Yeah, I thought he was gonna learn how to tie knots.
28414	J.D.	Hey, Dan?
28415	Dan	Hey, Johnnie. Just packing up. Thought you had to work?
28416	J.D.	I do, but I want to talk to you about something.
28417	Dan	Yeah, what's up?
28418	J.D.	Elliot doesn't want to have babies with Keith.
28419	Dan	Huh. Tough break for Keith. You know, I almost had a threesome with that guy.
28420	J.D.	When I said Elliot would never be into a guy like you, it's because you're a 35 year-old bartender who still lives in our mother's attic and is showing no signs of changing. I'm not saying this to make you feel bad, Dan, I'm telling you this because I think you have the potential to do whatever you want to do with your life. But you have to actually try.
28421	J.D.'s Narration	And then I got the answer I expected.
28422	Dan	Don't you have to get back to work?
28423	J.D.'s Narration	Even though I knew my brother wasn't going to change, Elliot was right. It comes down to what helps you sleep at night.
28424	Carla	Who are we kidding? This is so real now, there's no way we can sleep!
28425	J.D.'s Narration	Whether it's a sense of denial......or the fact that you love your son.As for me, I was just happy to get some rest.
28426	J.D.	Hey.
28427	Dan	Hey, Johnnie, is it cool if I borrow this suit? I figured I might wear it to that job interview.
28428	J.D.	You know what, man, you might as well just keep it.
28429	Dan	Yeah, I'll keep it. Hey, uh, you think anyone would ever really hire me?
28430	J.D.	I think you can do whatever you want to do.
28431	Dan	Take it easy, little brother.
28432	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
28433	J.D.'s Narration	Turk and Carla were converting my old bedroom into a nursery, so I helped paint a mural for the new baby.
28434	Turk & J.D.	Done.
28435	Carla	Oh, hell no.Is that big, ugly one shooting laser beams into the crib?
28436	Turk	That's Optimus Prime, and I don't think he'd appreciate you calling him the big, ugly one.
28437	J.D.	No, he wouldn't.
28438	Turk	No, he wouldn't.
28439	J.D.	Not Optimus.
28440	Turk	Secondly, if Junior gets scared, he can always climb into bed with us. That's what I did with my mom.
28441	Carla	What do you mean "did?" J.D., last Christmas I walked in on Turk and his mom cuddling in bed.
28442	J.D.'s Narration	Turk gets defensive when it comes to his mother.
28443	Turk	I think you're just jealous because your mom's dead.
28444	J.D.	Whoa! We should probably take a break.
28445	Carla	No, no no no, you're going to finish building that crib like you promised, and you are driving to the cemetery, cleaning up my mom's grave and asking her for forgiveness.
28446	Turk	I hate having to ask for forgiveness.
28447	Carla	How's my mom doing?
28448	Turk	I asked her if she still hated me and the sprinklers came on.
28449	Carla	Give her time. She's only been dead for three years.
28450	Turk	But, baby, it's too soon to be putting a nursery together, or test driving minivans, or buying baby monitors.
28451	J.D.	I can't get this crib together. And would somebody please bring me a glass of water?
28452	Carla	You go this time.
28453	J.D.	Thank you.
28454	J.D.'s Narration	Thinking about Turk and Carla becoming parents made me think about my own mom, and how much she probably misses me. I bet she wishes she could see what life is like around here through my eyes.And that's why I strapped my video camera on top of my head.
28455	Lonnie	Morning, weirdo.
28456	J.D.	Lonnie.
28457	J.D.'s Narration	It was the perfect idea. She got to meet my superiors.
28458	Dr. Kelso	Sorry, the old man stole some ice cream.
28459	J.D.'s Narration	I even got some great footage of Dr. Cox.
28460	Dr. Cox	Where the hell have you been?
28461	J.D.	I'm making a video postcard. Do you have a message for my mom?
28462	Dr. Cox	No, but since she brought you into this world, I have a message for her uterus.Bad uterus! Don't do that anymore.
28463	J.D.	She had a hysterectomy last month. I'm sure I can just edit over that part.
28464	Dr. Cox	Let's go see Mr. McNair.
28465	J.D.'s Narration	Mr. McNair had locked-in syndrome. A paralysis so severe that he could only communicate through a computer that responds to his eye movements.
28466	Dr. Cox	Check his vitals, Ava.
28467	Mr. McNair	Why does he call you a girl's name?
28468	J.D.	Oh, thank you for asking, Mr. MacNair. You see, the thing about Dr. Cox is the closer he feels to a person, the more he means to push them away. So when he calls me Ava, he's actually saying "J.D., I care about you." Vulnerable people, like...
28469	Mr. McNair	Oh my God. I get it now. Carol...Carol...Carol...Carol...Carol...
28470	J.D.	Now you're being a jerk...jerk...jerk...jerk! JERK!
28471	Dr. Cox	Newbie!
28472	J.D.	What?
28473	Dr. Cox	I'm relatively certain the computer is broken.
28474	J.D.	My bad.I felt bad for Mr. McNair, but I was off until six tonight, so I decided to grab a quick nap in the sun.What the...whoa!
28475	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
28476	Turk	Where the hell is J.D.?
28477	Carla	He's off until six.
28478	Turk	You know any second now he's going to come walking through that door all lost in his thoughts.
28479	Janitor's Thoughts	With Dorian taken care of, I'm not sure how I should spend my day. I suppose I could clean. Hee hee hee, God, help me, that one still makes me laugh. Oh, no. It's Black Kojak and Scary Nurse Wife. I'll get rid of them with an innocuous compliment.
28480	Janitor	You are glowing.
28481	Janitor's Thoughts	Free and clear.
28482	Turk	Have you seen J.D.?
28483	J.D.	Where am I? Hello? Anyone?
28484	Janitor	No. Don't know where he is.
28485	Janitor's Thoughts	Man, I love that adrenaline rush you get from lying to someone's face. Do it again!
28486	Janitor	Dr. Kelso, I must say, your nose hairs are not the least bit long and creepy like most old guys.
28487	Dr. Kelso	Thank you.Hey, Perry, great shirt! I wish I'd thought of athletic apparel when I went through my mid-life crisis. It would have been a hell of a lot less expensive than a cigarette boat named "Dr. Feelgood."
28488	Dr. Cox	That laughing had better not be aimed in my direction, bro.
28489	Turk	"Bro?" Dude, bros don't even use "bro." You're not as hip as you think you are.
28490	Dr. Cox	And you are?
28491	Turk	I'm black. God knew my people would go through some struggles, so He gave us a lifetime supply of cool to compensate. Just like He knew white people would be rhythmically challenged, so He gave y'all this dance.
28492	Dr. Cox	You're black? Because last I checked, you had a nerdy, white best friend, you enjoy Neil Diamond and you damn sure act like a black guy, and these, my friend, are all characteristics of a white guy. Please understand, I'm a big supporter of the NAACP, and if you don't know that stands for, it is the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. And quite frankly, I always thought they should change the "Colored People" to "African Americans" but then, of course, it wouldn't be the NAACP. It would be the N-Quad-A, or NAAAA, and I know this probably sounds like digression, but it actually leads me back to my original point. Do I think you're black? NAAAAAAHH!
28493	Nurse	Knock, knock!
28494	Janitor's Thoughts	Who's there? Nurse Mophead. Nurse Mophead, who? You have a mophead.
28495	Nurse	Well, your new computer should be here tonight.
28496	Janitor	She got out of here in a hurry, didn't she? I know what that's like, when people just say the bare minimum to you. But with me, it's usually "mop that floor," "clean that counter," "stop provoking that bear." Want me to keep you company? I mean, I don't mind. I'm just working on my own stuff anyway.I'm a bit of an inventor. Let me show you my latest one. Pen straw.Perfect. Except I don't like that cola. Tastes like ink. But that's just one. I got a million ideas.
28497	Elliot	I don't care if you're on the first floor. I need this cleaned up right now!
28498	Janitor	I'm here! Time to open up the window!
28499	Elliot	That was quick.
28500	Janitor	I call it the Hover Hoover. Where suction meets the sky.
28501	Elliot	That's a very good question. It's just the problem is that I've already answered it five times.
28502	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Reid, would you mind explaining why you called the chief of surgery to consult on a cellulitis patient yesterday?
28503	Elliot	I wasn't even here yesterday.
28504	Dr. Kelso	Yeah, but your interns were. And their mistakes are your mistakes. Whether it's an unnecessary consult or that young man's ridiculous haircut.
28505	Intern	This cost 60 dollars.
28506	Dr. Kelso	Let's hope your stylist put that money towards rehab.
28507	Elliot	Darn it, you guys, I'm sick and tired of all your careless mistakes. Lisa, why isn't this GI bleeder on telemetry? And, Keith, I know that you had a twelve hour shift yesterday, put that is no excuse for not turning in your patient histories.
28508	Keith	Elliot, you dragged me to dinner and then made me play Scrabble all night.
28509	Elliot	How you spend your private life isn't my responsibility, OK?
28510	Keith	Fine, I'll do them tonight.
28511	Elliot	Oh, you can't. You're taking me to the movies. Get on the ball, Keith! All of you, go work.
28512	Carla	Wow. Aren't you the big, bad-ass attending?
28513	Elliot	Yeah, well, it's time for them to sink or swim. I got to where I am on my own, OK?
28514	Carla	Nobody helped you out in the beginning, huh?
28515	Elliot	Dr. Cox was my attending. He was nice enough to keep track of the number of times he made me cry.
28516	Dr. Cox	27, counting this morning.
28517	Elliot	Hm. Yeah, I'm PMS-ing and he made fun of my shoes.
28518	Dr. Cox	Laverne? What are you doing out here?
28519	Laverne	Well, tonight's date night with Mr. Roberts, and I like to prime the pump by watching the young men sweat.
28520	Dr. Cox	Uh-huh.
28521	Turk	Hey, Dr. Cox, if I wasn't a black man, could I do this?That's game, all right? That's game. You got next?
28522	Dr. Cox	Yeah, I got next.
28523	Turk	Well, I should warn you, they call me the candy man because my moves are so sweet.
28524	Todd	Yeah, and they call me the pig because I say sexist and derogatory things to women.
28525	Laverne	Lonnie! Play with Dr. Cox.
28526	Lonnie	Let's go!
28527	Turk	HA! Look at the glasses! Look at the mouthpiece!
28528	Laverne	Dr. Turk is not aware the Lonnie was All-Conference at Villanova.
28529	Dr. Cox	Laverne, would you go ahead and thank what's-his-name for me?
28530	Laverne	Jesus?
28531	Dr. Cox	That's him. Let's go!
28532	Turk	Check ball.
28533	Carla	Lisa, why did you order 100 units of insulin for Mrs. Best?
28534	Lisa	No, that's only 10 units. I just put a smiley face after the zero.
28535	Carla	Look, Lisa, you have to be crystal clear with your medical orders.OK, it's causing a bit of a seizure. Hey, Janitor! Come here, would you hold her legs down, please!
28536	Janitor's Thoughts	This is it. I'm in the show! Dr. Jan Itor!
28537	Carla	I'll give her an amp of E 50.
28538	Janitor	This is easy. It's just like drowning someone.
28539	Carla	OK, you can let her legs go now, I think we're good.
28540	Janitor	I didn't see the demon leave the body.
28541	Carla	I'm sure it did. Hey, Janitor, good job.
28542	Janitor	Good job.
28543	Lisa	Dr. Reid will kill me when she finds out about this.
28544	Carla	Relax, I'll go talk to Dr. Reid. It won't be a big deal.
28545	Elliot	What?! Oh, I'm gonna make someone burn for this. Who did it, Carla?
28546	Janitor	I guess I just never knew how much I picked up just from working here, you know? I heard her yell "hold this woman's legs down!" And instinctively, I just I knew what to do.
28547	Laverne	Good for you. Now I have to go meet my husband at the bus station and pretend to be a street walker.
28548	Janitor	Enjoy your date night!
28549	Janitor's Thoughts	OK, Mr. Cool-Guy. You had your moment of glory, no need to make a big deal out of it.
28550	Janitor	Hey!Slow down, buddy, what's the hurry? Come here. I'm gonna tell you a little story about a hero.
28551	Janitor's Thoughts	You know what? The hell with it. It feels good to get a little attention.
28552	Janitor's Narration	I'll tell you one thing. It's sure beats falling flat on your ass...
28553	Dr. Cox	Holy Moley! That'd be really embarrassing if you were black! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
28554	Turk	Great.
28555	Elliot	Seriously, Carla, I need to know who's responsible for this.
28556	Janitor's Narration	...Or lying to cover someone's ass.
28557	Carla	I don't know. It was just a clerical error. There's no way to trace it.
28558	Janitor	Was I brave? Brave is a strong word. Perhaps the word is valiant. Off you go.
28559	Janitor's Narration	Anyway, for once I didn't feel like a jerk.
28560	Nurse	Is he still talking about holding that patient's legs?
28561	Doctor	Oh, give him a break. You know how hard it is to come here and bust our humps every day? Imagine how hard it is to come here knowing you don't make a difference.
28562	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
28563	Janitor	Drill fork. It's a drill and fork. Mostly fork. You know what, I don't care what those people said. I know I make a difference around here.
28564	Doctor	Hey, Jill.
28565	Janitor	They don't know how different it would be if I wasn't here.
28566	Doctor	Hey, Jill.
28567	Janitor	Yup. A lot of lives would change. In fact, I'm gonna prove that to them right now. I am going to fix your computer. I've just gotta go get my real tools. I've turned all of these into eating utensils. Dig in.
28568	Dr. Kelso	Do you know what time it is?
28569	Janitor's Thoughts	4:15.
28570	Janitor	3:30.
28571	Dr. Kelso	Oh, thank goodness, I thought I was running late.
28572	Janitor's Thoughts	I do love to lie.
28573	Elliot	Look at my face. Keith, what does it mean when I'm frowning?
28574	Keith	That you're feeling insecure and you're suspicious that I think someone on television is prettier than you.
28575	Elliot	At work, Keith.
28576	Keith	Ah t
28577	Elliot	Well, Keith was half-right. This face does mean that I am suspicious. I was reviewing the medical records and I realized that Mrs. Best received an inordinate amount of insulin and I wanna know who screwed up.
28578	Carla	Elliot?You're wasting your time, you know how interns stick together. They're never going to rat each other out.
28579	Elliot	What you're forgetting, Carla, is that I am sleeping with one of those interns. Now seeing that I've already gotten Keith to pee sitting down so that there's absolutely no chance of seat splatter, I'm betting that I'm probably going to be able to get them to talk. Keith! Meet me in the cafe in half an hour.
28580	Carla	Keith, you better not tell her who did it.
28581	Keith	But Elliot scares me.
28582	Carla	Elliot is a blonde, 108-pound ski-pole from a cul-de-sac in Connecticut. I am an underpaid, pregnant nurse from the block, who, over the next six months, will become fatter and angrier. Now who are you really afraid of?
28583	Keith	The fatty.
28584	Carla	Be careful, Keith.Oh, I love it. And you know, they say it's the safest thing we can do for our baby. Can we get it?
28585	Turk	No. No, no, no, let's get back before someone sees it, matter of fact, get down! Scoot down!
28586	Carla	Hey!
28587	Dr. Cox	Hello, that's a nice ride, huh, Dexter?I hate to bother you, but, uh, could you explain to me one more time, what's it like to be a young, hip, black guy?
28588	Turk	See, Dr. Cox, what I'ma do, is we gonn' pimp dis out. We gonn' throw some 22's on it, put some spinners on the 22's...
28589	Carla	Oh! And a DVD player so the kids can watch Elmo!
28590	Turk	You're killing me, woman.
28591	Janitor's Narration	Sometimes around here, it feels like humiliation is contagious.
28592	Dr. Cox	Whoo!
28593	Janitor	Mr. McNair, I didn't exactly fix your computer. I think I might have voided your warranty.
28594	Keith	Elliot, I am not going to tell you who messed up with Mrs. Best.
28595	Elliot	Ah, no problem. I just wanted to grab a cup of coffee. Oh, and introduce you to my mom.
28596	Mrs. Reid	Ha, "mom." That makes me sound so old. I had C-sections with all my kids, so everything is as it was down there.
28597	Keith	Uh, very nice to meet you, Mrs. Reid.
28598	Mrs. Reid	You and Elliot would have such cute babies. I keep telling her, she's only got five more years to pop one out. Have you ever seen chubby Elliot?
28599	Keith	Uh, no.
28600	Mrs. Reid	Well, if you want to see it, just break up with her and wait a couple of weeks. When she's depressed, she hits a bag of Doritos like there's diamonds at the bottom.
28601	Elliot	Hmm, love you too, Mom.
28602	Mrs. Reid	Ah! That's your dad. How'd you get this number?
28603	Elliot	You like her? Because if you don't tell me which intern screwed up, I'm going to beg her to move here.
28604	Keith	She's just a little weird, Elliot. I can handle weird.
28605	Mrs. Reid	I'm sorry, the light just hit you so perfectly. I had to have a taste. No, not you.
28606	Keith	It was Lisa. I would have told you earlier, but someone told me not to.
28607	Elliot	Who told you not to?
28608	Carla	Baby, you're not really bothered by what Dr. Cox said, are you? You know you're my black prince!
28609	Turk	Baby, that's not it. I know I'm black, I'm reminded all the time. Patient doesn't want a black doctor, people think I know the score to every NBA game, and I told you what happened last week, when the new board member met the surgical staff.
28610	Board Member	Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Hey, what up, dog? Nice to meet you.
28611	Turk	It's not even about that. It's about the nursery. It's about that stupid minivan. I don't know if you know this, but overnight I went from Chris Turk Stud to Grandpa Turk. The guy who wears overalls and does embarrassing dances at cookouts.
28612	Carla	you do that now.
28613	Turk	But in a cool way.
28614	Dr. Kelso	Hey. Thanks to your telling me the wrong time prank, I was 45 minutes late for my oriental massage. Which meant that instead of Pang Wa, I had to settle for Qing Lao.
28615	Janitor	So?
28616	Dr. Kelso	Qing Lao is A DUDE! You know, I've accepted the fact that you're useless around here. Maybe you should try a little harder and not make things worse.
28617	Janitor	See you know he doesn't get, is that I could have been a janitor anywhere. When I got out of college, I had offers, man. Morgan Stanley, DuPont. I even considered taking a year off and cleaning my way across Europe. But no, I chose a hospital. And I'm no kidding myself. I know I don't have the most important job in the world, but I work in a place that helps people, and I always thought that I was part of that. Who cares?
28618	Elliot	Have you seen Carla?
28619	Dr. Cox	Nope. My turn. Have ever seen how stupid you look when you do your angry-quick walk?
28620	Elliot	Carla covered for one of my interns and then lied to my face about it.
28621	Dr. Cox	Come on. Of course she did. If an intern got hammered by their attending and stripped what little self-confidence they have every time they messed up, there wouldn't be any interns left. And lucky for everyone in this dump, Carla happens to have been here long enough to identify when someone needs to be protected.
28622	Elliot	These kids need to start standing on their own...
28623	Dr. Cox	You got that right sister, because you definitely got where you are all on your own.
28624	Elliot	Well you sure as hell didn't give me any help.
28625	Dr. Cox	I didn't say I did.
28626	Carla	It's OK, really. It's not a big deal.
28627	Elliot	Dr. Cox is going to kill me.
28628	Carla	Well, Dr. Cox doesn't have to find out. Just promise me that you're going to practice repositioning just once.
28629	Elliot	I promise.
28630	Carla	OK.Turk, I get it. Having a baby changes things.
28631	Turk	I just don't want to say goodbye to the life we have now, you know?
28632	Carla	Baby, you don't have to. We'll still have fun. Go to bars, go dancing.
28633	Turk	Really?
28634	Carla	No. We'll have a baby, that would be crazy. Just focus on the positives. For instance, we'll still have lots of sex.
28635	Turk	Really?
28636	Carla	No! But I can tell you that this is normal. You'll get through it.
28637	Turk	Come to think of it, what would really help me get through it...
28638	Carla	Man you're gullible today.
28639	Janitor	Well, Mr. McNair, hope you didn't mind me hanging out all day talking to you. I don't think you do mind. I've got a seventh sense about that sort of thing. My sixth sense is I can tell when squirrels are afraid. Anyway, I know you lost your computer and I thought maybe you were a little bit lonely. I've been lonely around here a couple times. I don't know. I just hope I helped.
28640	Dr. Cox	Nobody's buying it. Here we go, your new computer is finally here, sorry it took so long.
28641	Janitor	What time is it?
28642	Dr. Cox	Uh, 6:00.
28643	J.D.	WAAAHHH!
28644	Janitor	How was your day?
28645	J.D.	Cold.
28646	Janitor's Thoughts	Now help him up so he thinks there's hope for our relationship yet.
28647	J.D.'s Narration	Even though the Janitor had basically kidnapped me, when he helped me up, I couldn't help but feel there was hope for our relationship yet. I guess being locked up all day really make you appreciate the things that really matter...
28648	Elliot	Hey, did I ever thank you for all the help you've given me over the years?
28649	Carla	Don't sweat it.
28650	J.D's Narration	...Like the support of a friend...
28651	Turk	What up, dawg? Yeah, you know I'm down to play ball, I just gotta drop Junior off with the old lady at the ducky park. Yeah. Yeah, then we gonn' hoop it up. Hey, you know what, this isn't gonna work. I can't, I can't.
28652	Dr. Cox	And there you go, Mr. McNair.
28653	Mr. McNair	Thank you.
28654	Dr. Cox	Don't mention it.
28655	Mr. McNair	I wasn't talking to you.
28656	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
28657	J.D.	Todd, what are you doing?
28658	Todd	Waiting for my moment.
28659	J.D.'s Narration	OK, moving on. It was time for my new daily ritual: asking Dr. Cox to lunch.
28660	J.D.	Hey, Dr. Cox, what are you doing for lunch?
28661	Dr. Cox	Not having it with you, Paula.
28662	J.D.	Oh, good luck eating. This is every spoon from the cafeteria. And guess what? Today just happens to be soup and frozen yogurt day.
28663	Elliot	Ooh! I'm gonna have, uh, tomato and strawberry.
28664	Dr. Cox	Lunch for us, not going to happen. Normally, I'd tell you something harsh right about now, like "we're not friends," but then you'll just grin that stupid grin and shake your head back and forth, like "how could that possibly be true?"
28665	J.D.	Because it's ludicrous.
28666	Dr. Cox	Ah, just give me a spoon, will you please?Oh, for goodness sake.
28667	J.D.	You called my bluff, and today isn't soup and frozen yogurt day, it's actually salad and smoothie day.
28668	Elliot	I'm still having tomato and strawberry.
28669	Carla	I'm having a weird pregnancy craving. Hey, J.D., if you go out, would you give me a hot Italian sausage?
28670	Todd	I got a hot Italian sausage for you right here! People think I just luck into these situations, but it's really a lot of hard work. You know what else is hard? I should go.
28671	J.D.	I think I may vomit.
28672	J.D.'s Narration	Some doctors like to change into their streets when they go out for lunch. Not me. I like how the world reacts to me as a doctor. Whether it's a friendly greeting from the world's slowest bagger...
28673	World's Slowest Bagger	Hey there, Dr. Dorian.
28674	J.D.	Lookin' good pal, eggs on top, OK? Eggs on top.
28675	J.D.'s Narration	...Or a smile from the manager of the herbal section.
28676	J.D.	Hey, Rebecca, you got that echinacea for me? Just kidding, you know I think all this stuff is voodoo. Good to see you. Hey, looks like somebody else is sick of that cafeteria stuff, huh?
28677	Dr. Cox	Aw, now what the hell, do you follow me here?
28678	J.D.	A friend dropped me off.EAGLE!Hey, wanna go splitsies on some deli counter meatloaf? I can't finish a whole serving. I mean I can, but I don't like to. It all goes right here.
28679	Dr. Cox	God, could this be any more of a nightmare?
28680	Jill	Guys!
28681	J.D.'s Narration	Yes, it could be more of a nightmare. Jill Tracy was a former patient who had once tried to kill herself. Sad, yes, but this did not change the fact that she was unbelievably annoying.
28682	Jill	Oh my God, what are you doing here? I was supposed to meet a guy for a date. I know what you're thinking, a Tuesday lunch date at the supermarket? He is so not into her. Well guess what? He's not!I waited for an hour just thinking "how many more guys from my yoga class can reject me before just saying enough,"
28683	J.D.	Oh, we have to get back to the hospital.
28684	Jill	Bummer. Trail mix! Arrarrarr! Ha, I'm just kidding, I won't. Oh, stop, I'll have some.
28685	Dr. Cox	You know what, Newbie, stay. Have lunch.
28686	J.D.	One of those emergencies, I should probably go, too. How are things?
28687	Jill	Mmm...
28688	Rebecca	You know that's stealing.
28689	J.D.	Oh, come on, Rebecca, everybody's doing it.I won't tell anyone if you don't.
28690	Rebecca	Security!
28691	J.D.	Security?
28692	Rebecca	We've got a grazer.
28693	J.D.	I don't think there's a security force at...OK, hey fellas.
28694	Jill	Ha ha! Wherever you're taking him, take me, too! Nah, you go ahead.
28695	J.D.	Where's the shaving cream, is that aisle two, still?
28696	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
28697	J.D.'s Narration	Today was a busy day at Sacred Heart.We had three separate patients waiting for transplants. And we were doing everything we could to keep them alive until we could locate donors. There was Mrs. Sikes, who needed a new liver. There was Mr. Dennison, who needed a new heart valve. And then there was Dr. Cox's guy, Dave Bradford.
28698	Dr. Cox	So, now, Davey-boy, I promise you, we're going to find you a kidney. I would literally swear on my father's grave, but whenever I go there, I usually just end up dancing on it.
28699	Mr. Bradford	And so begins another round of "who had the worst dad." One of my pop's nicknames for me was Sparky, because he liked to light matches off my neck.
28700	Dr. Cox	We've been over this before. You win on account of your father's not dead yet.
28701	J.D.'s Narration	Most doctors stressed with so many people clinging to life. Dr. Cox vibed on it.
28702	Dr. Cox	As I lie in bed each morning and ask myself why I should put both feet on the floor, there are precious few reasons that I've ever been able to come up with. A chance to escape Jordan's morning breath? Sure. Scotch! It's too early to drink it, yes, but people, it is never too early to think about. And of course, the ever present possibility that I might finally happen upon Hugh Jackman and be able to give him the present that I've been holding for him.BAM! Still, the most persuasive argument I've ever been able to come up with is the fact that I get to come here, to this hospital, every day and help keep people alive.
28703	Turk	That's ironic, because four people just died while you were talking.
28704	Elliot	Look, we need to keep these people going until we can find donors.
28705	Dr. Cox	All right, Barbie, go check on Mrs. Sikes' ammonia levels, she's encephalopathic.Gandhi, review Dennison's chart and get me a consent.Bobbo! Get on the horn to cronies at local hospitals and get me a donor update.
28706	Dr. Kelso	Fine, some of the boys are coming over tonight anyway, I'll bring it up to Morrison while he sets up the projector for the stag flicks.
28707	Dr. Cox	Just the organs, Bob, don't need the visual of old men with erections.
28708	Carla	And now it's in my head forever.
28709	Dr. Cox	Sorry, go step up Davey's dialysis to take your mind off of it.Newbie, you feel like a sandwich?
28710	J.D.	I do feel like a sandwich.
28711	Dr. Cox	You feel more like a pastry, a very doughy pastry. I don't feel good about that. Way too easy.
28712	J.D.'s Narration	I had one objective: Pick up everyone's lunch at the grocery store and get out of dodge.
28713	J.D.	Whoa!
28714	Jill	J.D.!
28715	J.D.	Hey, Jill.
28716	Jill	How weird is it that we're both here two days in a row?
28717	J.D.	Mmm.
28718	Jill	I was thinking there might be a 50% chance that the guy who blew me off yesterday just got his days wrong and would be waiting here with roses. Is that sad?
28719	J.D.	It's not not sad.
28720	Jill	Plus I have the whole day free. My shrink couldn't make our appointment. He found his third wife in bed with his second wife and got so depressed that he downed an entire bottle of his bulimic daughter's Prozac. So now he's back in the hospital.
28721	J.D.	That's an awesome story, Jill.
28722	Jill	It's true, heh hee hee.
28723	Elliot	Hey, what did you do last night?
28724	Carla	Turk made me watch Anaconda with him.
28725	Elliot	Oh, is that the one with the giant snake?
28726	Todd	No, this is the one with the giant snake. I was back here for 45 minutes waiting for a setup. My back is killing me. But I nailed it. It's about commitment.
28727	Carla	Hey, how could your intern used to sleep with him?
28728	Elliot	She's a tramp with no morals.
28729	Lisa	I never slept with the Todd.
28730	Elliot	Lisa is sweet and people just don't give her a chance.
28731	Carla	I wonder who else Todd lied about sleeping with.
28732	Nurse #1	I didn't sleep with him.
28733	Nurse #2	God no.
28734	Nurse #3	Are you kidding me?
28735	Gloria	Todd, is he the big, black security guard with the hook hand?
28736	Elliot	Uh, no.
28737	Gloria	Then no.
28738	Mr. Bradford	So I am I ever getting out of here?
28739	Dr. Cox	We haven't found you a kidney yet, but I have some ideas.
28740	Mr. Bradford	Yeah, this will do.
28741	J.D.	Ah, what the hell. I can live with one kidney.
28742	Dr. Cox	Because we'll probably just go ahead and sell this one.
28743	J.D.	Stay away from my organs!
28744	Turk	Dude, what the hell are you doing?
28745	J.D.	Having lunch. The cafeteria stinks and I can't go to the grocery store because apparently crazy Jill Tracy lives there. Every time I try and shop she follows me around, like I'm her only friend in the world. It's pathetic.
28746	Turk	I'm gonna go talk to Carla.
28747	J.D.	I'll come, too.
28748	Turk	Figured.
28749	Carla	Hey, why do you think Todd lies about hooking up with all those women?
28750	Elliot	Maybe he's just overcompensating. You know, my brother, Barry, used to brag about all the girls he was dating, right before he quit JV baseball and started dancing for Japanese businessmen.
28751	Turk	Todd's not gay.
28752	Carla	Turk, he has leather jeans in, like, three different colors.
28753	Elliot	Barry used to dance in leather jeans. He'd come home and they'd be stuffed with yen.
28754	Janitor	I'll tell you when I first suspected he was gay. It was very subtly, but...
28755	J.D.	Oh, yeah, Dale, this is totally going to bring out your pecs. Plus, I'm using olive oil so I can lick it off later. Make 'em dance!Oh, they're dancing! Somebody's making them dance! Whooo-wee!Tell them it never happened!
28756	Janitor	It happened. I was there.
28757	Dr. Cox	I think I just got the move on signal from a hook.
28758	Elliot, Turk & Carla	Mmhmm.
28759	Dr. Cox	Anyway, give me the update here.
28760	Carla	Your guy Bradford's electrolyte and fluid balance are stable.
28761	Turk	Mr. Dennison isn't looking so good. He's on max inotropes and still in failure.
28762	Elliot	Mrs. Sikes is fully encephalopathic. Her ammonium level's through the roof. She's circling the drain.
28763	Dr. Cox	Come on, now, let's try to keep these people alive. What do you say?
28764	Lisa	Dr. Dorian? Can you help me?
28765	J.D.	Sure, what's going on?
28766	Lisa	She was admitted a short time ago and she hasn't regained consciousness. Tox screen's positive for cocaine.Do you think she could have OD'd?
28767	J.D.	She had been, uh, stood up on a couple dates. And, uh, she hadn't seen her shrink in a while. She was definitely depressed.
28768	Lisa	How do you know all that?
28769	J.D.	She told me.
28770	J.D.'s Narration	In hospitals, there are certain rules.With surgeons, if the overcompensating, pumped-up, shaved-down doctor seems gay...
28771	Turk	'Sup, man, you trying a new workout?
28772	Todd	No, why?Oh, he's glistening.
28773	J.D.'s Narration	...He's probably gay.And if there's good news for one doctor...
28774	Dr. Cox	People, I've got our organs.
28775	J.D.'s Narration	...It probably means bad news for another.
28776	Mrs. Tracy	You can use her organs.
28777	J.D.	Thank you.
28778	Mrs. Tracy	Just tell me this: Is there anything anyone could have done?
28779	J.D.	No.
28780	J.D.'s Thoughts	Unless you mean me.
28781	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
28782	J.D.'s Narration	It's amazing how quickly people improve once they get a new organ. Whether it's Mrs. Sikes, with her new liver, Mr. Dennison, with his new heart valve, or Dave.
28783	Dr. Cox	How, uh, how does that new kidney feel, huh?
28784	Mr. Bradford	It's a little loose. But I'll get used to it.
28785	Dr. Cox	Yeah you will.
28786	Mr. Bradford	Hey, thanks for everything, man.
28787	Dr. Cox	Don't sweat it.All right, people, gather round, here we go. Now, I'm sure we all recognize how rare it is to get a win like this, but seeing as we're surrounding by patients who are clinging to life, I'm going to give kudos in whisper form. And since I am an egomaniac, first props come to me. Let me hear it, people.
28788	Turk	You are some kind of superhero.
28789	Carla	You're a god.
28790	Elliot	You're a beautiful healer.
28791	Dr. Cox	This was not a complete and total solo effort. It was an extraordinary job done by each and every one of you.
28792	Dr. Kelso	I can't hear a word he's saying.
28793	Dr. Cox	Be older, Bob.
28794	Dr. Kelso	Oh, just because I can't hear your silly-ass whispering, it doesn't mean I'm old. Matter of fact, I'm going over to my office to tinker with my new computer.
28795	Turk	Ooh, what kind is it?
28796	Dr. Kelso	It's about 3:30. Ha ha ha ha! I heard what he said, people, but damn that joke's a classic.
28797	Dr. Cox	And why are you not giddy with praise, like those other people? Don't you know I dole out compliments at most once a year? And like a squirrel, you must gather these acorns of kind words to sustain you for the upcoming cold, sarcastic months.
28798	J.D.	Any idiot could have seen that Jill was in trouble. I'm supposed to be a doctor, and I'm the reason she's dead.
28799	J.D.'s Narration	Then he said the words I never expected to hear.
28800	Dr. Cox	Why don't you and I go grab some lunch. That'd be good. Come on.
28801	Elliot	Oh, my God, he looks so sad.
28802	Carla	I just want to hold him like a big, gay baby.
28803	Turk	Ugh, this is incredible. An hour ago, you guys hated him.
28804	Carla	An hour he wasn't our new, gay best friend.
28805	Turk	Leave the Todd alone, OK? Because every time you two meddle, you know who suffers? Me. Remember when the Janitor took that chiropractic class and you guys wanted to encourage him?Guys, uh, I'm really not comfortable with this.
28806	Janitor	Now, now, you'll be fine. I've already done this on four mop heads, all right? Haven't had a complaint yet.OK.
28807	Turk	Oh.
28808	Janitor	On three. One, two...
28809	Turk	AAAHH!
28810	Janitor	Better? Yes?
28811	Turk	WWAAAAAAHHAAAHAHAHAHAAAAA!!
28812	Elliot	You're fine. We're doing this.
28813	Janitor	I can fix that, buddy. On the count of three. One, two...
28814	Turk	Ooohh!
28815	Janitor	Yeah?
28816	Turk	No.
28817	Janitor	You owe me 500 dollars.
28818	Surveyor	Excuse me, could you spare a few minutes for AIDS research?
28819	Dr. Cox	Yes, I can, but I'm not sure just how much we'll get done. I tell you what. We'll go over here and brainstorm while we wolf down these sandwiches. Newbie, come.
28820	J.D.'s Thoughts	Vintage Cox.
28821	J.D.	You know what I was thinking the whole time I was havig lunch with Jill?
28822	Dr. Cox	What's that?
28823	J.D.	God, this girl's annoying.
28824	Dr. Cox	I saw her in that supermarket, too, but I'm not torturing myself. Would you like to know why?
28825	J.D.	Why?
28826	Dr. Cox	Because she didn't come to the hospital looking for help. We just randomly bumped into her out here in the world. I mean, don't get me wrong, if a guy gets shot, or if he has a heart attack and I am physically the closest doctor to him, I will intervene. But shy of that, you can't. I mean, you just can't. It's too much to ask of yourself.
28827	J.D.	OK, I hear you.
28828	Dr. Cox	No, you don't. Once you start blaming yourself for deaths that aren't your fault, my friend, that's a slippery slope that you can't come back from. And trust me, I've seen it ruin a hell of a lot of good doctors and I will not let it happen to you.
28829	J.D.'s Narration	And because he said that, I knew it wouldn't.
28830	Elliot	Game time. Let's go.
28831	Carla	Todd? Do you have a second?
28832	Todd	I was actually on my way to the gym.
28833	Carla	That's kind of what it's about.
28834	Todd	Whoa. Did something happen to the gym? Don't lie to me.
28835	Elliot	We know about your...
28836	Carla	...Situation.
28837	Elliot	You are hiding from yourself.
28838	Carla	Stop hiding, Todd.
28839	Elliot	We accept you.
28840	Carla	No matter who you love.
28841	Todd	The Todd's confused.
28842	Elliot	He was like a little baby. Ah ha, well you were wrong. It went great. I mean, at first, the Todd was a little emotional, but by the end of it, he was saying how happy he was that he didn't have to lie. And then he French-braided my hair, and then took it out because he said I could not pull it off. Oh, he is so honest.
28843	Carla	It was great, it was like he changed into a whole new person. God, how awesome is it gonna be without that inappropriate pig wandering the halls anymore?
28844	Todd	Hey, Mickhead? Is that package for me? You know it is!
28845	Turk	You ladies must be so proud.
28846	Elliot	Todd, what what are you doing?
28847	Todd	I'm getting my gay on. Hey, buddy, you and I should totally have sex some time.
28848	Turk	See, I knew this would come back to me.
28849	Dr. Cox	What the hell is going on?
28850	Turk	Everybody's failing. Mrs. Sikes is indicating peripheral neuropathy, my valve transplant patient's suffering partial complex seizures.
28851	Dr. Cox	How, uh, how're you feeling, there, Davey?
28852	Mr. Bradford	Pretty good. But my feet are a little numb.
28853	Dr. Cox	You hang tight, all right?
28854	Mr. Bradford	OK.
28855	Dr. Cox	I don't get it. I don't get — that makes sense.
28856	Dr. Kelso	Perry, the autopsy just came in on your donor, Jill Tracy. She didn't die of an overdose.
28857	J.D.'s Narration	And just like that, whatever burden of responsibility I felt was lifted. But like I said before, good news for one person can mean bad news for another.
28858	Dr. Cox	She died of rabies? OK, people, all of our transplant patients are infected. We now know what we're dealing with. Let's get involved, we can do this.
28859	Surgeon	Todd, you were impressive in surgery today.
28860	Todd	Thanks, man, you were really impressive in the shower this morning. You know, dong-wise.
28861	Carla	Todd!
28862	Todd	What?
28863	Carla	Stop it!
28864	Elliot	The whole point of coming to grips with your sexuality was to accept yourself and stop being that guy.
28865	Todd	I'm sorry. This whole change is just scaring me. I'm not sure who I am anymore.
28866	Carla	Come here.
28867	Elliot	Oh, get over here, sweetie.
28868	Todd	Oh.
28869	Elliot	It's OK, let it out.
28870	Carla	We're here for you.
28871	Todd	Ohh..Brbrbbrbrbrbrbrb...
28872	Carla	WHOA!
28873	Todd	Motorboating. You know, I really gotta thank you gals for outing me. Chicks dig gay dudes.Hey, Lisa. I heard you lied and said we didn't do it. Admit it. We doinked.
28874	Lisa	I was sad because my dad died.
28875	Todd	I wasn't.
28876	Carla	So this whole thing was an act?
28877	Elliot	Oh, my God, I cannot believe I let you into that fitting room yesterday while I was trying on bras.
28878	Carla	Ew.
28879	Todd	That was a very special time for me.
28880	Elliot	Ohh.
28881	Carla	Unbelievable.
28882	Elliot	He saw the girls.
28883	Todd	Oh, it's cool if you want to walk away, ladies, 'cuz I love to watch you go.Nothing wrong with those.Nothing wrong with that either.Or that.Or that. Phew.
28884	Janitor	What the hell are you?
28885	Todd	I'm the Todd.
28886	J.D.'s Narration	We did everything we could over the next few days to keep the transplant patients going, but odds were against us.First we lost Mrs. Sikes......And then Mr. Dennison.And I knew that Dr. Cox needed me the exact same way I needed him earlier.
28887	J.D.	Hey. Hungry?
28888	Dr. Cox	No.
28889	J.D.	I guess that lunch was kind of a one-time thing, huh?There's no way you could have seen that coming. I mean, rabies? Come on, there's, like, three reported cases a year. In fact testing for it would have been irresponsible. You would have wasted time those people didn't have.
28890	Dr. Cox	I was obsessed with getting those organs.
28891	J.D.	You had to be. The fact is, those people were going to die in a number of hours and you had to make a call. I would have made the same call.
28892	Dr. Cox	Yeah?
28893	J.D.	Yes. Now I got us lunch. And I think we should eat it.Right then I knew I was going to pull him out of this. But unfortunately, sometimes the hospital picks a day where it's just going to pile it on.
28894	Dr. Cox	Oh, God. Come on.Clear!Still in V-tach, clear!Come on. VF, Clear!Aw, come on. Come on, Come on! GOD! GOD, GOD!He wasn't about to die, was he, Newbie? Could have waited another month for a kidney.
28895	J.D.	Where are you going? Your shift's not over. Hey! Remember what you told me? The second you start blaming yourself for people's deaths...there's no coming back.
28896	Dr. Cox	Yeah...you're right.
28897	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
28898	J.D.'s Narration	If you work at a hospital long enough, you learn to expect anything. Whether it's Dr. Kim, who makes patients take their pants off, no matter what...
28899	Dr. Kim	Yep, you've got pink-eye.
28900	Patient	Can I put my pants back on?
28901	Dr. Kim	Right after I put some drops in.
28902	J.D.'s narration	...Or nobody remembering Ray Catay's eightieth birthday.
28903	Mr. Catay	Why aren't you guys making a bigger fuss?
28904	J.D.	Uh, I would have, Mr. Catay, but Dr. Reid is throwing a huge celebration for you later.
28905	J.D.'s Narration	I should tell her about that. The truth is, with modern medicine, 80 isn't that big a deal anymore. It's not like the olden days.
28906	J.D.	Let us not feel sorrow for Bobby Adams. He was 12. He lead a full life. He will be missed, especially by his beautiful wife, Jenny, who stood by him even when he turned 6 and had a midlife crisis and was caught banging one of those naked people who brought us corn.I'd be the oldest man in pilgrim village.
28907	J.D.'s Narration	Still, you should always celebrate life, because you never know when it's going to throw you a curve ball. Like with Dr. Cox. He recently made a decision any doctor would have made and because of it, three patients died. At first, he was inconsolably sad.After that, he started acting out.
28908	Jordan	In his defense, he did ask for dressing on the side.
28909	Dr. Cox	Dahpne!
28910	Lisa	I heard that he attacked one of the busboys.
28911	Keith	Yeah, and I heard that he bitch-slapped the maitre-d'.
28912	J.D.	Yeah, enough, gang. That's how rumors get started. Hell, Gloria, I made a joke once that you hooked up with Leonard, the big, black security guard with the hook hand. Now everyone thinks it's true.
28913	Gloria	It is true. And I'm never going back!
28914	Leonard	Gloria! I love me some white meat.
28915	J.D.	OK. Well, make sure to put antiseptic on any puncture wounds, OK? Now, I know Dr. Cox seems crazy mad at the world right now, but let's remember. Three patients died. What's amazing is that he can take a hit like that, one that would knock the rest of us out for good, and come out the other side still standing. That's why the man's an inspiration. I mean, he is a rock.
28916	J.D.'s Narration	Yup, he's the best damn doctor here.
28917	Dr. Cox	Newbie, will you give me a little trouble? I'm having some help here.
28918	J.D.'s Narration	Oh, no.
28919	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
28920	Carla	All right, people, listen up. We are a family. And what do families do when one of their own is in trouble?
28921	Elliot	When my brother, Barry, came out of the closet my parents sent him to hetero camp.
28922	Carla	Families that aren't from Connecticut, Elliot.
28923	J.D.'s Narration	Pregnancy had made Carla a little hormonal.
28924	Carla	Now, Dr. Kelso, I've asked you to keep this matter away from the board. Were you able to do that, sir?
28925	Dr. Kelso	Nurse Espinosa, I was...
28926	Carla	WERE YOU?!
28927	Dr. Kelso	YES! I told them Dr. Cox was going to take a leave of absence due to problems at home. Should anyone ask, you beat him.
28928	Jordan	Beat him, got it.
28929	J.D.	I couldn't believe how depressed he was yesterday.
28930	Elliot	Oh, it was so sad.
28931	Janitor	Oh, I know. When I first heard about it was like "whoa, no way!"
28932	J.D.	You don't even know what we're talking about.
28933	Janitor	Sure, I do. The donkey boy up in the ICU.
28934	Carla	We're talking about Dr. Cox.
28935	Janitor	Oh. Well if anyone's interested, there's a donkey boy in the ICU.
28936	Turk	Baby?
28937	Carla	No, Turk. Now, Dr. Cox needs our help getting through this. Jordan can watch him in the morning and at night, but she's also got Jack. Plus, she's not that emotionally available.
28938	Jordan	I'm dead inside.
28939	Carla	Anyway, we're all going to spend time with him. I've made up a schedule. I've got the first shift. Unless there are any questions, this meeting is adjourned.
28940	Elliot	Ooh!
28941	Turk	Gosh!
28942	Elliot	What?
28943	Dr. Kelso	For God's sake, Reid, there's a donkey boy upstairs.
28944	Turk	Damn, that boy is going to town on that carrot.
28945	Dr. Kelso	You fellows want to go to a real donkey show? It's really very tastefully done. I understand one of the women who entertains the donkey used to be on a soap.
28946	Turk & J.D.	Pass.
28947	Dr. Kelso	Well, standing invitation, every Thursday.
28948	J.D.	Always pass, sir.
28949	Dr. Kelso	Well, uh, I'll ask Mickhead.
28950	J.D.	Turk, you know what bothers me? Dr. Cox shows up to work drunk and we're all acting like nothing happened.
28951	Turk	I don't know, I kind of feel for the guy. Besides, I am way too excited. I start my orthopedic rotation today. It is going to be awesome.
28952	J.D.'s Narration	Turk was psyched because orthopedic surgeons are notoriously the most unemotional, jockish surgeons of all.He was finally going to have a boss he could connect with.
28953	Dr. Stone	Hey, guys, I'm Dr. Stone. I'm your new attending. All right, fellas, hands in.
28954	Todd	Yeah.
28955	Dr. Stone	Hmm..Mmm..
28956	Turk	Dr. Stone? Usually people put their hands in, someone says "Go get 'em" or "Whoo."
28957	Dr. Stone	No. No words yet. I want you all to get comfortable with the feeling of your brothers' hands on yours. You know, as surgeons, we're constantly opening people up and looking around, but have you ever stopped to open yourself up and look around?
28958	Todd	Whoa.
28959	Turk	Whoo.
28960	Jordan	Hey.
28961	Carla	Hi. How's he doing?
28962	Jordan	He's not talking and he's, you know...
28963	Carla	What?
28964	Jack	Daddy drinks a lot.
28965	Jordan	First complete sentence. Fantastic. Thanks for doing this.
28966	Carla	Hey, sunshine. You gonna at least say hello? Nothing? Listen. I know you keep blaming yourself for this, but you just can't. When my mom died I thought that because I was a nurse I should have been able to prevent it somehow. But over time, I realized that bad things are going to happen. And beating yourself up isn't going to help anyone.Oh, that's it, sweetie, come here. Come here.
28967	Todd	Nurse, I need you to help me to drain some fluid. But first we're gonna have to get to work on this patient.
28968	Turk	Todd? Take the scalpel and carve this into your arm: "No nurse will ever touch your dangle."
28969	Dr. Stone	Sh-sh-shhh, Christopher, come on.
28970	Turk	Oh.
28971	Dr. Stone	You know what? I think you're a little edgy because you're here on the sidelines. I know how that digs at you.
28972	Turk	Oh yeah.
28973	Dr. Stone	It digs at you right here. That's OK. What would you say if I said you could have that big knee reconstruction later? What would you say?
28974	Turk	Awesome?
28975	Dr. Stone	Ha! That it is! Yeah.
28976	Turk	Right! OK.
28977	Todd	Finished.
28978	Dr. Stone	People, let's just take a second here to think about what we just did. We fixed an elbow. Yeah. The last thing this man said to me before he went under was how much he enjoyed Sunday morning tennis. Right? And I think I think that's special. And we're special. This was special. Thank you.
28979	Turk	He actually said "I think that's pretty special." Then he got all emotional. How lame is that?
28980	J.D.	That's pretty lame.
28981	Turk	I'm just not into all of that sensitive, touchy-feely stuff.
28982	J.D.	Well, you hug me all the time.
28983	Turk	And even that took awhile. Remember the first time you tried to hug me?
28984	All	Yeah!
28985	J.D.	You're sports team's in the World Series!
28986	Turk	Ha! What a game!
28987	J.D.	A grand slam!
28988	Turk	With Dr. Stone it's different. We're not friends. What kind of guy gets all cuddly with a guy he just met? It's pathetic.
28989	Todd	Dude, that's a little harsh.
28990	Turk	Todd, how long have you been holding that button?
28991	Dr. Stone	Long enough for me to hear what you really think.
28992	Turk	Great. Is there another guy on this planet who's that sensitive?
28993	J.D.	OK, let it out. I got you. J.D.'s got you. Hold me tighter. Little too tight. There's a good spot.
28994	Keith	Elliot, why did I have to come?
28995	Elliot	Because we're a couple, Keith, we do things together.
28996	Keith	OK, uh, would it be OK if I moved? Uh, this couch is uncomfortable.
28997	Elliot	Mm. Go.Dr. Cox, I am not going to pretend to know what you're going through but believe me, I've had my experiences. Remember last year, when I put my malaria patient through that painful procedure even when everyone knew he was going to die anyway?
28998	Keith	You know what? I'm just gonna go sit in the bathroom.
28999	Elliot	Anyway, you know what I do when I'm having a really tough time getting through things?
29000	Elliot's Voiceover	I just leave the city, get into nature and just take stock of what's important. Just make sure you don't go to a popular parachute drop zone.
29001	Elliot	I don't know if it was the adrenaline rush or because I thought he was an angel but that's the fastest I've ever gone from meeting to kissing. Yep. True story.
29002	Patient	I'm just worried about this mole.
29003	Dr. Kim	It doesn't look cancerous. Eh, get in there and take your pants off.
29004	J.D.	You gonna go talk to Dr. Stone?
29005	Turk	Nah, it'll blow over. Plus, he's a surgeon, and surgeons don't hold grudges. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go scrub up. And by the way, your shift with Dr. Cox starts in ten minutes.
29006	J.D.'s Narration	Turk was right. Personal feelings shouldn't get in the way of a professional relationship. But they do.
29007	Turk	What do you say we rebuild that knee?
29008	Dr. Stone	Actually, Dr. Turk, I think I'm going to let Dr. Norman here take the lead on this one, OK?
29009	J.D.	Look, Carla, I have a real problem with what Dr. Cox did and I don't think I can go over there.
29010	Carla	I'm going to send somebody else over for you, OK? J.D. was supposed to come, but he, um...he he's not coming.
29011	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
29012	J.D.'s Narration	I couldn't really worry about bailing on Dr. Cox. The Stanleys' child was sick and I just spent the last twenty minutes asking them awkward questions to rule out the possibility of child abuse.
29013	Mrs. Stanley	Who would smother their own child?
29014	J.D.	You'd be surprised. There's something called Munchausen Syndrome, where a parent will intentionally harm their child to get some attention on themselves.
29015	Mrs. Stanley	I've never heard of that. Someone should do a public service announcement about it.
29016	J.D.'s Thoughts	Hmm, someone should.
29017	J.D.	You had a tough day at the office, so you come home, make yourself some dinner, smother your kids, pop in a movie, maybe have a drink. It's fun right? Wrong. Don't smother your kids.That problem would be gone forever.
29018	Carla	I am so mad at you!
29019	Elliot	Yeah, you big jerk!
29020	Carla	How could you stand up Dr. Cox?
29021	Elliot	Wait, is that what we came to yell at him for?
29022	Carla	Well, yeah. What did you think it was?
29023	Elliot	Oh, apparently J.D. told Mr. Catay in there that I'm throwing him some big birthday party. Yeah, so when he asked where the cake was, I totally panicked and I told him we all pitched in and got him a weekend in Vegas.
29024	Carla	What?
29025	Mr. Catay	Can I see Celine Dion?
29026	Elliot	Oh, anything you want, Mr. Catay! You're going halfsies with me on everything.
29027	Carla	I can't believe you didn't show up at Dr. Cox's. Do you have any idea who I had to send in your place?
29028	The Worthless Peons	Gray skies are gonna clear up,
29029	Ted	Put on a happy face,
29030	The Worthless Peons	A happy face, reach up and part the clouds and cheer up...
29031	Todd	Hey if you're not digging this, I've got a hundred jokes about these.
29032	The Worthless Peons	...sunshine all over the place, just put on a happy face! Yeah!
29033	J.D.	I'm just not down with the whole drinking and doctoring thing, OK? Excuse me.
29034	Turk	I'm never gonna get a good surgery on this rotation.
29035	J.D.	I can help you with Dr. Stone. He's one of my people. He's a sensy.
29036	Turk	What's a sensy?
29037	J.D.	It's short for sensitive guy. Our music is acoustic alternative. We marvel at fireflies. And when we help a drunk girl home from the bar, sure we cop a feel. A feel of her hair as we're pulling it back so she doesn't get any vomit in it.
29038	Turk	I'm having a weird med-school flashback. I think you held my hair back while I vomited.
29039	J.D.	I did! That was our last year! I didn't what you to get Jagermeister in your corn rows.
29040	Turk	My Latrell Sprewell phase.
29041	J.D.	Hockey?
29042	Turk	Basketball.
29043	J.D.	Dammit.
29044	Turk	What am I gonna do about Dr. Stone.
29045	J.D.	You're gonna cry in front of him.Laugh if you must, but it'll show him you have emotional depth and it will trigger a nurturing impulse inside him that we sensies can't resist.
29046	Turk	How the hell am I supposed to cry?
29047	Janitor	You need to cry, let's brainstorm. I could hit you over the head with a wrench. Or, I could stab you in the gut with a knife.Knife-wrench! Practical and safe.Waah! OH! Ohh! Oh boy. Ahh!
29048	J.D.	Anywho, don't worry about crying. I got this menthol from the pharmacy. I read online that actors in Hollyweird actors spray it in their eyes when they need to fake cry.
29049	Turk	Why do you have five of them?
29050	J.D.	Oh, I'm using it for the final death scene in my movie, Dr. Acula. Last night, my German financier, Hans, rest in peace, died on the Autobahn. So now I gotta shoot the whole thing on my cell phone.
29051	Jordan	Hello, Bob. No cheek kiss necessary.
29052	Dr. Kelso	Oh, good. I have pike-breath. So, uh, when was the last time I was here, '97? I know it's been awhile because Enid could still fit through that door. I shouldn't joke, she's very ill.
29053	Jordan	I'm gonna go take a shower.
29054	Dr. Kelso	Hello, Perry. I don't really know why I'm here, but Nurse Espinosa said if I didn't swing by, she would stop coming over to my house and giving instructions to my pool boy. He speaks perfect English, but he doesn't have an front teeth, so I can never look at him without laughing. Heh, heh, heh. Anyway, I don't know what she expects me to say to you. I mean, all you do is bust my ass day in and day out. I guess you you keep me in line on those rare occasions when I lose sight of things. You could say we balance each other out pretty well. Whew. Perry, the hospital needs you. I need you. What the hell are you doing?
29055	Keith	Did Elliot leave without telling me?
29056	Jordan	Why is there an intern in my bathroom? It's not my birthday.
29057	Keith	She made me watch.
29058	J.D.	OK, there he is. You ready?OW! He's the one who needs to cry, you idiot, not me!AAAHHH!!
29059	Janitor	Oh, yeah, I forgot all about that crying stuff. I was just...Oh, hey, loose thread.
29060	J.D.	No!
29061	Janitor	Got it. Knife-wrench! For kids.
29062	J.D.	OK, he's hugging Colonel Doctor, which means you got about seven seconds.
29063	Turk	A hug takes seven seconds?
29064	J.D.	A good one does. Here's the plan. What you're gonna do is tell him a story that isn't inherently sad. That way, when you get all emotional, he's gonna think you're extra sensitive. At which point, I'm gonna nail you with the menthol and you'll be crying like a ten year old pilgrim widow. Here he comes. And, blacktion.
29065	Turk	Dr. Stone.
29066	Dr. Stone	Christopher.
29067	Turk	Yeah, you know, I'm just out here thinking about my wife. She's pregnant with our first child.
29068	J.D.'s Thoughts	And, come on, fishy, take the bait.
29069	Dr. Stone	Children are pretty darn special. I have seven of my own and each one is just as compassionate as the next one. That is the quality that me and my six ex-wives try to instill in our children.
29070	Turk	It's overwhelming here.
29071	Dr. Stone	Exactly. You know, my new wife, Carol, she's four months pregnant.
29072	Turk	Congratulations.
29073	Dr. Stone	We're separated.
29074	Turk	Mmhmm.
29075	Dr. Stone	We are not so different, you and I.
29076	J.D.'s Thoughts	He's not a sensy. He's a nutjob.
29077	Dr. Stone	It's hug time, Chris. Come here.Whoa, whoa!
29078	Turk	Old habit.So, he has a mild concussion, and they're going to let him rest for awhile.
29079	J.D.	Good. That gives us time to come up with a new plan.
29080	Turk	Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. That's it. I'm done. There's no way he and I are going to have a relationship. Not unless I want to bear his seventeenth child.
29081	J.D.	He's your attending, you have to connect with him. You need somebody you can look up to. Someone you can count on. What you need is someone who will always have your back.
29082	Turk	No, J.D., that's what you need. That's what you've always needed. Maybe after five years of working here, that's not such a good thing anymore. I gotta go and do my shift with Dr. Cox.
29083	J.D.'s Narration	Right then I knew what I had to do.
29084	J.D.	Hey.
29085	Turk	What's up.
29086	J.D.	You're probably wondering why I didn't show up before, huh? I know you wanted me to, even though you'd never admit it. Normally I would kill to get into this apartment. And you try and keep me out. I say try, because at your Superbowl party, which I was not invited to, I was lucky enough to be able to watch the second half from right over there. I was the bearded Domino's employee you invited in because I said I was a fan of Jerome Bettis, who ever the hell that is. Anyway, I tried to convince myself the reason I didn't come earlier was because of you coming into work drunk. But that's not it. I was scared. I guess after all this time, I still think of you as like this superhero that will help me out of any situation I'm in. I needed that. But, that's my problem, you know? And I'll deal with that. I guess I came over here to tell you how proud of you I am. Not because you did the best you could for those patients. But because after 20 years of being a doctor, when things go badly, you still take it this hard. And I gotta tell you, man, I mean, that's the kind of doctor I want to be.
29087	J.D.'s Narration	Maybe he just needed time to heal, or maybe he just needed to see how much everybody cared but I like to think that it was because of me that he was finally able to say this.
29088	Dr. Cox	You don't drink scotch.
29089	J.D.	Ohhh, that's awful.
29090	Carla	Glad you finally shaved.
29091	J.D.'s Narration	That's the thing about family. When you fall off the deep end, you can always count on them to rally around you. When you come back, you might get a quick hug, a pat on the shoulder......Maybe just a nod.But no words really need to be spoken. Of course, it's always nice when they are.
29092	Dr. Cox	J.D....Thank you.
29093	J.D.	Welcome.
29094	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
29095	Dr. Cox	Look, one of the reasons interns have so much trouble putting in chest tubes is because it is a violent procedure. You must not be scared, though, children. You must use force to get the tube between the ribs and pop it through the pleura. What do you say there, Lis? You can do this.
29096	Keith	Uh, Dr. Cox, I'm not so sure I'm comfortable with this.
29097	Dr. Cox	Then you shouldn't have lost my teaching mannequin.
29098	Keith	I don't know what happened to it.
29099	Janitor	Hello, carpool lane! Ha ha ha! So what movie do you want to see?
29100	Lisa	Inserting chest tube. MM!
29101	Keith	GAAH! Lisa! God, he was joking!
29102	Dr. Cox	Yes, I was Lisa, now take the rest of the afternoon off and think about what you did here today.This is a warning, people. Anyone else who hurts Keith is going to get the exact same treatment as Lisa. Good day.
29103	Elliot	Nothing like having to watch your boyfriend get humiliated on a daily basis.
29104	Gloria	Purple Nurple!
29105	Carla	Baby, look at this. I'm starting to look like a big fat pregnant lady.
29106	Turk	No you're not, baby, you look like you just let yourself go a little.OK, that came out wrong, but baby, it's OK. You're just overreacting because your pregnancy hormones are totally taking over. It's fine. These past few days, your moods have changed like that!
29107	Carla	That is not true!
29108	Turk	It's cool.
29109	Carla	I'm sorry. Let me kiss the owie? Kiss the owie?Mmm. Oh, baby, I wanna do it right now.
29110	Turk	You don't want to do it right now, it will pass.
29111	Carla	This is happening.
29112	Turk	Damn right this is happening.
29113	Carla	My mom. I can't believe she'll never meet her grandchild.
29114	Turk	Do you want to start with kissing or should we just get right into the good stuff?
29115	Carla	What is wrong with you?!
29116	Turk	Oof! When will you learn?
29117	J.D.'s Thoughts	Hmm, Turk talking to a new staff member. Give her a treat and say hello.
29118	J.D.	Hello!
29119	Turk	J.D., I'm sure you know Kim Briggs.
29120	J.D.	Uh, no, you big knucklehead, I don't. On behalf of everyone here at Sacred Heart, I'd like to say konnichiwa.
29121	Kim	I've been here five years, big guy.
29122	J.D.	I know that, Kim. It's a game we play. What's your name? It's Turk. What's that guy's name? I don't know, he's a patient. Looks like a Dave. Are you a Dave? Maybe he's a Dave, we don't know. Hey!
29123	Kim	Torture him about this.
29124	Turk	Will do. Peace out!
29125	J.D.	How come I've never noticed her before?
29126	Turk	Oh, because she wears a wedding ring. Yeah, you don't notice women who wear wedding rings.
29127	Turk's Voiceover	Kim was here on your first day.She was at Ben's funeral.She's been around.
29128	J.D.	] Everybody was Kung-fu fighting! Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah!So you're saying because she wears a wedding ring she's invisible to me?
29129	Turk	Yes.
29130	J.D.	Please, T, I'm not that shallow.
29131	Turk	Oh, really? Will all the women in the room who are married, please remove your wedding rings?
29132	J.D.	Dr. Feinburg? Anastasia? Gift Shop Girl?
29133	Gift Shop Girl	Hey, J.D.
29134	J.D.	I thought you died.
29135	Gift Shop Girl	Nope. I just got married.
29136	J.D.	But I sent your family flowers.
29137	Gift Shop Girl	I know. You bought them from me. It was kind of weird.
29138	J.D.	Gift Shop Girl!
29139	Gift Shop Girl	What?Stop that!
29140	J.D.	Sorry.
29141	Kim	That's backwards. It's been bugging me for years.
29142	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
29143	Kim	How are we doing, Mr. Peters?
29144	J.D's Narration	I had checked up on Kim. She got along with everybody.
29145	J.D.'s Narration	All the guys liked her.
29146	Kim	Toughen up, sailors, chick on deck. I need a few more towels in the ladies' locker room.
29147	Todd	Oh, I got a towel for ya.YAH!
29148	Kim	Thanks, Todd.
29149	J.D.'s Narration	All the women liked her.
29150	Kim	I just love that every woman knows how to do that.
29151	J.D.'s Narration	She even got along with the greasers.
29152	Kim	Guys, I know everyone gives you a hard time, but trust me. This look is coming back.
29153	J.D.'s Thoughts	I never got a synchronized snap from the greasers.
29154	Kim	Mr. Peters, I know that having a gal urologist might seem a little uncomfortable, but the penis is just another excretory organ, so let's go ahead and take the stigma off it. Now this is the length of the average penis.
29155	J.D.'s Thoughts	WHAT?!
29156	Mr. Peters	That seems about right.
29157	Kim	Good for you! I was just messing with Dr. Dorian over there.
29158	J.D.	You know what? I'm not talking to any of you guys.You lieOh, my God.
29159	Elliot	Keith, I know we had plans tonight, but I am way too tired.
29160	Keith	No problem. I'll call you tomorrow.
29161	Jordan	Hey, girls. Listen, Perry got uppity with me for, and I quote, spending twenty thousand dollars we don't have on shoes. So I figured I'd get back him by treating everyone to drinks tonight.
29162	Elliot	I'll go.
29163	Carla	Elliot, you just told Keith you were too tired. What are you doing?
29164	Elliot	I, uh, I think Keith and I might be done.
29165	Carla	What?!
29166	Janitor	Hey, Dorian, let me borrow that pencil for a second. Just one second? Thank you.Oh no. I snap-a da pencil. What do you think? It's for my stand-up act.
29167	J.D.	Where do you perform?
29168	Janitor	I'm at the Giggle Pit. Every Monday at sunup.
29169	J.D.	Well, I'll have to come by sometime.
29170	Janitor	Do it, man.
29171	J.D.	No, wait a second, I'm mad at you! You stole my video camera with all the scenes on it from Dr. Acula, the vampire movie I'm making.
29172	Janitor	Why do you think I stole it?
29173	J.D.	I don't know, maybe I was surfing the hospital's website and I saw that someone posted the "Dr. Acula delivers a baby, then eats it" scene? Someone with the screen name "Rotinaj?" Rotinaj is just Janitor spelled backwards, Rotinaj.
29174	Janitor	Morning, Dr. Rotinaj.
29175	Dr. Rotinaj	Good morning, Mr. Clean-up man!
29176	Kim	Mr. Peters, I looked at your CT scan and I'm recommending that we don't do surgery.
29177	Mr. Peters	Great.
29178	Kim	This is goodbye for us, but I'm leaving you in the very capable hands of Dr. John D. Dorian. You take care.I gave you a new middle initial. It reassures me for some reason. In my mind, the D stands for Dallas because I just got finished telling Mr. Peters that's where I lost my virginity. Don't know how we got down that path, it's something about that old man that just makes me want to open up.
29179	J.D.	Hm.
29180	Kim	Anyway, I hope you don't mind your new middle initial.
29181	J.D.	I don't mind it a turtle's wink.
29182	J.D.'s Thoughts	Wait, you only pepper your conversations with cute animal imagery if you're smitten.
29183	Kim	Could you lend me your pen?
29184	J.D.	Quick as a porcupine's hiccup.
29185	J.D.'s Thoughts	All right, there's only one problem with this.
29186	Kim	OK. See you J.D.
29187	J.D.	Kim, wait. Unfortunately there's no way I can make you mine. Unless I make you mine...for eternity!
29188	Kim	Dr. Acula, don't....stop!
29189	J.D.	Vampires like it windy.
29190	Carla	Why are you breaking up with Keith?
29191	Elliot	Look, Keith is sweet. But after watching him get walked on again this morning, I feel like I need a stronger man in m life. I mean, I want what you guys have. Someone who will stand up for me when I really need it, you know? Someone as confident as Turk, or as brave as Dr. Cox, or as...I'm sorry, Laverne, I don't really know your husband. What are some of Mr. Roberts' good qualities?
29192	Laverne	Well, he was a roadie for Jimi Hendrix and when it rains, he carries me to the car.
29193	Elliot	And you guys have been together for what, 60 years?
29194	Laverne	I'm 48. And I'm done here.
29195	Elliot	Mm. My bad.
29196	Carla	I don't want Keith to go. Elliot, I don't want Keith to go.
29197	Jordan	Aww, there, there.What? I'm pregnant, I'm crying, I'm laughing. Enough already. It's boring.
29198	Dr. Kelso	Listen up, nametags. I need to wire some cash to my son so he can make bail. Apparently that musical he was making was just a front for a crystal meth lab. And here's the kicker. He fled to Toronto, so now the frickin' Mounties are involved. Anywho, I need someone to zip out to my house and grab $400.
29199	Janitor	I'll do it. I shouldn't be mopping in here anyway. This is a rug.
29200	J.D.	Don't let him in your house, sir. He'll steal everything you got, like he stole my video camera.
29201	Dr. Kelso	Do you know the difference between me and you, Dorian?
29202	J.D.	Your melon-size prostate, sir?
29203	Dr. Kelso	I will never fear this man. Do you think I'm afraid of you, chief?
29204	Janitor	No, sir, I do not.
29205	Dr. Kelso	Now look. I keep my extra cash in a pickle jar on the top shelf over the sink.Enid wants that jar so bad she can taste it. Oh, that's right. You don't remember that she's paralyzed and can't stand up out of her wheelchair. That's why you're not laughing.
29206	Dr. Cox	No, Bob. We're not laughing because we're all horrified.
29207	Dr. Kelso	Well, it tickles me.
29208	Dr. Cox	Eh.
29209	Turk	OK, honey, I know Elliot upset you with this whole Keith thing. But we're all gonna be extra extra sensitive so you don't get riled up, OK?
29210	Elliot	I'm wearing red. Should I not be wearing red around her?
29211	Turk	She's pregnant. She's not a bull.
29212	Elliot	I know you think I'm just being crazy, but Elliot, you should not give up on Keith. You say he's not strong enough for you because he keeps getting stepped on at work? That's what it's like for interns. You're just doing what we all do when we start to get serious in a relationship. You're freaking out and you're trying to poke holes in it. Remember when I first started dating Turk and I wanted to bail on him because he cried at the end of sex?
29213	Turk	Baby!
29214	J.D.	Relax, brown bear, there's no shame in cry-maxing.
29215	Carla	And you know how hard single life can be. Just ask Kim.
29216	J.D.	Wait, Kim's single?
29217	Elliot	Oh, yeah. She's been divorced for like, over a year. She just wears her ring at the hospital so she doesn't get hit on all the time.
29218	J.D.	Turk! Keys!Yahtzee!Hey, girl. What are you doing? Wanna get some coffee later?
29219	J.D.'s Narration	And then, the ultimate Cox block.
29220	Dr. Cox	Hey! Why isn't Mr. Peters in there getting surgery?
29221	Kim	I decided against it.
29222	J.D.	Yeah, she thought it would be best if I treated him medically.
29223	Dr. Cox	First of all, Newbie, nobody's ever thought that. Ever. Secondly, she's a cutter. When was the last time you met a cutter who didn't want to cut? Laverne? You've been here 40 years now. You ever heard of such a thing?
29224	Laverne	I'ma kill somebody.
29225	J.D.'s Narration	I guess we all get mad when people say things we don't want to hear.
29226	Carla	Elliot! I'm sorry, but I can't let you leave until you promise me you'll think about it with Keith.
29227	Elliot	Oh, my God, Carla. Will you please just butt out of this one?
29228	J.D.'s Narration	Especially when things feel a bit fishy.
29229	Janitor	Here's you cash.
29230	Dr. Kelso	Oh, thanks. Say, that's a new coat.
29231	Janitor	Yep, just picked it up.
29232	Dr. Kelso	Where'd you get the money to buy it?
29233	Janitor	Mmm, I don't think it's any business of yours.
29234	J.D.'s Narration	Still, it's always good to hear the truth.
29235	Dr. Cox	Surgery is really the only thing that has a shot at curing this guy and the reason that she's not going to do it is because he's older and he's got heart issues which makes him high-risk and if he were to drop dead on her operating table, well, that would make her surgery stats go down. And that wouldn't look very good on a young doctor's resume, would it?
29236	J.D.'s Narration	Even if it meant losing respect for someone you thought you might like.
29237	Kim	What can I say? You got me.
29238	J.D.'s Thoughts	Damn.
29239	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
29240	Greaser	Dr. Turk! I covered your gastric bypass patient last night and he left a message for you.
29241	Turk	What did he say?
29242	Greaser	You are square!
29243	Turk	Stupid greasers.
29244	J.D.	Oh, here comes Kim. She's had all night to think about what she did, so she'll probably be in a shame spiral. Let's enjoy it.
29245	Kim	Hey, fellas, how you livin'?
29246	Turk	Large! What!What, was I not supposed to answer?
29247	J.D.'s Narration	I wasn't the only one having relationship problems.
29248	Elliot	Sorry about the way I left last night. We're OK, right?
29249	Carla	Until you receive further notice, consider us not speaking.
29250	Dr. Kelso	I know you took my money to buy that ridiculous coat.
29251	Janitor	I bet you can't...prove it.
29252	Dr. Kelso	Enid, you are my eyewitness. Did he take more than $400? Is that a new pantsuit?You think you're pretty smart, don't you?
29253	Janitor	All I think is that leather never goes out of style. And if you're gonna keep your money in a pickle jar, you should probably know how much is in there. And that it never hurts to buy your invalid wife something nice, so maybe she can feel pretty. And these are general thoughts about life. Nothing specific to you.
29254	J.D.	Mmm, that was nice.
29255	Turk	That wasn't me.
29256	Kim	Hey, dudes.
29257	J.D.	Don't "Hey, dudes" us, you know what bothers me?
29258	Kim	Non-threatening, colloquial greetings?
29259	J.D.	It bothers me that a doctor wouldn't help a patient so she could keep her stats up.
29260	Turk	Yeah.
29261	Kim	Look, J.D., surgery is competitive. We do what we have to to get ahead.
29262	J.D.	Well, my best friend here is a surgeon and he would never pass on a risky surgery just to keep his stats up.
29263	Turk	Actually, I have done that. Everyone has.
29264	J.D.	Oh, my God. Out of here!Dr. Cox, please weigh in.
29265	Dr. Cox	Well, it's no secret how I feel about surgeons. I hate them. I would liken them to rocks, but that would be an insult to rocks, because you see, at least rocks are useful to society. We build bridges with them. We throw them at guys who wear those tiny phones clipped to their heads. It's a phone. You can't do this? However...
29266	J.D.	Now back to the crux of the matter! Hit her, Per!
29267	Dr. Cox	However, it is not Dr. Briggs' fault that she works in a broken system. Top hospitals are only interested in hiring surgeons who they think are flawless. Newbie, that's not the answer you thought you were gonna hear. But as always, I don't care.
29268	Kim	Thank God he didn't see this.Yeah, Mom, I was listening the whole time, I just couldn't talk.
29269	J.D.	RRRGH!
29270	Dr. Kelso	Looks like someone took their new titanium 8-iron with a leather grip and went to town on your van.
29271	Janitor	Well done, sir.
29272	Dr. Kelso	What, you think I did it?Too bad you can't prove it.
29273	Janitor	Really?
29274	J.D.	I think I need to take more...bloooood!
29275	Dr. Kelso	What the hell is this?
29276	Janitor	It's Dorian's camera. This must be a scene from Dr. Acula.
29277	Turk	You ain't takin' no more blood from my ho-slappin' hand. I will pimp slap you. This feels a little racist, J.D. Why can't I be a vampire?
29278	J.D.	Because it's my movie! Now let's take it from the top and I'm not gonna ask you again. Blacker.
29279	Turk	Blacker.
29280	J.D.	Yes, please.
29281	Turk	Blacker.
29282	Janitor	Now comes the good part.
29283	Dr. Kelso	Prove that! And that! And that! And that! AND THAT! Yeah!What do you want?
29284	Elliot	So hey, I thought you might be hungry. Did you enjoy the pancakes I left on your computer?
29285	Carla	No. But I enjoyed the 3000 ants crawling on my keyboard.
29286	Todd	There's two of them doing it on the "F" button. I could be wrong, but it looks like two girls.
29287	Carla	What do you want, Elliot?
29288	Elliot	I wanted to apologize.
29289	Carla	Well, save it.
29290	Elliot	Look, Carla, I...
29291	Carla	Honestly, you must be really bored with the friendship because all you do is take, take, take. And the most embarrassing thing is you don't even realize you're doing it. Because let's face it. At the end of the day, you're nothing but a spoiled, selfish, neurotic little girl from Connecticut who has absolutely no idea how to...
29292	Keith	Whoa, whoa, OK, that's enough! I don't know what you two are fighting about, but it doesn't matter. Because no one is allowed to be that mean to my girlfriend, especially when all she's trying to do is apologize! Are we clear?
29293	J.D.'s Narration	Nobody really speaks to Carla like that.
29294	Turk	It was really cool getting to know you, man.
29295	J.D.'s Narration	The irony was that Keith was yelling at the one woman who was trying to save his relationship.
29296	Carla	I'm sorry, Elliot.
29297	J.D.'s Narration	And even more ironic was that it looked like she had.
29298	Elliot	Thanks for standing up for me.
29299	Keith	Yeah, totally.
29300	J.D.'s Narration	I think Elliot finally seeing who Keith really was made me understand why I was so upset with Kim.
29301	Kim	Look who's happy again.
29302	J.D.	Yeah, well, it's just...
29303	Kim	J.D., one second, uh, I'm on the phone with my Mom.She just got her RV fixed. Mom, I gotta go. You can call me from the road.My mom loves the road.
29304	J.D.	I finally figured out what bothers me so much about you.
29305	Kim	Well, lay it on me, studly.
29306	J.D.	It's the way you're so concerned about protecting yourself. I mean, no one in this entire hospital has a bad thing to say about you, and I'm guessing that's because you're so careful not to rub anyone the wrong way. And you still wear your wedding ring. That prevents any guy from getting anywhere near you. You wouldn't operate on Mr. Peters, and we both know you're protecting yourself there. I don't know, I guess in the grand scheme of things, it's not that big a deal. I just I was a little disappointed to find out how you turned out to be. I'll see you around, Kim.
29307	Kim	See you...
29308	Dr. Kelso	I don't want to do this.
29309	Janitor	No problem. I'll just give the videotape to the police.
29310	Dr. Kelso	Ladies and gentlemen, this is your chief of medicine, Bob Kelso. I feel compelled to tell you that I do, in fact, fear the Janitor.Honestly, is there anyone else with such a brilliant mind?
29311	Elliot	You planned all this, didn't you? The whole being mean thing so that Keith would stand up for me. Oh, thanks.
29312	Turk	You didn't plan a damn thing, did you?
29313	Carla	No, I snapped like a twig.
29314	Turk	Yeah.
29315	Carla	Please don't tell her.
29316	J.D.	Who is Dr. Briggs operating on?
29317	Lisa	Your patient, Mr. Peters.
29318	Dr. Kelso	So, please join me...in basking in the glow of the Janitor's awesome...this isn't a word.
29319	Janitor	Read it.
29320	Dr. Kelso	Fearitude. Good night.
29321	Janitor	And good luck. I love that movie.
29322	J.D.	I saw you did that surgery on Mr. Peters. Did you decide it was the right thing to do?
29323	Kim	No, actually it was a stupid career risk.
29324	J.D.	Then why did you do it?
29325	Kim	Because for some reason, I find myself really caring about what you think of me.
29326	J.D.	Oh. Cool.
29327	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
29328	J.D.'s Narration	It's springtime at Sacred Heart and the whole hospital had that end of the year smell.
29329	J.D.	Gloria, I need you to change the dressing on Mr. Currans' wound.
29330	Gloria	And I need you to suck it.
29331	J.D.	Wow, Gloria, do you kiss your great, great, great, great, great grandkids with that mouth? Zoom, zoom, zoom! Ted, that's funny! Where's the chuckle?
29332	Ted	Bank foreclosed on my house.
29333	J.D.	Where's your mom?
29334	Ted	She's out in the car with the cats.
29335	J.D.'s Narration	Dr. Kelso celebrated spring by wearing his golf shorts to flaunt his oddly youthful legs.
29336	Dr. Kelso	Take 'em in, people. I shaved 'em for you.
29337	Jordan	Tell your daddy what you just did.
29338	Jack	I made poopy in the potty.
29339	Dr. Cox	You know, son, as a doctor I spend a lot of my day dealing with other people's poop and I'm not gonna lie to you, Jacky, it gets old. Now that's — that's not to say that I haven't enjoyed the last three years of waking up to a fresh brown trout in your Huggies. Besides, you're going to be doing the same thing for me someday real soon. And yet, aside from actually seeing you being born and that time Wayne Gretzky said "what's up" to me in line at the bank, you being out of diapers is the best damn thing that's ever happened to me. It truly is. Now why don't you go in your room and — and play for a little while, because your mom and I are gonna celebrate up here, grown-up style.
29340	Jordan	All right, let's get this over with. I need to take a nap. I've been exhausted all week.
29341	Dr. Cox	Yippee.
29342	Jordan	Uh-uh, no kissing! Hands behind your back! Let's go!
29343	J.D.'s Narration	Yup, love was definitely in the air.
29344	J.D.	Hey, Kim, how would you like a night on the town with the hottest doctor in this place?
29345	Kim	I'd rather just go out with you. Ohh! Zoom, zoom, zoom!
29346	J.D.	You zoom, zoom, zoom?
29347	Kim	Ha! Of course. I invented the zoom, zoom, zoom.
29348	J.D.	Oh, cool.
29349	J.D.'s Thoughts	Liar.
29350	Kim	So, Josh, you are suffering from a condition called phimosis. It's basically a hardening of your foreskin. As part of your treatment, I'm going to ask that you masturbate five times a week.
29351	J.D.'s Thoughts	Help the poor kid out.
29352	J.D.	Well, five times a week, huh? For me that would be cutting back.
29353	J.D.'s Thoughts	He said, in front of his future girlfriend.
29354	J.D.	You know what? I should probably mosey.Looking forward to our date.
29355	Kim	See you around six, wear something slutty. Zoom, zoom, zoom.
29356	J.D.	That's mine.
29357	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
29358	Carla	Eh? You like that?
29359	Todd	Wow. I felt it move.
29360	Carla	Todd, you're touching your crotch.
29361	Todd	I know, and I'm loving it.
29362	J.D.	Hey, Tubby.
29363	Carla	Oh, J.D., come here, I want to you to feel something, quick!
29364	J.D.	Ooh.OWWWW!!
29365	Carla	Don't call me Tubby.
29366	J.D.'s Thoughts	Pregnant witch. Hey, there's Kim. She and Elliot had bonded over their ability to communicate at the speed of light.You'd have to slow it down for humans to understand.
29367	Elliot	So the shower's gonna start at four, and there's gonna be baby games.
29368	Kim	You're such a good friend. You know, I got her a present, but since we're not close, I think I'm just gonna go home and get ready for my date.
29369	Elliot	Oh.
29370	Kim	Oh, hey, you! I'm psyched for tonight.
29371	Elliot	Ah, yes. The best thing about having a date with J.D. is that if you're having Chinese food and you decide you want Mexican, you can just walk right on to the other side of the food court.
29372	J.D.	We are not going the mall, Elliot. I was gonna make you dinner and then go to karaoke, but I'm not sure how to do both in the same night. Unless, of course...
29373	Elliot	J.D., not Floating Head Doctor.
29374	J.D.	Too late, I'm already there.
29375	J.D.'s Thoughts	Body could stay home and prepare the feast.And as always, Head could take care of entertainment.
29376	Kim	Don't go breaking my heart.
29377	J.D.'s Head	I couldn't if I tried.
29378	Kim & J.D.'s Head	Oh, honey, if I get restless...
29379	Kim	Stop hogging the mic!
29380	J.D.'s Head	Body, come!Stupid Body! I gotta do everything myself!Oooh, oooh, and nobody knows...Come with me, Come with me...
29381	J.D.	Head loves karaoke.
29382	Kim	Well, I'm up for anything. I married my high school boyfriend, so the only first date I ever went on was in tenth grade. I began with me sitting in the backseat of his Miata, because his friend, Benny, called shotgun. And it ends with us going to the arcade, and I quote, to eat pizza and beat up nerds. And I married that guy!
29383	J.D.	Well, trust me, Kim. I've beaten up many nerds in my day. But tonight's about you having the best first date ever.
29384	Kim	All right, slugger!
29385	J.D. & Elliot	Bye!
29386	Elliot	You don't have anything planned, do you?
29387	J.D.	You had to soil the whole food court thing. It's veal piccata night at Sbarro's!
29388	Elliot	Well, I'd help you out, but I'm planning a baby shower for Carla. I am going to make this cafeteria look totally different.Ted, what the hell?
29389	Ted	It's the only song we know with "baby" in it.
29390	Elliot	I want my money back.
29391	Crispin	What money?!
29392	Ted	What? I lost my house. Give me a break.
29393	Elliot	Fun, right? No one is mingling! And why are all the morgue guys so cliquey?
29394	Doug	I want yellow.
29395	Keith	I wish I had cool morgue friends. Hey guys!
29396	Carla	Oooooooh! Laverne, I didn't know you knit!
29397	Laverne	I sure do. Mr. Roberts doesn't have one pair of store-bought socks. I am going to knit you a muzzle.
29398	Dr. Cox	Those are all from us.
29399	Jordan	It's just Jack's old baby crap. We're really excited to get rid of all that stuff and watch you guys suffer through the hellish, relationship-ruining nightmare that is the baby phase.
29400	Carla	Aw.
29401	Jordan	Open something.
29402	Dr. Cox	G'head, g'head.Oh! Those are my workout pants.
29403	Jordan	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
29404	Dr. Cox	She's been trying to get rid of them, but I'll be honest with you. I love them because they're so darn comfortable, and boy, can you get 'em on real quick.
29405	Turk	Ah. You ain't lying!
29406	Dr. Cox	Ah.
29407	Turk	Baby, check it out. Bam, bam, biggida bam bam...
29408	Carla	Wonderful. Thank you.
29409	Keith	Why can't we just talk to people?
29410	Elliot	Because, Keith, this is the baby game station. Once we start playing, other people will join us. OK, guess what flavor baby food this is!
29411	Keith	Cab driver feet?
29412	Elliot	No, Keith! That's turnips! You got it wrong so you gotta finish the whole jar! You guys, this is so much fun!Ugh. Where the hell are all your intern friends?
29413	Dr. Kelso	Listen up, interns. Notice the definition in the upper calf. Look at it, dammit! See that? Back in Nam, the choppers would hover about eight feet over my head and I'd jump in. You should have seen the look on Charlie's face. Not the enemy, son, the pilot, Charlie Norse. Great guy. He didn't make it back. Where's the cake?
29414	Lisa	Eight feet? I don't believe it.
29415	Dr. Kelso	Uhhhh...AHH! Believe that, missy!
29416	J.D.	I have to get ready, man. I want my date with Kim to be perfect. What do you think about a romantic horseback ride on the beach?
29417	Turk	Ooh, like you and I did for your birthday.
29418	J.D.	Yeah, yeah, but except this time with two horses.
29419	Turk	Why not just take her to your deck? You can just lie out, look at the stars?
29420	J.D.	Unfortunately, I can't. My deck has sort of become a cruise-in spot for older, gay gentlemen.Get off my deck, you old queens! Go! HEY! Whose is this?!Whose is this? You find somewhere else to hang out! I know for a fact Les Mis is in town!I tried turning my hose on them, but they liked it.
29421	Turk	Well, if anything, good luck, buddy,
29422	J.D.'s Narration	I didn't need luck because this was going to be the most romantic date ever.
29423	J.D.	Your steed, m'lady.
29424	Kim	J.D.! I've never ridden a horse on the beach before!
29425	J.D.	Upsy-daisy.
29426	Kim	Wow, no saddles. Are you sure you're going to be OK riding bareback?
29427	J.D.	No problemo.
29428	J.D.'s Thoughts	What's so hard about riding bareback?
29429	Kim	Oh, that was amazing! Wasn't that so much fun?
29430	J.D.	Oh, yeah, it was awesome.
29431	Carla	Thank you! Is this for when we buy the baby a dog?
29432	Janitor	No. It's a baby cage! It's a good one, too. See, when I was a kid, mine didn't have these windows. It's perfect. If you want to go out to dinner, there's already, like, a water bottle in there. You just throw some cedar chips in there so the baby can poop and you're made in the shade.I'm kidding. It's for when they buy the baby a — a puppy.
29433	Everyone	Ohh! Ahh! Ohh!
29434	Elliot	Ooh! This one's from me and Keith! Oh, he'd be here but he's in the bathroom throwing up summer squash.
29435	Carla	Oooh!
29436	Elliot	It's a Preggy-Teddy. I got it over at that new maternity lingerie store at the mall. I had a very interesting conversation with the sweet old lady who owns the place. She said not very many pregnant women shop there. It's mostly just fat whores.
29437	Everyone	Oh.
29438	Laverne	I got to get me one of those.
29439	Dr. Cox	Say, Bobbo, do you wanna weigh in on pregnancy sex?
29440	Dr. Kelso	It's a freak show.
29441	Dr. Cox	You've seen an ultrasound? They have eyes, they have hands. How do you think they're going to react to an intruder?
29442	Dr. Kelso & Dr. Cox	UNH!
29443	Turk	The baby can't grab me down there. The baby can't grab me down there.
29444	Carla	No, baby.
29445	Kim	OK, I called an ambulance, but you should really let me examine you.
29446	J.D.	Oh, no, no, no. The date continues.
29447	Kim	J.D., I'm a urologist and there's a good chance you have testicular torsion. In which case, you could lose a testicle. So, come on. Off with the pants.
29448	J.D.	Looks like my plan is working.
29449	Kim	All right, testicular function is normal. OK, one is significantly larger than the other.
29450	J.D.	Actually, that's a preexisting condition.
29451	Kim	So the right one's always been bigger?
29452	J.D.	Yes. Wait, your right or stage right?
29453	Kim	Ugh, let me test the retraction.
29454	J.D.	Retract it.
29455	J.D.'s Thoughts	OK, the date's not going as planned, but you can still save it with your legendary gift for small talk.
29456	J.D.	So, you're from Texas, huh? They say that's the Lone Star State. What exactly does that mean?
29457	Jordan	My boobs are so big right now. Honestly, I think Dr. Fishman threw in a little something extra when he did my chin.
29458	Dr. Cox	Would you — would like to see something really just beautiful?
29459	Jordan	Mmm.
29460	Dr. Cox	There goes all of Jacky-boy's baby stuff.
29461	Janitor	No, Mom! Playpen/baby-cage is not like tomato-tomahto!
29462	Kim	J.D., I hope you're not beating yourself up about this.
29463	J.D.	Oh, Kim, I'm sorry. I wanted to something fun for our first date.
29464	Kim	No, it was so much more fun than you might think. I mean the first seven or eight minutes rocked! Admittedly, it was a little more like work after that, but at least I got to third base with you.
29465	J.D.'s Narration	And there it was. The moment where pity was turning into genuine affection. Classic Dorian.
29466	J.D.	I feel like we kinda missed first base.
29467	Kim	Me too.
29468	J.D.	Well, maybe we should fix that.
29469	Kim	We should.
29470	J.D.'s Narration	And then it happened. Elliot Reid: Moment Killer.
29471	Elliot	What's up, guys? Tell me every detail about the first date.
29472	Kim	We were horseback riding on the beach.
29473	Elliot	Ah, yes, I've been on that date.
29474	Kim	Really?
29475	J.D.	What? I had a coupon.
29476	J.D.'s Narration	I wasn't the only one to have an uninvited guest.
29477	Jordan	Agh, you know what sucks? I didn't eat any of that crappy shower food and I still feel nauseous. In fact, I've been nauseous for like, two weeks.I've been exhausted all week.My boobs are so big right now.Yup. I'm pregnant.
29478	Jack	I pooped in my bed, so I put it on the TV.
29479	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
29480	Dr. Cox	Please forgive me, but since I had a vasectomy last year, nay, two vasectomies, I feel — I feel I just have to ask. Did you cheat on me?
29481	Jordan	No. And you know me. I always tell.
29482	Dr. Cox	Well, that's true. That's pretty much why we work well together.
29483	J.D.	Are you responsible for this?
29484	Janitor	What are you talking about? I'm selling my old mop. The 2007's are in.
29485	J.D.	Sorry.
29486	Turk	All right. There she is. We spent all morning crafting a line so raw with confidence, that if you pull it off you're back in the game.
29487	J.D.	I'm afraid, mocha bear.
29488	Turk	I know. Buck up.
29489	J.D.	Hey, Kim.
29490	Kim	Oh, hey, J.D., how are you feeling?
29491	J.D.	Well, uh, the swelling's gone down... for now.
29492	Kim	You're an idiot! Ha ha ha!
29493	J.D.	Go out with me again tonight.
29494	Kim	Oh, J.D., I would love to, but I'm going to a Neil Diamond concert.
29495	J.D.	With who?
29496	J.D.'s Narration	Elliot Reid: Moment Killer.
29497	Elliot	What's up?
29498	Kim	Oh, hey girl.
29499	Elliot	Are so you psyched?
29500	Kim	I'm so psyched.
29501	Elliot	Me too.
29502	Turk	Everywhere around the world, they're coming to America.
29503	Dr. Cox	Could I, uh, could I have everybody's attention please? Jordan's pregnant.
29504	Elliot	Oh, you get over here, you!
29505	Jordan	Not a hug moment, sweetie.
29506	Elliot	Right. Yes. No.
29507	Dr. Cox	Mm.But, Dr. Cox, here I thought you and Jordan were done trying to have any more babies.We were, but my vasectomy didn't take, which apparently is not that uncommon.Holy crap, Dr. Cox. That must have really pissed you off.Yes, it did, actually. What is — what is your name?Oh, I'm any generic hospital worker who happens to ask you a question about your pregnancy and/or baby related issues.Oh, isn't that nice. You're done.This morality play was made possible by a generous grant from the Just See If I Was Kidding Foundation.
29508	Carla	Do you wanna do it or should I?
29509	Turk	Let's just do it together, all right?
29510	Turk & Carla	MAAHAAA!!
29511	Dr. Kelso	That's from the Simpsons.
29512	Elliot	Ahh.
29513	Turk	I'm gonna have a heart attack.
29514	Carla	Did you guys hear what Jordan and Dr. Cox did to the guy doctor who botched his vasectomy?
29515	Jordan	Go, Ted.
29516	Dr. Fulton	Don't they ever say ribs?
29517	Dr. Cox	Never. They never say ribs.
29518	Turk	I heard ten minutes into it, he started eating his own face.
29519	Carla	He did.
29520	Elliot	Well, you know what J.D.'s got planned since it's his day off and he's dateless?
29521	J.D.	This is my first scooter rally. Do you want to be Paunch or John?
29522	Carla	I can imagine what Jordan and Dr. Cox are feeling right now.
29523	Jordan	Do you really think we can handle this?
29524	Dr. Cox	I don't know.
29525	Elliot's Voiceover	I can totally picture J.D., too.
29526	J.D.	Oh, hey, Mom. No, I'm just hanging out alone tonight. I just didn't really have anything else to do.
29527	Carla	We want to give you your stuff back.
29528	Dr. Cox	We don't feel like dealing with that stuff right now.
29529	Turk	How about now?
29530	Dr. Cox	Mm. Come on in.
29531	Carla	Hmm.
29532	J.D.'s Thoughts	Ugh, I hate cleaning up after those messy, old queens.Ooh, appletini. When did they start drinking straight-guy drinks? Mmm. It's fresh.
29533	Kim	What's up, chicken butt?
29534	J.D.	Hey, Kim. What happened to Neil Diamond?
29535	Elliot	I haven't seen Keith in a while, so I'm gonna take him instead. Kim's letting me off the hook.
29536	J.D.	Thank you.
29537	Elliot	You're welcome.
29538	J.D.	What's up?
29539	Kim	Nothing.
29540	J.D.'s Narration	It seems like good friends always come through for you.
29541	Turk	You like it?
29542	Dr. Cox	Yeah, I like it. I can wear 'em out to dinner. With a sports jacket?
29543	Jordan	No.
29544	Dr. Cox	Oh.
29545	Carla	It's OK, don't get up, I got it. Uhh!
29546	Turk	OK.
29547	Carla	It's only your child. Look. I feel like I can give you a list of things that are sucky about being pregnant. For starters, I am now horny as I've ever been and my husband is repulsed by me.
29548	Turk	Listen, if you really need it that badly, I will suck it up and shut my eyes so tight and then do you.
29549	Carla	Thank you for the sacrifice.
29550	Turk	It's because I love you.
29551	Carla	My point is, even with all that crap, I'm sure it's all been worth it. I've seen how happy having Jack has made you two. And yeah, I know it's been hard, but I know that neither one of you regret any of it.
29552	Turk	What the hell is this thing?
29553	Dr. Cox	That's Jack's mobile. Actually, it's his third mobile. The first two were deeply embedded in the drywall. They can be quite frustrating to assemble.
29554	Jordan	Do you remember when he was teething and he would stare at that thing for hours?
29555	Dr. Cox	Yep.
29556	Turk	Why does your TV smell like doodoo?
29557	J.D.	So what do you want to do tonight?
29558	Kim	Why don't we just hang here and look at the stars until we're comfortable to make out a little?
29559	J.D.	OK. I'm cool with that.
29560	Kim	Not yet.
29561	J.D.	OK, you let me know.
29562	J.D.'s Narration	And like that, I felt like all was right with the couples in the world.
29563	Kim	OK, now.
29564	J.D.'s Narration	And right then, I knew this was the start of something important.

29573	Dr. Cox	You love spaghetti. You had some just last night, didn't ya?
29574	Jack	No, I didn't!
29575	Dr. Cox	Jordan, the boy is lying to me.
29576	Jordan	Oh, Perry, nobody likes a tattle-tail!

29580	Turk	Yo, Elliot...what's your ringtone?
29581	Elliot	"Jesus, Take the Wheel" by Carrie Underwood.
29582	Todd	I'm carrying underwood right now. See, that's funny because it's true. Please?
29583	Elliot	But that's all you get for the rest of the year, Todd.
29584	Turk	I'm downloading 'N Sync's "Bye Bye Bye." When that bad boy starts a-jumpin', I defy anyone not to shake their butt to it. I'm bringing it back.
29585	Elliot	Just like you brought back Pop-Rocks?
29586	Turk	Teddy boy!
29587	Elliot	Yeah, well, you're not as big a trend-setter as you think you are. Right, Keith?Ohh.
29588	J.D.'s Narration	As for me, I spent my free time getting coworkers I just met pregnant.
29589	J.D.	You're pregnant? Are you sure?
29590	Kim	I'm pretty sure.
29591	J.D.	Uh, Kim, I'm not really sure how to phrase this, so I'm just gonna dive right in: Have there been other penises?
29592	Kim	It's yours, J.D.
29593	J.D.	Cool.
29594	Kim	Are you okay?
29595	J.D.'s Thoughts	Aaaaauuuuugggggghhhhhh!!!!!!
29596	J.D.	Yeah. I don't think I've ever seen the inside of your apartment before.
29597	Kim	Said the father of my unborn child. Heh!
29598	J.D.	Well, that's different, Kim, that's hilarious. This is life-changing.
29599	Kim	We can get through this.
29600	J.D.	You know what else is pretty classic when the coffee guy asks for money, you say, "Sorry, my wallet's in my other pair of mocha-chinos." That always gets 'em.
29601	Kim	Ah, dammit. I have to go to the hospital.
29602	J.D.	Scone is also a a funny word; but I don't like them, I prefer croissants.
29603	Kim	You're clearly freaking out, so, um, you need to promise me that you're gonna find somebody to talk to about this while I'm gone.
29604	J.D.	Please! I'll be fine. You be careful you're walking for two!Call Turk.
29605	Elliot	You were right, Turk.
29606	Turk	Hell, yeah!
29607	Dr. Kelso	All right! All right! Now listen! This is a hospital, not a discotheque! Turn that damn thing off!
29608	J.D.	Come on, buddy. Please pick up.
29609	Dr. Kelso	This is pretty catchy.
29610	All	Awwwwww!
29611	J.D.'s Thoughts	No problem. I'll just go chill at my deck with a little vino.
29612	J.D.'s Narration	Unfortunately, it was still a hangout spot for gay seniors.
29613	J.D.	All right! That's enough! I have seen Les Mis over a dozen times, so I have nothing against giant queens per se, all right? In fact, my life would be a whole lot easier if I was married to one of you guys.... Excuse me.
29614	Queen	You heard him, girls. Let's roll!
29615	Gays	Yeah! Wooo!
29616	Turk	Hold up! Hold up! Hold up! "Las Vegas Police Department." Hello?
29617	J.D.	Why didn't you answer your phone when I called you?

29624	J.D.	Ted, please!Ted!Okay, I'll see you at lunch.
29625	Janitor	Hey, mojambo. This here's our new flagpole. Why don't you show Old Glory a little respect and snap off a salute?
29626	J.D.	There's no flag up there.
29627	Janitor	We're at war, my friend. All American flags are on backorder. What do you want me to do in the meantime, run a pirate flag up there? Maybe turn the whole building into a pirate ship? I could put a captain's wheel up on the roof...catch a parrot somehow...slap on an eyepatch...go to work with a caulk-gun, seal her up, make her watertight I can take her out to sea.
29628	J.D.	Are you insane?
29629	Janitor	Nah. I'm a pirate.

29635	Turk	Coincidentally, I have a cousin named Shadaisy!
29636	Dr. Cox	What?
29637	Carla	J.D. needs us right now, okay? So this is what we're gonna do: Dr. Cox, you're backing off. Elliot, you go talk to him.
29638	Elliot	Can't wait to talk to J.D. Maybe we can chat about how everyone in this frickin' hospital, other than me, is having a baby. I mean, seriously, having a baby, having a baby, having a second baby! Or having her husband's best friend's baby! That's right, Mona, everyone knows!

29641	Dr. Cox	Gather round, doomed new interns who just paged me! Quick question: What does this outfit tell you?
29642	Dr. Kelso	You...are entering a Joe Piscopo look-alike contest?
29643	Dr. Cox	It means that I was just working out which, incidentally, is the last remaining activity I have in my adult life that qualifies as "me time." Other activities recently crossed off of that list include my morning dump and all showers. You see, my dear son Jack has decided that those are team sports. However, I'm here, and I'm totally psyched to hear whatever the super-de-duper reason is that you paged me.
29644	Male Intern	Mr. White's chart said to remove his eight stitches, but we counted nine. Should we leave one?
29645	Dr. Cox	That's it. Every single one of you is gonna run laps around the hallways until I say stop.Think I'm kidding? Shyah! Shyah! Shyah shyah shyah! Shyah!
29646	Jordan	Perry? What the hell? I just got a call from Jack's school. Apparently they served spaghetti for lunch, so he had some sort of Vietnam flashback.
29647	Dr. Cox	I don't have any anger issues.
29648	Female Intern	Dr. Cox, I'm sorry, but my asthma...is really...starting...to....

29653	Janitor	New ways to torture that guy. See?
29654	J.D.	Mrs. Zeebee, I know that we were hoping that the pain around your areola was simple mastitis, but it turns out that it's breast cancer.
29655	Mrs. ZeeBee	I can't believe this is happening to me.
29656	J.D.	Trust me, I know what you're going through. Just yesterday, I found out that my girlfriend
29657	Turk	'Scuse us!Dude, please tell me you're not comparing getting cancer to knocking up your girlfriend.
29658	J.D.	I was trying to!
29659	Turk	You can't pawn your personal stuff off on your patients!
29660	J.D.	What about you and the motorcycle accident guy!?
29661	Turk	So get this: My pregnant wife has decided that it's okay to steal my pillow in the middle of the night and sleep with it in between her legs!
29662	Patient	When am I going in to surgery?
29663	Turk	Oh, we can't start the surgery until the troopers find your foot.That was different. He said, "What's up?"

29665	Dr. Cox	Hardly seems like much of a punishment for the kid from Kenya. I mean, God's sake, he could run all day.
29666	Carla	You know, maybe Jordan's right maybe it's time you start dealing with your anger issues?
29667	Dr. Cox	Carla, for something to be an issue, it needs to cause a problem. I mean, honestly, aside from having to by law remain thirty feet away from a certain telemarketer who I visited while he was eating his dinner, I don't see the downside.
29668	Carla	Mr. Slydell here is suffering from peptic ulcer disease and hypertension two conditions you'll often see in very angry people.
29669	Dr. Cox	Now, now, you don't know that this gentleman is angry.
29670	Mr. Slydell	Damn it! Why won't this TV go on!?!?
29671	Carla	That was the bed remote.

29673	Keith	Ted, I...I got the cola. Did you get the Pop Rocks?

29675	Keith	Sure we should do this?
29676	Ted	I'm sick of legends and hearsay, Keith! I have to know!
29677	Janitor	No scuffing. No scuffing!
29678	Mr. O'Neil	But if it doesn't work, you'll just be an older, fairly ugly, janitor woman.
29679	Janitor	That's true.
29680	Mr. O'Neil	You know, you and I are quite a bit alike. I spent most of my life trying to become a lawyer. But I could never get my juris doctorate.
29681	Janitor	How does that make us alike?
29682	Mr. O'Neil	Ohh, I spent years trying to get that damn J.D....

29689	Nurse	Dr. Briggs? Why are you crying?
29690	Kim	This song always gets me.My brother was killed by a funky cold medina.
29691	Carla	I'm sorry, J.D., but you knew that this could happen when you had sex.
29692	J.D.	I have to tell you guys something, but you have to promise not to laugh, okay?
29693	Carla	Oh, no, absolutely.
29694	Turk	I'll try.
29695	Elliot	Right. Sure.
29696	J.D.	Okay, on the night of said conception, uh, Kim and I nuded up, and um...the dirty talk began, and I got a little over-excited.
29697	Turk	Ooooh! She like-a the dirty talk!
29698	J.D.	No, I do. I find it gets the ladies going, but I occasionally get wrapped up in it myself, especially when I use some of my different voices....
29699	Elliot	He does.
29700	J.D.	Anyhoo, there was some unexpected friendly fire. And, uh, even though I never got a chance to enter..."the village"...uh, there was a..."airstrike" on one of the outlying regions
29701	Turk	Thank you.
29702	J.D.	Anyway, I spoke to the gals up in OB-G, and they said it's not uncommon for a woman to get pregnant even if there was no actual penetration.
29703	Turk	What you trying to tell us is that you...never actually had sex with her?
29704	J.D.	No, I didn't have a condom.And, uh, we decided not to have sex because here's the kicker I didn't want to get her pregnant.
29705	Turk	Oh, no you didn't!
29706	J.D.'s Narration	As I thought about how Mrs. Zeebee and I had gotten such a raw deal, I realized how easy it was for doctors to see themselves in their patients.Whether it's in the choices they made in their life...
29707	Mr. Slydell	My anger not only cost me my health, it also cost me my job, my marriage...it cost me damn near everything.
29708	Dr. Cox	You're killing me.
29709	J.D.'s Narration	...or the choices they didn't make...
29710	Mr. O'Neil	I was so obsessed with getting my J.D. that I never did the things I really wanted to do start a family, see the world....
29711	Janitor	Punch a whale?
29712	Mr. O'Neil	No, I punched a whale, right in the face. Down he went, like Liston.
29713	J.D.'s Narration	Either way, it forces you to face your problems head-on.

29735	Dr. Cox	What kind of new crazy is this?
29736	Carla	Oh, Elliot snapped a little and decided the interns were her babies.
29737	Elliot	Oops, Jakie. Somebody's got a little smudgie on his face. There you go.

29739	Carla	Um, why doesn't Elliot have a freshly-ripped new one right now?
29740	Dr. Cox	I'm not freshly ripping anybody anything anymore. I am done with anger.
29741	Jordan	Oh, is that gonna be like the time you quit drinking? 'Cause that was the longest twenty minutes of my life!

29747	Dr. Kelso	You've never been to Paris and cleaned a French toilet, huh?
29748	Janitor	Oh! Haha, good one. No, that's not it. Come on, be straight with me. Do you think I'm wasting my life?
29749	Dr. Kelso	Let's cut to the chase, freak-show. If you're a 44-year-old man wearing a jumpsuit and you are not climbing into the cockpit of a rocket ship, chances are you've made a lot of wrong turns along the way. Good talk!

29754	Turk	You're right! That'll work. But still, you need to man up and talk to her.
29755	J.D.	You have no idea what I'm going through.
29756	Turk	Really? 'Cause the last time I checked, I was having a kid, too.
29757	J.D.	Yeah, that you planned with your wife, whose middle name you know.
29758	Turk	I knew it was something Puerto Rican.
29759	J.D.	What if Kim and I don't end up together? Okay? I already have enough trouble meeting girls. Can you imagine it now? "Hey, how you doin'? I'm J.D., and this little bugger right here already hates ya for not being his real mommy! Wanna get freaky? I'm apparently very fertile!"

29764	Dr. Cox	Oh. Hi, interns.
29765	Interns	Hi.
29766	Dr. Cox	Look, you pretty obviously have short-circuited. Because the odds of you ever actually having a baby are roughly on a par with me finding the Loch Ness monster in my bathtub.

29768	Dr. Cox	Okay, ahaho!Hi, honey!Hyah! Go on, get outta here! Come on! You too! Get outta here! Hyah!
29769	Carla	Mr. Slydell's ulcer perforated and he bled out. He's dead.
29770	Turk	Well, if it isn't my beautiful bride, Carla Juanita Espinosa.
29771	Carla	Juanita? You think my middle name is Juanita?
29772	Turk	I am going to kill J.D.!
29773	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
29774	Dr. Kelso	Uh, Dr. Dorian, look, uh, this is a bit awkward, but, uh, as chief of medicine, I feel obligated to ask you about your relationship with Dr. Briggs.... Was she naughty? I bet she's a hellcat.
29775	J.D.	Get help, sir.
29776	Dr. Kelso	Never mind. It's, uh, better up here.
29777	Nurse Roberts	Mrs. Zeebee's CAT-scan came back.
29778	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, man. This just sucks.
29779	J.D.	Mrs. Zeebee, unfortunately the cancer isn't localized just to your breast. We're gonna have to start chemo right away.
29780	J.D.'s Narration	The most important thing to remember when you see yourself in a patient is that they're not actually you.In fact, sometimes, they're actually who we wish we had the courage to be.
29781	Mrs. Zeebee	You know what? I'm gonna get through this. Just you watch.
29782	J.D.	Yeah.
29783	J.D.'s Narration	Right then, I knew exactly what I had to do, come hell or high water.
29784	J.D.	Whoa! Oof!
29785	Turk	Uh-huh! I got your Juanita. Juanita, huh? Well you can Jua-nita this right there.
29786	J.D.	What the hell?
29787	Janitor	It's now or never.
29788	J.D.	Are you gonna let me down anytime soon?
29789	Janitor	Not until you spend a little time acting like a flag.
29790	J.D.'s Narration	As I acted like a flag, I sensed that the Janitor learned nothing from this experience.Dr. Cox, on the other hand, got halfway there. He may always be angry at work, but he had learned to control himself when it counts.
29791	Dr. Cox	Jacky, would you like some hot dogs?
29792	Jack	I don't want hot dogs!
29793	Dr. Cox	That's okay, 'cause we've got your favorite yogurt.
29794	J.D.'s Narration	As for me, I finally came through, even if it was a little late.
29795	J.D.	Can we talk?
29796	Kim	That'd be great.
29797	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
29798	Jack	You're a fatty fatty fatty fatty fatty fatty fatty fatty fatty!
29799	Woman	What's your son doing?
29800	Dr. Cox	Apparently he's doing the "fatty dance." Inappropriate? Well, maybe. But I'm raising my son to be a straight-shooter. That's his mom, right over there.
29801	Jordan	Ohh, thanks for including me.
29802	J.D.'s Narration	Dr. Cox and Jordan weren't the only ones with kid troubles. My brand new girlfriend was pregnant, and we were trying to decide what to do.
29803	J.D.	Should we keep it or get rid of it?
29804	Kim	I dunno. If we keep it, it'll just end up in the dumpster.
29805	J.D.	You're right.
29806	Kim	So, uh, let's go.... Um.... Do you like kids?
29807	J.D.	Of course I do! What about you? Any nieces or nephews?
29808	Kim	Yeah, I have a nephew. Although he's forty-five. But occasionally I do have to change his diaper he was kicked by a horse.
29809	J.D.	Oh, no!
29810	Kim	Yeah.
29811	Old J.D.	So beautiful! I hope you keep some ice in this locket, 'cause you're making me hot all over!
29812	Girl	Actually, it's the only picture I have of my biological father. D'you wanna see it?
29813	Old J.D.	What? Oh! Sure! Uh, I'll take a look at it first thing tomorrow morning, huh?
29814	J.D.	Yeah, I'm not a big fan of adoption.
29815	Kim	You think if it's a girl, you'd doink her?
29816	J.D.	I know I will.
29817	Kim	Yep. All right, well, look, we don't need to make this decision tonight, right? I mean, plenty of time.
29818	J.D.	I'm totally fine with stalling.
29819	Kim	Great! 'Cause if I hear the word "baby" one more time, I'm gonna lose it!
29820	Turk	Dude! Carla's in labor! Meet me at the apartment! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!Is he coming? Is he coming!?
29821	Elliot	Turk, she's barely in labor.
29822	Carla	Oh, he's not talking about the baby.
29823	Turk	He's here! And now we can have our baby!
29824	J.D.	Okay, Brown Bear, commence Operation Brown Cub! Suitcase!
29825	Turk	Check.
29826	J.D.	Stylish big daddy hat!
29827	Turk	Check.
29828	J.D.	Big-time collegiate drum-line!
29829	Turk	Check!I want the whole world to know my baby's having a baby!
29830	Carla	Maybe we should just take your car!
29831	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
29832	J.D.	'Kay, ladies, we're here; calm down.
29833	Carla	What the hell took you so long? Oh, my God, did you stop for food?
29834	Turk	We had to, honey. J.D. promised the band that we'd feed them.
29835	J.D.	Yeah, let me get twenty-three cheeseburgers, twenty-three milkshakes Miguel, if you don't stop drumming, you're not getting fries.Miguel has such raw talent, but his attitude keeps getting in the way.
29836	Elliot	Unbelievable.
29837	Dr. Cox	Yay, congratulations, whoopee, all right, see ya.
29838	Jordan	Eh eh eh eh eh. Heh heh.We are so happy for you!
29839	Subtitle	I'm a helicopter, I'm a helicopter, I'm a helicopter.
29840	Kim	He's so sweet!
29841	Jordan	Mm.
29842	Kim	You put one of those inside me! What are we gonna do?
29843	Carla	Turk, you brought my suitcase, right?
29844	Turk	Of course I have your suitcase, honey.
29845	J.D.	What are you doing?
29846	Turk	Sometimes when you need a miracle, you have to pray extra-extra hard. You wanna help me out?
29847	J.D.	Fo' shizzle.
29848	Turk	Please, Lord.Nothing! Okay.
29849	Carla	Turk! What the hell?
29850	Elliot	It's okay. It's okay, Carla, because I packed you an extra overnight bag, and you're all checked in, and I got you an orderly to take you to your room.
29851	Jordan	Yeah, I'm only four months pregnant, ace.
29852	Carla	Oh, yeah, I think you're looking for me.
29853	Jordan	Move it along before I eat you! Chop chop.
29854	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
29855	Dr. Cox	Ah. Sorry, Jack, the machine's broken. Looks like you're gonna have to guzzle your juice down without any ice. Pretend, um.... You know, pretend it's gin.
29856	Jack	What's gin?
29857	Dr. Cox	Gin is an alcoholic beverage which, if your mommy's strong genes are any indication, you'll eventually learn to love as it slowly destroys a giant portion of your adult life.
29858	Jordan	First the fat lady, now this? He's three, Perry! Do you have to be so blunt with him?
29859	Dr. Cox	I'm not gonna B.S. my own kid. What's the big deal?
29860	Dr. Kelso	Hiya, sport!
29861	Jack	Your skin is wrinkly.
29862	Dr. Kelso	Yeah? Well that shirt you're wearing is gay!
29863	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
29864	Turk	Hey, baby. I know things haven't exactly gone smoothly so far, but I promise you I'm about to make it up to you. I spent all weekend talking to my cousin who just so happens to be the world's biggest blerd.
29865	Elliot	Ohhh.
29866	Turk	Anyway, he taught me everything about streaming video; and now, thanks to me, your sisters in Chicago will be able to witness the birth of our child live via webcam!
29867	Carla	Turk! That's so sweet!
29868	Turk	You know, I do what I do.
29869	Carla	Camera man? Nuh-uh! No man's gonna me filming my pooter unless he's completely asexual!
29870	Ted	Hello!
29871	Carla	Oh! Hey, Ted! Cool.
29872	Turk	All right. I'ma go tell your sisters that this bad boy is about to pop off.
29873	Dr. Matthews	All right, Carla. Let's check how dilated you are.
29874	Ted	Looking real good, Carla. Okay, we're live in three, two, one....
29875	Dr. Matthews	Okay. Looks like you're at about three centimeters.
29876	Todd	Greatest show ever!
29877	Dr. Kelso	And...record.
29878	Janitor	Cool! Swamp thing!
29879	Jack	What's that, daddy?
29880	Dr. Cox	Oh, that's the vagina of a 35-year-old Latina woman.
29881	Turk	Baby?
29882	Carla	What the!?!?
29883	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
29884	Kim	J.D., we have to talk about all of our pregnancy options, even if they make us uncomfortable. There's one way of dealing with this that no one's mention yet.... The A-word.
29885	J.D.	I know....Appletinis
29886	Kim	Abortions.What?
29887	J.D.	I thought that we could discuss abortion over appletinis.
29888	Nurse Roberts	Did somebody just say "abortion"?
29889	Kim	Laverne, with all due respect, this is none of your business. Or Jesus's.
29890	Nurse Roberts	I believe He would beg to differ.
29891	Jesus	She's right, J.D. Every life is precious.
29892	J.D.	But what if having this baby is a huge mistake for us?
29893	Jesus	Okay, I'm gonna make this real simple: No abortions, okay?
29894	J.D.	But what if
29895	Jesus	No abortions!
29896	J.D.	Lemme finish! What if the parents were like abusive drug addicts who would neglect their kids?
29897	Jesus	Oh, well, in that case it'd be okay.
29898	J.D.	Really?
29899	Jesus	NO ABORTIONS! How are you not getting this!?
29900	Kim	This sucks. I mean, the hardest decision I've had to make in the last year was what hairstyle to get. And even then, all I did was open up an US Magazine, close my eyes and pick a random celebrity.
29901	J.D.	Kirsten Dunst?
29902	Kim	Owen Wilson.
29903	J.D.	Ohhh!
29904	Kim	Yeah.You know what's making this so hard? This relationship is so new, we can't tell if we have a chance of making this work long-term.
29905	J.D.	You know what might give us an inkling? We haven't technically had sex yet. That might help us find out if we're on the same page...you know...in the boudoir.
29906	Kim	Are you hitting on me?
29907	J.D.	I'm sorry, I'm being an idiot, aren't I.
29908	Kim	Nope. Clothes off. We're doing it.
29909	J.D.	Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...!...Yeah!
29910	Kim	That's that's exactly what we should do we should make a list of pros and cons.
29911	Jesus	What did you two just do? Because I sure don't see any wedding rings!
29912	J.D.	Laverne? Is this your Jesus?
29913	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
29914	Todd	Turk, I got your shift covered so you could hang here. Oh, and Carla, there's something I wanted to tell you.... Oh: Great vagina!
29915	Turk	So helpful!
29916	Carla	Don't take it out on The Todd! He was just giving me a compliment! Thank you, Todd.
29917	Todd	Hey, happy to say it.
29918	Carla	So what's next, Turk? Because so far, I'm half deaf from a drum-line, I have no suitcase, and the entire hospital has seen Miss Priscilla!
29919	Elliot	Oh, my God! So did I! Mr. Hebbler.
29920	Carla	Ew.
29921	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
29922	Kim	Okay, let me just read the last of the cons: We're not married, we're both totally focused on our careers, babies are known to be sticky, and the average cost of raising a child is four-hundred-thousand dollars.
29923	J.D.	Okay. Here are the final pros: Kids are great
29924	Kim	Yes.
29925	J.D.	we both make good money
29926	Kim	Yes.
29927	J.D.	your boobs'll get huge
29928	Kim	True.
29929	J.D.	I can finally buy Beanie Babies without feeling weird, and kids are great!
29930	Kim	Which we already said.
29931	J.D.	Tax deductions!
29932	Kim	Ohhh! Nice one!
29933	J.D.	Ohhh! Yeah! That's some
29934	Kim	All right, so then what's the final tally?
29935	J.D.	Nice. Let's see, that's twenty cons and nineteen pros. I guess we gotta abort.
29936	Kim	Yep.
29937	J.D.	Wait, I'm sorry. That's an eyelash, I made a wish. It's a tie abortion's off.
29938	Kim	Okay, so now what?
29939	J.D.'s Narration	Every couple has its share of problems.
29940	Jordan	Congrats, Perry. My son just asked me if my vagina had ever been on television.
29941	Dr. Cox	And did you tell him not since the late 'eighties when you were trying to make it as "an actress"?
29942	J.D.'s Narration	Whether it's someone digging in...
29943	Jordan	Will you just cut the crap and stop treating your son like he's your drinking buddy?
29944	Dr. Cox	Look, I'm not going to change who I am, all right? End o' story.
29945	J.D.'s Narration	...or someone stealing your thunder.
29946	Elliot	Okay, candles are all lit lavender scented, your favorite. And here's a picture of your mom to watch over you . And then I've got this kit in case you want to bronze the umbilical cord and use it for a keychain. I practiced at home on some calamari.
29947	Carla	Elliot, you're amazing.
29948	Turk	We hey, is there anything I can do to help?
29949	Carla	Elliot's got everything covered.
29950	J.D.'s Narration	Still, nothing's worse than facing the biggest decision of your life and not getting anywhere.
29951	Kim	Don't you wish it was this easy head's yes, tail's no.
29952	J.D.	You don't see that every day.
29953	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
29954	Kim	You know what? We're getting nowhere. Let's split up for an hour and do some soul-searching.
29955	J.D.	Where're you going?
29956	Kim	Oh, I was just gonna walk around.
29957	J.D.	All right, Justin. What should my specialty be, oncology or radiology?I go someplace wonderful.
29958	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
29959	Jordan	Anyway, I was thinking we need new table linens for the dining room. Well, not so much table linens as placemats. What do think's prettier, burgundy or mauve?
29960	Dr. Kelso	What the hell's with her?
29961	Dr. Cox	She's mad. But she can't give me the silent treatment because she knows I'd actually love that, so she's giving me the talk-until-I-want-to-commit-suicide treatment.
29962	Dr. Kelso	Sucks to be you.
29963	Dr. Cox	You have no idea.
29964	Jordan	...What else do I need for that? Oh, I need new pillow shams. And I I like cotton, but I think we should get a cotton blend because that's easier to clean, and I hate ironing. Maybe we need a new housekeeper. Maybe the housekeeper should come every single day now.
29965	Turk	Look, Elliot, I'm really trying to be involved in the birth of my child, but you just keep boxing me out.
29966	Elliot	That is not true. Now, outta my way I've gotta order the birth announcements, put in the carseat, and find a yard to bury the placenta.
29967	Keith	It's true. Sometimes she makes me wear a diaper.
29968	Elliot	Keith! Private!
29969	J.D.	So what is Elliot's plan?
29970	Turk	Ah, it's really simple: See, when Carla says "I'm thirsty," Elliot'll say, "Oh no, I forgot the ice chips." That's when I walk in, ice in hand, and I say, "Christopher Turk, at your cervix!"
29971	J.D.	Ahh! Should I have a baby, too?
29972	Turk	You know, I'm a little preoccupied right now. Why don't you ask your unicorn?
29973	J.D.	Ah, this is way over Justin's head. He's never been in love. Not real love, anyway.
29974	Turk	What's up with the ice?
29975	Kim	I don't know what to do. I mean, having a baby can completely ruin your life, you know? Not to mention, as a urologist, I have seen what childbirth can do to you down there. Heh. I mean, I examined this one woman last month and it was like "Hello...hello...hello...hello..."
29976	Carla	Not a good time, Kim!
29977	Elliot	Really? Uh.... Unfortunately...I forgot the ice chips.
29978	Turk	Dude, help! I'm totally stuck!
29979	J.D.	Why don't you just yank it out?
29980	Leonard	I would not do that.
29981	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
29982	Elliot	Ice chips! Ice chips! Ice ice! Chips chips!
29983	Keith	Hey, guys. Carla, let me just see how far you can reach here. Okay, perfect. Turk would like you to call him because he's stuck in an ice machine.
29984	Carla	What?!?!
29985	Keith	See, that's why I took the precaution. Heh.
29986	Carla	Kim, would you be a sweetie and give Turk a call for me?
29987	Kim	Yes, ma'am.
29988	Turk	Hey, baby, look, I ... Yeah, he he's right here. ... Hold on.
29989	J.D.	Hi. ... Yes, I know he missed your wedding, too. ... All right, hold on.
29990	Turk	Go.
29991	Janitor	Relax, I'll have him out in one second.
29992	Turk	NOOO!
29993	Janitor	He's being unreasonable. ... Okay.
29994	Turk	Aaaaaggghhh!Oh!
29995	Janitor	That was from me.
29996	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
29997	J.D.	Hey there.
29998	Kim	Hey.
29999	J.D.	So...you decided what you wanna do?
30000	Kim	Okay.
30001	J.D.	One, two, three.
30002	Kim	I got nothing.
30003	J.D.	Appletinis.
30004	Jordan	So, you guys gonna keep it?
30005	Kim	Um, maybe...we well, if we do we can then we...maybe not.
30006	J.D.	Um, we don't prob well, there's a lot to con because we'll probably...maybe not.
30007	Jordan	You know, I had an abortion.
30008	Dr. Cox	All right, Jacky, as promised, let's go find ourselves a li'l stethoscope so you can hear what your butt sounds like.
30009	Jack	Daddy, what's an abortion?
30010	Jordan	Enjoy.
30011	Jack	My mommy had an abortion. My mommy had an abortion. My mommy had an abortion. My mommy had an abortion
30012	Dr. Cox	How you doin'?
30013	Jack	My mommy had an abortion...
30014	Elliot	Okay, Janitor, Carla's starting to push tell Turk.
30015	Janitor	Got it. Your baby has a tail.
30016	Turk	I told her to stay away from the microwave.
30017	Carla	Ahhh! Elliot, I can't do it!
30018	Elliot	Okay, okay. I want you to imagine that your uterus is like a tube of toothpaste, and you're just trying to squeeze out all that minty fresh gel. But instead of minty fresh gel inside, there's a little black baby.
30019	Dr. Matthews	We have a prolapsed umbilical cord. She needs a C-section right now.
30020	Carla	Put Turk on the phone, dammit!
30021	Elliot	It's okay!
30022	Carla	Baby! Listen. I'm not angry that you got stuck I know you were just trying to be nice, because you're a good-hearted, wonderful, thoughtful man. But listen to me: They're giving me a C-section, and I'm really scared. And I need you to be here right now!
30023	Janitor	Something about a C-section. Smile!
30024	Turk	Almost there.
30025	Janitor	Almost there.
30026	Turk	Baby! I'm here!
30027	Carla	Turk! I'm scared!
30028	Nurse	Sorry, Dr. Turk. No ice machines.
30029	Turk	Noo!

30031	Jordan	I was nineteen and working on Nantucket as a waitress, and dating this amazing guy named Andy...with curly blond hair and dimples and eyes that were either sky blue...powder blue I could never figure out which.... Anyway, his best friend, Curt, knocked me up.
30032	J.D.	Oh, we're not judging you.
30033	J.D.'s Thoughts	Whore!
30034	Jordan	I think about it from time to time, but it would have been the biggest mistake to have that baby.
30035	Kim	We've talked, we've made lists, and we've been as logical as we can here, and we've still got nothin'.
30036	Jordan	It's not a logical decision. If it's right, you'll feel it in your heart.
30037	J.D.	Yeah, but what if we don't feel anything?
30038	Jordan	Maybe that's your answer.
30039	J.D.	Carla's having a C-section.
30040	Dr. Cox	Jordan, you...you okay?
30041	Jack	My mommy had an abortion.
30042	Jordan	She sure did, sweetie. How are my boys?

30044	J.D.	What's going on?
30045	Turk	They're about to start.
30046	Dr. Kelso	Turkleton! If you are trying to get the same five million dollar settlement that damn hook-handed security guard got, you're outta luck, stud. Because I put a little release button right here on top.
30047	Turk	Waaaaagggghhhh!
30048	Dr. Kelso	Well, what are you waiting for, son? Get in there.
30049	Turk	How you doin', beautiful?
30050	Carla	Turk, you're here...! I'm so hot....
30051	Turk	Oh, don't sweat it. I got ya.
30052	Carla	Aaaahhhhh....
30053	Elliot	Guys. I have an announcement.
30054	J.D.	Miguel, please!
30055	Elliot	The baby's out, but the cord was wrapped around its neck, so...we had to take it to the NICU.
30056	J.D.'s Narration	They say you never realize your capacity to love until you have a child. It can change who you are...
30057	Jack	Where do babies come from?
30058	Dr. Cox	"Where do babies come from?" Well.... When a mommy and a daddy love each other very, very much, sometimes they close their eyes...and they make a wish.
30059	J.D.'s Narration	...they can fill you with joy...
30060	Turk	Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce you to Isabella Turk.
30061	J.D.'s Narration	...it can even give your heart the answer you thought you'd never find.
30062	J.D.	Let's do this.

30064	J.D.s Narration	It was a day of discovery. I discovered that I could sex my pregnant girlfriend into a coma.
30065	J.D.s Thoughts	Nice!
30066	J.D.s Narration	Carla discovered that her baby wasn't the only one who loved breast feeding.
30067	Carla	Ohhh, are you hungry, sweetie?
30068	Todd	I could eat.
30069	J.D.s Narration	Dr. Kelso discovered change was not always welcome.
30070	Dr. Cox	A coffee place in a hospital? What's next, Bob, an ice cream parlor in the morgue? Admittedly not a horrible idea, seeing as the freezers are already down there, plus it'll be a perfect place for kids one of our famous vanilla malteds definitely takes the sting out of having to identify the freshly charred remains of your father!
30071	Dr. Kelso	Nobody else seems to mind.
30072	Ted	I should'a worn sunblock.
30073	Darth Vader	Did you get tickets yet?
30074	Dr. Mickhead	Ah! Another one!
30075	Ted	Awwwww. Now I'm at the end of both lines.
30076	J.D.s Narration	Still, the best discovery was learning that someone I drummed out of medicine had landed on his feet.
30077	J.D.	Frontsies!
30078	Jason	Hey, Dr. D.
30079	J.D.	Mmm. That's what we call "Cabbage-tastic."
30080	Jason	Oh, I love this job I screw up, nobody gets hurt. Except Cindy.
30081	J.D.	Eww. How about a second of that dynamite ape impression.I'm sorry, Cindy, once he's in monkey mode, you can't stop him. But who would want to, right? Cheers.Hey, Kim! Just checkin' to see if your socks are back on, since I knocked 'em off last night! Helloooooo!
30082	Turk	And so is this: Way to hit that, player!
30083	J.D.	Right? Zoom
30084	Turk	Zoom
30085	J.D.	Zoooom!
30086	Turk	So sorry.
30087	Kim	Relax, it's just sex. We should be able to talk about it.
30088	Turk	I'm not telling Isabella she's got a vagina till she turns eighteen.
30089	Kim	That's gonna be an awkward birthday party.
30090	Turk	Do not tell my daughter she has a vagina! I'm serious! Hm!? Hm!? Hmm!?!
30091	J.D.	It may have already come up.
30092	Elliot	Kim, uh, J.D. tells us that you're looking around town for a new job?
30093	Kim	Yeah, I just don't think the department head here is ever gonna promote me.
30094	Elliot	Why?
30095	Kim	Dr. Lemke! You're gonna love this. We're a husband and wife piano playing team, only I have no hands!With my head!
30096	J.D.	How great is that!
30097	Dr. Lemke	This is my wife, Sally. She lost her thumbs last month when our pet Komodo dragon, Morty, got out of his cage.
30098	J.D.	On the bright side, you have beautiful nubs.
30099	Dr. Cox	A tip jar. Really? So what am I supposed to do, just duke you my change because you poured hot water through beans? Well, I'll tell you what, my friend, unless you're also planning on giving me a complimentary reach-around with my beverage, I'm afraid the answer is yeah...no! Here's a here's a novel idea: Why don't you go fetch me a very large cup of coffee with so damn many fake sugars in it, that the coffee itself gets cancer.
30100	Elliot	Guys, guys, I got a good one. Is it me, or does
30101	All	"...someone need to switch to decaf?"
30102	Turk	Lay off of Elliot. She doesn't watch as much old TV as we do.
30103	Elliot	You actually stood up for me! But, now I'm forced to ask
30104	All	"...who are you? And what have you done with Turk?"
30105	Elliot	STOP FINISHING MY AWESOME JOKES!
30106	J.D.	Oh, my God!
30107	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
30108	Ted	She's so beautiful. Can I hold her?
30109	Carla	That's up to Turk. He's kinda paranoid about people dropping her.
30110	Turk	Yeah, you got decent hands. Go ahead.
30111	J.D.	I get her first because we're best friends. Elliot. Ted, give it!
30112	Elliot	Ooh, I'm next.
30113	Turk	You drop everything.
30114	Elliot	When do I Besides now. Look, come on, it is a human life I'll focus. Give it to me! Right here!
30115	J.D.	So, Carla, how much time do you think you'll take off?
30116	Carla	Ohhh, look at this little angel. I may never go back to work.
30117	‘‘Todd	I heard suckling.
30118	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
30119	Elliot	So, you're having chest pains, Mr. Turner.
30120	Dr. Turner	Actually, it's Dr. Turner.
30121	Elliot	You look like someone I used to date. I had a brief older guy jones, but now I'm with someone more age-appropriate and I'm like, Eww, what was I thinking?
30122	Dr. Turner	Mm. We are disgusting.
30123	Elliot	Yeah, but for some reason I was curious. Anyhoo, uh, we'll just run the usual tests.
30124	Dr. Turner	Sounds good.
30125	Elliot	Dr. Turner seems like a nice guy. And he's hot you know, like if...you left Brad Pitt out in the sun forever.... Stop it, Elliot! It took you months to get over that old man fetish!
30126	Dr. Cox	Blondie! He is private practice. Those guys are cocky jackasses who don't give two shakes about anybody else's opinion but their own. They're...they're me, with one addendum: They're whores. And I'm not talking about the good kind of whores like my ex-wife. They're whores for money.
30127	Elliot	Is that a tip jar?
30128	Dr. Cox	Look...I'm figurin' if those lumps down at the coffee shop can have one, I can, too. Listen to me. You may like Turner right now, but he is a doctor, and doctors make terrible patients sooner or later, they all try to treat themselves.
30129	Dr. Kelso	Perry, a quick word
30130	Dr. Cox	Bobbo! No time! Gotta go tell Mr. Clancy that his tumor is benign. Is that not exciting? Should be worth a finski whatta ya think?
30131	Dr. Kelso	Where the hell did you all come from?
30132	Janitor	Sneak attack. You can put your shoes on again, guys. Nice work.
30133	Dr. Kelso	I do not want to hear any more about a college scholarship fund. Stop filling your children's heads with nonsense! Pull them out of high school and teach them a trade like plumbing or undertaking!
30134	Janitor	None of us here even have kids, except for Margo, and she sold hers.
30135	Dr. Kelso	Dental is for old people. You young bucks have years before you have to worry about your choppers.
30136	Janitor	One, two... Ahhh!
30137	Dr. Kelso	Lovely. No.
30138	Janitor	Aw.
30139	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
30140	J.D.	Man, we got smoked. That's what we get for playing a bunch of Gs from the 'hood.
30141	Turk	Those guys are Indian.
30142	J.D.	So "Rajesh" isn't one of those cool black homely names like "Anforny"?
30143	Turk	No, "Rajesh" is like "Steve" in India.
30144	J.D.	Ohh!
30145	Turk	Yeah.
30146	J.D.	You always buy me a cotton candy after the game to celebrate my good sportsmanship.
30147	Turk	Yeah, well, you know what? I can't be buying you stuff all the time!
30148	J.D.	Yeah, well, I'm very close to a tantrum.
30149	Vijay	Could you guys look at my shoulder? I tweaked it pretty good.
30150	J.D.	Come on, Vijay, first you dunk on me and yell, "Who's your bitch!" now you want free medical advice?
30151	Vijay	I'll give you twenty bucks.
30152	J.D.	I'm sorry, my friend, but that's just not ethical.
30153	Turk	Done and done!
30154	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
30155	Elliot	Uh, heh, who's the new guy?
30156	Dr. Turner	Oh, this is Dr. Kershnar from my practice. Elliot Reid, I was telling you about. Give her a wave. Atta boy.
30157	Elliot	Look, as a doctor, I know that you're gonna be tempted to wanna treat yourself, and I just want you to know that's not gonna fly with me.
30158	Dr. Turner	Understood.
30159	Elliot	Great. Now, I believe that surgery on your abdominal aortic aneurysm's gonna be too aggressive I'd like to start you on twenty-five grams of Lopressor.
30160	Dr. Turner	Don't you mean twenty-five milligrams?
30161	Elliot	There! See? You're already trying to treat yourself! That was a test.
30162	Dr. Turner	But twenty-five grams would kill me.
30163	Elliot	I know. But i-i-it's still a test.
30164	Dr. Turner	Fine. From now on, you're the doctor.
30165	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
30166	Vijay	Ahh!
30167	Turk	All right, relax, you're fine. Just ice it when you get home.
30168	J.D.	Put that away, Turk! That's back-alley money!
30169	Turk	Relax!
30170	Cotton Candy Vendor	Hey. I'll give you twenty bucks if you check out my rash.
30171	J.D.	I'm sorry, cotton candy man, but unlike my friend, here, I have no interest in being sued for Do I smell blue?
30172	Cotton Candy Vendor	Just added the dye.
30173	J.D.	Ohhhhh! You crafty, crafty man that is fluffing up nicely. Hey, give me some money, I'm jonesing for some c-squared.
30174	Turk	Oh, you don't want my back-alley money, do you?
30175	J.D.	You heartless bastard. All right, let's see your disgusting rash.
30176	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
30177	Dr. Kelso	I'd like to see the blueberry again.
30178	Jason	I've a non-fat latte with room for Schnapps for Janitor?
30179	Janitor	Yep, thank you.
30180	Jason	Yeah.
30181	Janitor	You're not worried about, uh, spider monkeys?
30182	Jason	Spider monkeys?
30183	Janitor	Spider monkeys see intricate metal work as a display of dominance. It's a threat to them they'd tear your eyes out.
30184	Jason	Well, I'm just psyched this place is paying for 'em.
30185	Janitor	You get dental?
30186	Jason	Mm-hmm.
30187	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
30188	Elliot	Hmm...so, uh, Dr. Turner said that I am a very talented young physician.
30189	Dr. Cox	Jordan said I'm the only man she ever wants to have sex with!
30190	Elliot	Oohhh.
30191	Dr. Cox	Aren't we sharing fantastic lies we choose to believe for personal reasons?
30192	Elliot	He's actually a very deferential patient. Instead of surgery, I'm treating his AAA with drugs.
30193	Dr. Cox	D'oh! Thank you! Dr. Chatterbox there scheduled him for...surgery.
30194	Elliot	What the hell, Kersh!
30195	J.D.	I don't care if we had extra coffee money left over I don't feel right taking that guy's cash.
30196	Turk	Dude, stop stressing. See you later.
30197	Dr. Kelso	Is anybody planning on emptying that?
30198	J.D.s Thoughts	Sometimes everything you need to know is on the side of a coffee cup.
30199	Janitor	Greetings, customer! What can I get you?
30200	J.D.s Thoughts	"...they may deceive you..."
30201	Dr. Cox	And here we are. Even though Kershnar's signature is on the chart, this is the gentleman who ordered the surgery.
30202	Elliot	No, he didn't. Tell him.
30203	Dr. Turner	What would you like me to say?
30204	Dr. Cox	I'm just gonna go ahead and tip myself for calling this one! Thank you, me!
30205	J.D.s Thoughts	"In the end, those same people will make you wish you'd never met them."Maybe that wasn't just a rash on cotton candy man.
30206	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
30207	J.D.s Narration	I didn't tell Kim about how I most likely ruined my career by misdiagnosing the cotton candy man. I don't like to be a burden to the people I care about.
30208	J.D.	Turk. I need you, and I need you now.
30209	Carla	Isabella, this is the man you'll be competing with for your father's love.
30210	J.D.	Goochie-goochie-goo. Turk. Now.
30211	Turk	Babe, he's using his emergency tone.
30212	Carla	Go ahead. I have to feed her anyway.
30213	‘‘Todd	Formula's bad for the baby. Boob milk's healthier!
30214	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
30215	J.D.	His rash is probably purpura from disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, and I missed it, Turk. I'm screwed!
30216	Turk	He's gone.
30217	J.D.	Ohhh. I hope it wasn't the corn-dog guy. They never got along.
30218	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
30219	Elliot	Look, Dr. Turner, you're older, you're not in the best health I really think that this surgery could kill you.
30220	Dr. Turner	Are they gonna come in and shave me soon?
30221	Elliot	I'm still your primary physician.
30222	Dr. Turner	No, Kershnar's my lead now.
30223	Dr. Kershnar	I think surgery is the right choice.
30224	Elliot	Did you give him cue cards?
30225	Dr. Turner	That way he gets it exactly right.
30226	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
30227	Dr. Kelso	You don't scare me. Eventually, you will all come crawling back. Now, how about somebody gets me a banana-nut muffin, and hold the spit, please.
30228	Janitor	As manager, I reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.
30229	Dr. Kelso	Manager? You have worked here one day.
30230	Janitor	Corporate loved my ingenuity. I was saying, the two most addictive substances on earth are caffeine and... nicotine! Behold. Smokachino! For Kyle. Kyle! Smokachino for Kyle! Enjoy that.
30231	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
30232	J.D.	I feel like I dodged a bullet. Trust me, Brown Bear, you don't want this hanging over your head. Find Vijay and give him his twenty bucks back.
30233	Turk	Yeah, but then I'd have to give the money back to all the others.
30234	J.D.	Are you crazy? You could get sued! Secondly, I can't believe you went to the mall without me I specifically told you I needed to buy loafers.
30235	Turk	Well, I don't see you giving the money back to cotton candy man!
30236	J.D.	As a matter of fact, I already did.
30237	Doug	A twenty! Score!
30238	Turk	All right, I earned that money, and I'm not giving it back, and there's nothing you can do to make me.
30239	Carla	Give those people their money back!
30240	Turk	I can't believe you told!
30241	J.D.	Turk, we're doctors. We live by a moral code.

30244	Dr. Cox	Giant coffee.
30245	Janitor	Saw you coming. Here's your vente drip.
30246	Dr. Cox	You know what I'll take one of those.
30247	Janitor	It's a sale.
30248	Elliot	You know the worst thing about Turner's surgery? I'm gonna be right, but...he's gonna die. It'll be a hollow victory.
30249	Dr. Cox	If I got to be right and have a private practice doctor die due to his own idiocy, I would call that a pretty full victory.
30250	Dr. Kelso	Banana-nut muffin, please.
30251	Jason	Sir, I've been told not to serve you.
30252	Muffin	Hey, just take me. What are they gonna do, put you in jail? You're Bob Kelso! Just grab me and run! Do it!

30257	Turk	J.D., what the hell! I'm a surgeon that coulda hit my hand!
30258	J.D.	Why are you being so weird lately? You won't loan me money for cotton candy, you're charging strangers for medical advice, and now you're worried about your hand? Who are you?
30259	All	"...and what did you do with Turk?"
30260	J.D.	Great work, everybody! Thank you!
30261	Turk	You saw what happened yesterday.
30262	Carla	Ohhh, look at this little angel. I may never go back to work.

30269	Dr. Cox	Ah, when it comes to torturing you, everybody's on the same page.
30270	Dr. Turner	You know, Reid, you had the cojones to stand up to me, unlike Kershnar, whom I've so demoralized he's basically my trained chimp.
30271	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
30272	Dr. Cox	Easy, buddy. That smell burning your nostrils isn't just the baby throw-up on her jacket
30273	Elliot	Oh, uh, I got to hold Isabella. She squirted out of my arms, but Carla caught her.
30274	Dr. Cox	it's the smell of a doctor with integrity.
30275	Dr. Turner	Also, you'll never have to answer to this guy again.
30276	Turk	Wow, I got a family.
30277	J.D.	I know. In seven months, I'm gonna have a family, too.
30278	Turk	J.D., for the last time, nothing happened.
30279	J.D.	Please, this isn't about that. It's just that I looked all over, I never found any balloons. You'd think there'd be some balloons.
30280	Turk	I look at Isabella, and I get really scared. And I'm gonna need you to be there to help me through this.
30281	J.D.	Well that sucks, 'cause I was counting on you to make it look easy so I know I can handle it when my turn comes.
30282	Turk	Awesome.
30283	J.D.	Turk, you're at the beginning of your career. You know you're gonna make plenty of money.
30284	Turk	It's good to hear that from you, thank you.
30285	J.D.	You're gonna be just fine.
30286	Turk	I suppose so.
30287	J.D.	...Totally fine.
30288	Turk	Yeah.
30289	J.D.	Would you mind telling me that I'm gonna be fine, Turk? Am I gonna be fine? I think I'm gonna be fine!
30290	Turk	Well, I would, but I don't know how much you like Kim.
30291	J.D.	I really like her.

30298	J.D.s Narration	As for me, I was just excited to have the opportunity to get to know the mother of my child better.
30299	Kim	I got offered a new job.
30300	J.D.	Cool! Is it over at County? 'Cause that way I can drop you off every morning.
30301	Kim	It's in Tacoma, Washington.

30304	J.D.'s narration	To make more cash, sacred heart had started catering to rich folk, hence the swanky new suites.
30305	J.D.	Oh, not now.Never. He's in a coma.
30306	J.D.'s narration	Not only were the new suites super expensive, they were absolutely ruing my figure.Turk and Carla had just brought their new baby home.
30307	Turk	What's up, isabella? For your 16th birthday, your dad has made you a videotape. Now, I know future me is probably really strict, so no dating, no make-up, and no spending spring break with your friends on Mars. Last thing i need to worry about is my daughter getting eaten by a giant space slug. Know what I'm sayin'? Anyway, for your 16th birthday, my gift to you is to show you how happy your mom was the day we brought you home.
30308	Carla	Baby? I can't do this. We have to take her back.
30309	Turk	Happy birthday, sweetheart. We'll talk later.
30310	J.D.'s narration	As for me, my pregnant girlfriend just moved away, but I was still keeping things spicy.
30311	J.D.	Oh, of course I miss you, baby! Want to see a picture of me missing you? Hold on. Oh, thanks. Do you want to see a picture of my rock-hard abs? Ok, hold on. No, no, I've always had an innie. She wants to see a picture of my ass.
30312	Keith	Oh, J.D., I don't want -
30313	J.D.	I am your superior! what the ?Oh, hey, Elliot, I'll have him back to you in one second.

30316	Keith	Come on, this is nothing like that.
30317	Elliot	What the hell are you doing? Oh, hey, Elliot.
30318	J.D.	Actually, keith, it's a little like that.
30319	Elliot	Little bit.
30320	J.D.	One areola shot, real quick.
30321	J.D.'s narration	Now that Elliot was private practice, there were tons of perks. For one, Dr. Kelso still refused to speak to her.
30322	Elliot	Hey, Dr. Kelso. Oh, if you're a doody face, don't say anything.
30323	J.D.'s narration	Still, the biggest perk is that at 5:00, she gets to dump her patients on someone else and go home.
30324	Elliot	Mr.
30325	Cox	You're giving orders to me? OMG, barboo, you make me want to LOL. I just discovered text messaging. I know i'm a little late to the game, but that doesn't mean that you're any less of a G.
30326	Elliot	Well, i'm just a little bit late for my brow wax and my facial, so I'm just gonna stick these orders to your lab coat so you don't forget them. Enjoy doing my bidding, while a team of burly old Russian women make me beautiful.
30327	Cox	Fine, I don't want to go home, anyway.
30328	J.D.	He said in a sarcastic tone we've all come to know as "Coxsian."
30329	Cox	I mean it. I don't want to go home.Honey, I brought you some dinner.
30330	Jordan	Come here, little goaty goaty!I wasn't finished!
30331	Cox	You're finished.
30332	Turk	Honey, post partum depression's really serious.
30333	Carla	True, but there are different levels. Yes, some women leave their babies in the woods, but some women just get the weepies.
30334	Turk	And it's just the weepies?
30335	Carla	Just the weepies baby.
30336	Kid	Hi! Since you're African-American, I was wondering if I can borrow some of your marvin gaye cds?
30337	Turk	Sure. Come on in, kid. Here you go.
30338	Kid	Thanks! Mazel tov on the baby.
30339	Carla	How did he know I had a baby? Oh, great! I milked through my last clean t-shirt!
30340	Turk	Baby, we should really get some help.
30341	Carla	No! I've been a nurse for 15 years! What are they gonna tell us that we don't already know? Now, now, who are we?
30342	Turk	We're the Turks.
30343	Carla	And can the turks can get through this?
30344	Turk	Woman, the turks can handle anything.
30345	J.D.'s narration	To me, the best thing about Elliot is all her extra cash.
30346	Elliot	Hey, roomie! I went shopping. Oh, this couch reminded me of my grandpa. He used to drive around in a car just like it. You know, until he was killed in that 7-car pile-up.
30347	J.D.	"7- car pile-up" would be a good name for a rock band.
30348	Elliot	Yeah, you actually told me that on the day that he died. Anywho, I was thinking maybe we should put in some new hardwood floors.
30349	J.D.	Why stop at hardwood?
30350	Elliot	Yay, the new floors are in!
30351	J.D.	Careful. Trampoline floors take some gettin' used to. But I love 'em.I like bouncing, but it is dangerous.
30352	Cox	I don't care if you don't like green. Jello is jello. Laverne, if I accidentally backed my car over Barbie, for sticking me with the world most annoying patient, what do you think your boy jesus would do?
30353	Laverne	Your wife is on the phone.
30354	Cox	He is not a merciful god, is he? Just tell her I'm still working, I have no idea what time I'm going to get off, And just go ahead and eat the entire mattress. I mean, for the love of God! I spend the entire day with patients and the entire night with her. I need a hide-out.
30355	Janitor	You're telling me.
30356	Laverne	Can you tell Dr.
30357	Cox	My god, this is beautiful.
30358	Kelso	Gentlemen, how is Mr. Worthington doing?
30359	Cox	He, uh, he's in a coma, bob.
30360	Kelso	Great! the man has the health insurance of a Tahitian prince.
30361	Cox	Well, I gotta tell you, this is heaven.
30362	Janitor	This gourmet trail mix is fantastic. I'm tastin' vanilla, cranberry, a hint of pine.
30363	Cox	That's potpourri, genius.
30364	Janitor	Is that hickory?
30365	J.D.	You should see all the sweet new toys elliot bought.So, how are things at the homestead?
30366	Turk	Ah, no worries.
30367	Carla	I can't feed my own baby!
30368	Turk	See, baby, the great thing about working at a hospital is that we have access to all types of medical care. Having trouble feeding your baby? Bam, say hello to your lactation specialists.
30369	Todd	I can't see the nipple.
30370	Turk	Todd, get the hell out of here.
30371	Janitor	It's freezing in here.
30372	Cox	Put on a pair of pants, you'd be fine.
30373	Janitor	Hey, in my house, it's no pants, no problem. I'm putting in a videotape.
30374	Cox	Now, what the hell is this?
30375	Janitor	It's a security camera tape. I like to count the times that Colonel Doctor goes to the bathroom during the day, then freak him out by guessing the exact number. And there's one - Hey!
30376	Cox	Look, this this clearly isn't working out.
30377	Janitor	Well, I found this room, so you should go.
30378	Elliot	I specifically told you not to give Mr.
30379	Cox	Well, there were 2 treatment options, and when in doubt, I always go in the opposite direction of you.
30380	Elliot	Don't do it again.
30381	Cox	So, do it again? Look, barbie, What you're missing here is that you're private practice now. That means you're the enemy. And I know, as a doctor, disease is supposed to be the enemy, but I'm giving hepatitis and his bantam infectious buddies a pass, and I'm coming after you today. The bottom line is you'd rather clock out of here early than run the extra mile for your patients, and, barbie, that makes you a sell-out.
30382	Janitor	Ah, you went 14 times total 4 false alarms and one emergency.I'm exhausted. Pick me up a latte.
30383	Turk	We're the turks, remember? Now, if you ask me, Isabella is placing calls, but no one's responding in the areola code.
30384	Carla	What?
30385	Turk	Those 2 little turkey timers you got there are telling me that that birdie's not done.
30386	Carla	What?!
30387	Turk	Ding, ding! Turkey's done.
30388	Carla	She's latching.
30389	Elliot	Dr.

30392	Elliot	I mean, seriously, since when does working at a hospital suddenly make you a better person? It's such a load of crap.
30393	J.D.	I don't know if it's really a load of crap. it's just that, well, if you
30394	Elliot	I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
30395	J.D.	I just thought, you know, money, like a sell-out, so
30396	Elliot	Wait, do you actually agree with dr.
30397	J.D.	I guess I do.or even just a little surprise waiting at home.
30398	Turk	We're the turks, what?! we're the turks! we're the turks, what Why are you watching my baby, and where's my wife?
30399	Kid	She said she'd be back later.
30400	Turk	J.D., have you seen carla?
30401	J.D.	Sorry, brown bear. Hey, mocha cup.
30402	Laverne	Carla just called to tell you nothing fit, so she went to the mall.
30403	Elliot	ooh, hey, chuckles! If you're a doody face, just keep walking.I'm not mad.
30404	J.D.	I am not jealous.
30405	Elliot	Oh, please, J.
30406	J.D.	I do not! OK, resist smelling that coconut goodness that caresses your tresses! Don't do it! Whatever.
30407	Carla	I think these would go great with that shirt.
30408	Turk	Why were you just helping that guy? These pants and the shirt are the only things I have left that fit me, and everyone keeps mistaking me for an employee. Anyway, I was helping Phil with his whole new denim look.
30409	Phil	Hey, could you also get me
30410	Turk	Go away, Phil. Baby, let's go see the doctor.
30411	Carla	No, I'm not gonna have people laugh at me because I can't care for my own child.
30412	Keith	Put that down. Elliot said that until you admit you're jealous, You can't use any of her things.
30413	J.D.	Well, Elliot's not here, keith.
30414	Keith	Do not turn on that tv.
30415	Elliot	He wrestled you, didn't he? See, Keith got his old high school uniform so that he actually incorporated it into our love play. I'm the lesbian coach and he's the captain of the wrestling team, and he turns me. So, have you decided to admit that you're jealous?
30416	J.D.	No, never, ok? And thanks a lot, because the one hour that Kim and I had to actually talk, I was stuckin your stupid boyfriend's scissor-hold.
30417	Elliot	Oh, don't you just love the way his thighs feel against your ears?
30418	J.D.	No, not particularly.
30419	Turk	Dr. Cox, I need your help. Not now, Gandhi. Darn it all, I I could have sworn there was a room right here Do you hear something?Look, Carla's going all postpartum depression-y on me, And she won't let me to take her to see a doctor.
30420	Cox	She's never gonna listen to you. You're a guy. You have no idea what she's going through. The fact is, the only person she will listen to is someone who's gone through it themselves.
30421	Turk	Fine. Who?
30422	Cox	I cannot believe I am doing this.
30423	Turk	I'm scared.
30424	Cox	Me, too, Gandhi.
30425	Jordan	What!?
30426	Cox	You look pretty, dear.
30427	Turk	So pretty. Keikers? Nuts.
30428	Elliot	Hi, J. D. Relax, I'm at the hospital.
30429	J.D.	What's the matter? Your aryan boyfriend had to go to a rally, so now you have to watch me?
30430	Elliot	Look, you don't have to admit that you're jealous. I was thinking, Kim's not around, and I can't even imagine how much that sucks, so, I sent her a webcam just like this one, and you guys can video chat whenever you want. Anything to make the long distance easier, right? Anyway, I hope you like it. See you.
30431	Kelso	I love the interhighway.
30432	Janitor	I've been expecting you.
30433	Cox	You know, jumpsuit, As I was scaling the hospital, I had an epiphany. This back-and-forth between you and I is just gonna get worse and worse. I mean, the only thing I could think about was retaliation, And I'm relatively certain that you've got a couple of tricks up your sleeve, too.
30434	Janitor	I do have a friend. He works on wall street. He and I got a good look at your personal finances, and he agreed to fly into town and bash your head in.
30435	Cox	Right. That would roughly be what I'm referring to.
30436	Janitor	Ahh.We each ingest a cyanide capsule. On 3 One, 2, 3.
30437	Cox	No.
30438	Janitor	Sure?
30439	Cox	Get out of here. Look, there really is only one way to end this so that we both come out alive. We've got to page him.
30440	Kelso	You. Get the hell out of here before I charge you for every cashew you've pilfred from the mini-bar.
30441	Jordan	So you have post-partum depression.
30442	Carla	No.
30443	Turk	No, baby,you've got post - You have no lines in this play.
30444	Carla	Jordan, I can handle it.A job application for the gap.
30445	Jordan	Oh, that's a good career move.
30446	Carla	Look All I ever wanted was to be a mother, And now that I am one, I feel like I'm not cut out for it.
30447	Jordan	And you're ashamed of that? Well, wouldn't you be?Yeah.
30448	Carla	I don't know.
30449	Jordan	When jack wouldn't stop crying, I wanted to throw that bastard out the window.
30450	Carla	Really? I wanted to throw Isabella out the window. Yeah, but we just had our apartment repainted, and all the windows were sealed shut, so I just wanted to drop her off the roof.
30451	Turk	Oh, my god!
30452	Jordan	Listen, you can't get rid this by sheer force of will or positive thinking or taking advice from a big Hollywood movie star and the dead science fiction writer he worships. You need to get some help.
30453	Carla	OK.
30454	Turk	That's what I've been try
30455	Jordan	If you talk again, I'm going to eat you.

30461	Tux	All right, Izzie. This is what your mom looks like on anti-depressants.
30462	Carla	Oh, we're sharing secrets now?

30472	JD's Narration	After 6 weeks home with her baby, Carla was facing the decision that all new moms have to face. Whether she should go back to work.
30473	Carla	Ok, so. If we take my salary and subtract the cost of a full-time nanny plus her health insurance, we will still end up with... losing $5 a month?!?!
30474	Turk	This is completely your decision. I'm ok one way or the other.
30475	Carla	Maybe I'll try staying home with Izzy for a year.
30476	Turk	Yes!!!!
30477	JD's Narration	As for me, ever since my pregnant girlfriend left, I've been a little clingy with my roommate.
30478	Elliot	JD, I'm going to get a drink from the water fountain. Do you wanna come?
30479	JD	Please, Elliot. I'm not that desperate.
30480	JD's Narration	Although I am a little parched. Plus I could hold back her hair.
30481	JD	The mind is a freaky thing, Elliot.
30482	Elliot	I haven't sung since the 6th grade talent show when I did Pat Benatar's "Hell Is For Children".
30483	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
30484	J.D.'s narration	Everyone had gathered, because today was Carla's first day back since she had the baby.
30485	Elliot	She's coming! This is not a drill, repeat.
30486	Turk	Remember, one group says "Welcome", one group says "back", one group says "Carla".
30487	Elliot	Fine, it was a drill.
30488	Carla	Hey everyone! Okay, let's have it.
30489	Turk	Dammit, people! - It's ok, baby.
30490	Carla	Hey, everyone.
30491	J.D.	I did.
30492	Turk	Done.
30493	Carla	Actually babe, I'm just heading back home.
30494	Turk	Ooh, pickle, I'm sorry.
30495	Kelso	What is all this fuss about nurse Turkleton returning? She's only been gone six days.
30496	Cox	She's been gone 6 weeks, Bobo. But wait, before I make you look like a complete idiot, we'd all like to thank you for setting up the new employee discount of copydump. Gang! - Cheers! - Pickle!
30497	Kelso	Stop, if it had taken any effort I wouldn't have done it.
30498	Cox	And back to insulting you, she's been gone 6 weeks, Bobo, the 6 days that you're referring to are the 6 days you actually worked this month.
30499	J.D.'s narration	Dr.

30505	Kelso	Listen up, faces.
30506	Debbie	Debbie is actually my name.
30507	Kelso	Then our reference is to the others, you will be Slagathor.
30508	J.D.'s narration	I always wondered what he did in his office all day.
30509	Kelso	Human Magic 8 Ball, tell me if I should play golf this weekend.
30510	Ted	I'm a lawyer!
30511	Kelso	I said, should I play golf?
30512	Ted	Ask again later. Why would I say that?
30513	J.D.'s narration	My daydreams are crazy.
30514	Ted	Ooohdizzy.
30515	J.D.'s narration	Since Elliot bought a house, I had to look for a place to live. Time to get out of my head and into an apartment.
30516	J.D.	Hey, Dr.

30526	Elliot	Oh, please Laverne.
30527	Carla	So you think it's OK to just kill animals for sport?
30528	Janitor	If it serves or use for purpose, yes I do.
30529	Kelso	Well, I'll check on you later, son.
30530	Cox	Poor kid, said he's blown off, all for nothing.
30531	Laverne	All for nothing? My nephew Lance is over there fighting to give those people democracy.
30532	Cox	Ooh, so that's why we're over there.
30533	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
30534	Todd	Dude, I hear they have laws that make women completely cover their bodies, when around in public.
30535	Turk	Elliot, if you - Kill you!

30537	Elliot	J.
30538	J.D.	Can you excuse me a second?! Did you bring her back in stubbing a newspapers?
30539	Turk	Carla is making me normally up when I go near things after the funnies.
30540	Elliot	Well, JD, the war? - I don't have time for this, Elliot.
30541	Janitor	Typical Dorian.Really? Point to Iraq.
30542	J.D.	Why do you keep a globe on your janitor cart? Guess i get lost.That's Iraq.
30543	Janitor	Some outrageous accusation.

30545	Kelso	Well, send it to her anyway. She should know what she's missing.I like this kid.Fantastic! And Johhny got a tattoo on the same cheek that says "Bobby".No, you just can't find that kind of bond in civilian life. Although I've often wondered what my life would be like if I'd stayed in the Service.I would have asked to be stationed in South East Asia for the food.
30546	Laverne	You goin' crap wise all you lots.
30547	Cox	And when you say Lord you mean Halliburton, right?
30548	Elliot	Ok, who here thinks democracy is worth fighting for? - Me! - I do! - Yeah! - Oh yeah! Who here thinks we were manipulated by false claims of WMDs ? We're here! - We do! - Me!Neat.
30549	Laverne	Ted, what do you think? - I think both sides have valid points.
30550	Cox	Why d'you take a stand, Swept Balls?Oh, you liberals survey and every american agrees with you, that's why Jonh Kerry and Al Gore both won in landslides.
30551	Turk	Oh, my God.
30552	Elliot	You know what? I don't need to be ashamed of this, anymore. Yes, I'm a Republican.
30553	Keith	Elliot! Me too.I hate that bitch.

30555	Laverne	He's stable.
30556	Kelso	Whose fault is this? * Turk, Elliot and Cox exculpating *They need a leader Bob, give them one.I SAID THAT'S ENOUGH!
30557	Cox	Just a second on the yelling there Bob. Do you think you can actually be an absentee chief of medicine and still matter? Let me see if I can make this real clear for you. If this hospital were a human body, you'd be the appendix because at one time you served some function, but it was so long ago, nobody is quite sure what that was anymore. Excuse us, we're gonna talk it out over here.
30558	Kelso	Well, you've got what you asked for, Bob. They don't need you. Hey, son.
30559	Brian	Well, even though no one ever comes every time I hit this nurse's button, I feel a little better.
30560	Kelso	That's morphine.
30561	Brian	That explains it.
30562	Kelso	That's how you get people around you to listen to you, Bob.
30563	J.D.	Hey, buddy, You've found an apartment yet? No, man, i feel like an idiot so I've been reading up on this whole Iraq war situation.
30564	Kelso	All right, listen up people.

30567	Elliot	And I can help out Dr.
30568	Janitor	You know if you're really serious about helping out I can use a hand of my to-do list I need to clean the toilets? I'm just tired of staring at that.
30569	Kelso	So, nobody needs any help.
30570	Laverne	When is your wife coming back to work? I'm drowning here without the Head Nurse.
30571	Kelso	Ok, ladies, I posted your room assignments on the board and we'll pass out the new weekly schedules before your shifts are over.
30572	Laverne	What did you think it would be like?
30573	Cox	We're losing him.Way to go Bob, way to go! That a boy!
30574	Kelso	I'm sorry what was the question? Jumbo Latte for Dr.
30575	Cox	Would you like to see something else that's really neat? Check out to this quote written on your cup.
30576	Elliot	"I enjoy laughing at poor people" Elliot Reid - April 2006 When I said that, I was watching "Good Time"!
30577	Cox	That's gonna be on every Jumbo Cup for a month, courtesy of my anti-war peeps. Can I get a hell HEAH? HELL YEAH!! OH YEAH!!
30578	Elliot	Typical lame liberal tactic, taking something out of context in order to defame someone's integrity. Am I right my pro-war amigos? - YEAH!! - OH YEAH!!
30579	Janitor	Gods, there seems to be a lot of high volume over enthusiastic opinion sharing, going on today.
30580	Turk	OkI'veI've seen enough.
30581	Elliot	Uhm, consider that a little gift from Nurse Roberts' nephew, Corporal Roberts.
30582	Kelso	Ok, Janice I'm going to need you to make sure Mr.
30583	Cox	Oh, Nurse Kelso, ooh, purple is not your color. Listen, could you con out the housekeeping and maybe send up some fresh scrubs for me and psst, come here. Please put on a bra, you're distracting some of the other doctors.
30584	Kelso	Let him joke, you look spippy and you're doing great.
30585	Laverne	Girl, just humor him.
30586	Kelso	Private, I'm gonna let you hand on a little secret.If only.
30587	Brian	"My bagingo's on fire" May 2004 What's a "Bagingo"?
30588	Kelso	Eventually, your page is gonna go unreturned your test isn't gonna get run as quickly as they should have been, and sounds like kids like yourself gonna pay the price. What bothers me about it, is that I know this is going on, but there's nothing I can do to change it.
30589	Brian	Why not?
30590	Kelso	Let's just say that 'round here I'm not as loved as your sergent was.
30591	Brian	We hated Sgt. Bourne.
30592	Kelso	Come again?
30593	Brian	Yeah, he demeaned us, overworked us. Still, maybe sometimes that's what being a good leader is uniting everybody by giving them someone to hate.
30594	Kelso	All right, listen up gang.
30595	Cox	You mind telling us why?
30596	Kelso	Why the hell not? That ought to do it.
30597	J.D.	Since I've spent this afternoon researching the war in Iraq, I couldn't wait to dive right into the spirit of debate.
30598	Cox	What a jackass! Come on, no one wants to debate Iraq with me?
30599	Janitor	I'll debate Iraq with you.
30600	J.D.	Prepare to be dazzled.
30601	Janitor	Ok, in my opinion we should be looking for Bin Laden in Pakistan.
30602	J.D.	You've that globe nearby?
30603	J.D.'s narration	In life it seems we all have a role to play. Some of us are meant to be loved, and some of us, unfortunately, are meant to be hated.
30604	Kelso	Good night minions, Slugathor.
30605	J.D.'s narration	For Dr. Kelso, he wouldn't have it any other way.

30618	Ted	So it's uhh, wheelchair accessable for her, sir?
30619	Kelso	Ted, I'm not retiring for at least three years. If she's still alive I'll deal with it then. Now, take the rest of the day off and get it washed and waxed.
30620	Ted	You smell like my mom...
30621	J.D.	Alright, Mr. Mariani, mazel tov; you are the proud owner of yet another kidney stone! Did you try laying off the red meat, buddy?
30622	Mr. Mariani	I'm trying, Doc, but it's hard.
30623	J.D.	Oh man, Kim is having her first ultrasound tommorow.
30624	Turk	Oh, there's nothing like that first ultrasound. Bring tissue.
30625	J.D.	Are you kidding me? I can't just up and leave, I got to find an apartment I live in a T.P.
30626	Dr Cox	Do-o-o-rian! you have been wrong about so many things, that, I'm not even gonna say something is wrong, anymore, instead I'm going to say - It's a 'Dorian' . And the fact that you are willing to skip seeing that child's heart-beat for the first time is just plain' 'Dorian'. I mean - Hell! Jordan is having her second ultrasound and I couldn't be more gay. I can't wait to find out the sex of that unborn tax break.
30627	Turk	Jordan doesn't let you know the sex until the baby is born.
30628	Dr. Cox	'Dorian' again! Ye I don't know if it's the hormones or if the baby is actually eating the bitch cells, but Jordan has softened; in fact last night she... she asked me to cuddle.
30629	J.D. Narration	Is cuddling bad now?
30630	Turk	Baby? I need permission to road trip with J.D. to Tacoma so he can see his ultrasound.
30631	Carla	Sure! I think not giving you permission to do this for your friend would be totally 'Dorian'.
30632	J.D's Narration	How has this spreading so quickly?
30633	Dr Cox	Ghandi! Did you tell Jordan what I've said about her wanting to cuddle? She doesn't like people to know that she actually cares for me.
30634	Turk	Relax, she's pregnant. What can she possibly do?
30635	Jack	Man check!
30636	Turk	Oh!
30637	Jordan	Good boy, Jack, good boy!
30638	Turk	He can't possibly make it my fault, right?
30639	J.D.	'Dorian'. Oh, damn it now I'm doing it. Careful, he's going fetus.
30640	J.D. Narration	The secret to a great road trip is to get as many people as possible to come along.
30641	J.D.	So you guys in?
30642	Elliot	Totally! The last road trip I went on was with my sorority sisters and we went to Tijuana, so it'll be nice to go with people who actually like me.
30643	Keith	Why are you always so hard on yourself? Your sorority sisters probably loved you.
30644	Elliot	Keith, they tried to sell me.
30645	J.D.	You know, Keith, if the buyer hadn't been an undercover federal, Elliot would be a slave somewhere. There wouldn't be any uncomftorable sexual tension between us, and you and I would probably be best friends.
30646	Keith	Ye?
30647	J.D.	Ye...
30648	Elliot	Keith!
30649	Keith	Oh, uhh... We still can't make it, we made plans to finally hang out with my grandmom.
30650	Elliot	Oh Keith, the woman is 96 years old there will be plenty of weekends for that; Road trip!
30651	J.D.	This way.
30652	Elliot	O.K.
30653	Dr Cox	You know, you are one special lady, Carla. It's not every wife that works a full shift then goes home to change the baby's diapers while her husband and his girlfriend spend the weekend mooning truckers and playing slud bug.
30654	Carla	It's not a big deal.
30655	Dr Cox	Oh, but it is. If you keep let Ghandi do whatever he pleases whenever he pleases while you take care of the baby, eventually you won't even have time to shave your legs or gum your face, thats make the most promotive male figure in your daughter's life... you.
30656	Turk	Adios, pickle! As soon as I change out of this clothes - I'm outta here.
30657	Carla	I'm going, you're staying.
30658	Turk	How did you do that?
30659	Dr Cox	Ghandi, I'm great at this stuff. Don't ever talk to Jordan again.
30660	J.D.	Road trip! Where's chocolate bear?
30661	Carla	Getting to know his daughter.
30662	J.D. Narration	I knew that little tant baby will eventually ruin everything.
30663	Elliot	Keith, take the front sit, sweetie.
30664	Keith	Uhh, I can't.
30665	J.D.	Rowdy needs to see the world.
30666	Carla	We need a bigger ride.
30667	Ted	Do you guys know where I can find a giant car wash?
30668	J.D.	Oh! Alright!
30669	Ted	Woohoo! I got friends!
30670	Jordan	Hi cutie!
30671	Turk	Hi...
30672	Jordan	Oh like there's a chance I meant you.
30673	Turk	So you're here for the ultrasound, huh? I can't believe you gonna let him know the sex, especially when you could No, thats too mean, I couldn't do it.
30674	Jordan	No, mean is good. It's uhh, It's, uhh..... I like mean.
30675	Turk	You can learn the sex, not tell Perry, hold it over his head and play him like a little bitch boy.
30676	Jordan	Perry was so wrong about you! You're not an idiotic scalpel holding, basketball dribbling, blood sugar watching idiotic man boy.
30677	Turk	Stop...
30678	Keith	This thing is awesome!
30679	Elliot	What's with all these Kimonos?
30680	Carla	I don't know but there is a stripper pole in the back!
30681	J.D.	Carla got some serious moves! She can even do an inverted spread - legs pole spin. You know if thats how they called, It's not like I've take a pole dancing class or anything.
30682	J.D. Narration	Nice cover.
30683	Ted	Don't touch the kimonos, those are for Dr Kelso's various masseuses.
30684	J.D.	Ted, who's driving?
30685	Ted	Oh, my bad!
30686	Elliot	Maybe I should drive so we all won't die. No offense, Ted.
30687	Ted	None taken.
30688	Keith	I wish non of us had to drive...
30689	Computer	We are cruising at a comfortable speed, Dr. Dorian. We should arrive on schedule. Could you possible do me a small favor?
30690	J.D.	Of course, Jonathan 3000.
30691	Computer	Could you rub that spot off my dashboard?
30692	J.D.	You got it, pal.
30693	Computer	Oh yeah, just like that.
30694	J.D.	Alright.
30695	Computer	That's the stuff, you bitch!
30696	J.D.	It can get lonely on the road, even for computers. But this is gonna be great, right?
30697	Carla	I miss my baby. We have to go back.
30698	Doctor	Now, if we'll slide the wan over here, we'll see if it's a boy or a girl.
30699	Jordan	Wait! Change of plans, Per. Beat it.
30700	Dr Cox	No, no, no ; You committed to find out the sex of the child this time.
30701	Jordan	Oh yeah, I am gonna find out the sex, but you're not. Unless you'll work with Jack for the parent-child dance recital.
30702	Dr Cox	Jordan, the boy alredy lip sings into your tampons, must we put the final nail on his tiny gay coffin?
30703	Jordan	Momma wants a trophy.
30704	Dr Cox	Tell her she can't do this.
30705	Doctor	I would, but when she looks at me my inside gets all cold.
30706	Dr Cox	You're a coward! You're a coward!
30707	Turk	O-oh... Did Jordan change her mind for some strange unexpected reason?
30708	Dr Cox	Here, here, here, I'll help you.
30709	Turk	Thanks, that could be awesome.
30710	Dr Cox	Yo Beardface! Take your foot go ninety-ish. That a boy. Yeah!
30711	Turk	That was awesome. But uncool!
30712	Carla	He's not answering... Something is wrong with the baby I'm telling Elliot to turn around.
30713	J.D.	No, no, no, no, no. Carla darling, everything is fine with the baby, fine with the Hi what's that? Now I'll let you out when you calm down!
30714	Carla	Open this door J.D., let me out!
30715	Elliot	Now I realized that my dad had hugged me in my graduation. Not with his arms, you know, but, with his brain. Keith! Come and get me company, I'm lonely.
30716	Keith	Ye you know who else is lonely? My grandmom.
30717	Elliot	No, she's not, Keith. She is a lesbian in a nursing home full of ladies, you do the math.
30718	Keith	We can solve both of our problems if we can get my grandmother together with your mom.
30719	Ted	Excuse me, my mother sleeps with men, I've seen it!
30720	Keith	Alright, calm down, momma's boy.
30721	Ted	Bring it on, tall and sexy!
30722	Elliot	Kick his ass, Ted!
30723	J.D.	That's enough! If you guys can't get along just sit down and don't talk.
30724	Janitor	Amen to that.
30725	J.D.	Whar are you doing here?
30726	Janitor	I'll tell you what I wasn't doing here I was not taking a nap on company time on Dr Kelso's mobile home. Not this guy! Back to work.
30727	Ted	I don't think he knew we were moving...
30728	J.D.	Elliot, Stop!
30729	Jordan	So, can I stop squizzing out brats or is is another stupid boy?
30730	Doctor	Uh oh... Excuse me for a second.
30731	Jordan	Uh oh? Don't say Uh oh!
30732	Turk	I'm supposed to be in a road trip right now.
30733	Dr Cox	Well there's a little different between a road trip and an ultrasound!
30734	Turk	I'm supposed to be in a road trip right now!
30735	Jordan	Follow him! He said Uh oh.
30736	Elliot	O.K , let's get you up.
30737	Janitor	Where did everyone go?
30738	J.D.	He's fine, let's get going.
30739	Carla	Look at us. I hurt my ankle, Ted might have a broken arm and the Janitor is blind.
30740	Janitor	Hi, wait, no. coming back. Hello. Who is making pancakes?
30741	J.D.	See? He's great. And so is Ted.
30742	Ted	Ahhh! Oh... I think you popped it back in the joint.
30743	J.D.	You guys, Turk told me how amazing it was when he say Izzy's ultrasound, I can't miss this, I just, I won't.
30744	Janitor	Can I say something? I don't know this young man, I wish I did. I admire his spirit! And if he says we must continue on then I say I am in!
30745	J.D. Narration	There are a lot of times in life when you just got to take control.
30746	J.D.	Wait, give me those keys. I'm driving. Next stop Kim town.
30747	J.D Narration	Of course, sometimes, control is taking away from you.
30748	Dr Cox	You have to operate on my baby while it's still in the womb?
30749	Dr Matthews	Well there's a urinary tract obstruction that could be blocking the amniotic fluid. We need to cause a shunt.
30750	Dr Cox	I got to talk to Jordan.
30751	Turk	Mickhead! Give me my phone.
30752	Mickhead	It's mine.
30753	Turk	Oh really? Does yours have a picture of Carla in the background?
30754	Mickhead	Yes.
30755	Turk	Huh! Trick question mine got Tyra Banks, see?
30756	Carla	Baby? I got Turk!
30757	J.D Narration	And sometimes you're just not as in control as you think you are.
30758	Ted	Uhh, that tunnel looks kinda small.
30759	J.D.	Chill out, Ted.
30760	J.D. Narration	why would they build a tunnel that an R.V. won't fit ? I can admit that the tunnel was more narrow than I thought but the damage wasn't too bad. Keith just had to stop accidentily making the 'please honk your horn' sign to to passing truckers.
30761	Elliot	Frick on a stick!
30762	Keith	I was stretching!
30763	Ted	Four aces, I win!
30764	Janitor	Now you only got six clover, I win.
30765	Carla	O.K. baby, bye. There's a problem with Jordan's ultrasound.
30766	Dr Matthews	This is our best chance to restore normal function and minimize the damage to the lungs.
30767	Dr Cox	Fine but I want to be in there.
30768	Dr Matthews	You know we can't allow family members in the O.R.
30769	Dr Cox	You gotta be in there for me.
30770	Turk	Don't you see I got a baby strapped to my chest?
30771	Dr Cox	Now can you?
30772	Turk	First of all, I'm not a newborns surgeon. Second, you ruined my road trip. And you just gave my baby to Rochelle, the only nurse to get kicked out of the nursery for using babies as a ventriloquist dummy.
30773	Rochelle	I don't like being licked.Thats because you didn't find anyone who doing it right.
30774	Turk	Give me that. What's the matter with you?!
30775	Dr Cox	Ghandi! You'd damn sure want somebody in there if it was your kid.
30776	Rochelle	C'mon, just do it.
30777	Turk	Knock it off, Rochelle.
30778	J.D.	You guys, here's the hospital.
30779	Elliot	Keith, wake up sweety we're here.
30780	Keith	Yes! I didn't see a truck.
30781	Elliot	Well, how are you gonna get home?
30782	J.D.	I don't know, I'll rent a car or something. Go take care of Dr. Cox; tell him Gladys is thinking of him, he'll know it's me.
30783	Elliot	Good luck.
30784	Janitor	Very well, stranger. I shall toast you with my hardest wine.
30785	J.D.	Maybe he should lay down.
30786	Dr Kelso	Turkelton, if I let you assist on that on that surgery I would be breaking every hospital protocol, and you know damn well I would never be that inappropriate. Oh thanks, sugar boobs. Lucky for you, I am a man in need. Enid asked me to get her tickets to see Al Green for her birthday, I forgot. Now it sold out. Can you call him for me?
30787	Turk	Sir, do you think I know Al Green just because I'm black?
30788	Dr Kelso	Plan B. Also, lucky for you - Enid has gone blind from glaucoma, now - here's what I need.
30789	J.D. Narration	In life, it's never easy to know what's waiting for you on the other side of the door.
30790	J.D.	Surprise.
30791	Kim	Oh my God... J.D.!
30792	J.D.	Come here for a second, come here. Is this your office?
30793	Dr Cox	Everything is gonna be O.K.
30794	Jordan	I know.
30795	Dr Cox	Jordan, I love you.
30796	J.D. Narration	Sometimes you find a moment that knocks you on your ass.
30797	J.D.	How's our baby doing, huh?
30798	Kim	J.D., I had a miscarrige.
30799	J.D.	Other times, it just takes your breath away.
30800	Turk	Wow...Hi. So everything went great, ye. Jordan and the baby are fine.
30801	Dr Cox	Fair enough.
30802	Turk	That's it?
30803	Dr Cox	Yep.
30804	Turk	O.K. I don't know about you, but when I get great news I like to show some form of emotion. Like when I graduated med school I went all Billy 'white shoes' Johnson. And then when Izzy was born, Tiger Woods' arm swing.
30805	Dr Cox	Look, you know as well as I do that no kid who had surgery before it's even born not just gonna pop up in the world without any... without any problems. In three months, it's gonna outgrow that shunt and we're gonna have to get through it all over again so you're gonna have to excuse me if I'm... not celebrating.
30806	Turk	Your baby is gonna be fine.
30807	Dr Cox	And just how can you be so sure at that?
30808	Turk	Because that little thing grabbed my finger so tight, and wouldn't let go. Perry, she's strong.
30809	Perry	She?
30810	Turk	Yes, daddy.
30811	Kim	I should have told you earlier, I just didn't want to do it on the phone and... are you O.K.?
30812	J.D.	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I just... it's kinda weird, there was this thing that I never met and now it's gone and I kinda miss it.
30813	Kim	I know...
30814	J.D.	I was alredy kinda looking for doing all those parents things you hear about, you know like - change diapers, first steps, playing catch. Turk was gonna even teach me how to throw like a guy, so...
30815	Kim	Unless it was a girl, then you could just throw like yourself. Can I ask you something? Were we just staying together cuz' we were having a kid?
30816	J.D.	No... no, c'mon. Come back from this in a couple of months and we'll pick up whereever we left off. I mean, I guess it will be a little more casual, we should probably won't talk without either one of us wearing full body condoms.
30817	Kim	What if I... wasn't coming back because they offered me a permanent position here?
30818	J.D.	Did they?
30819	Kim	Yeah...
30820	J.D. Narration	We sat there all night and talked about everything. How we felt about each other, whether we can handle a long distance relationship, did she ever see herself come back to 'The Sacred Heart', will a pizza place deliver to a bench at three in the morning... they would... And on the end of it all, we realized that without a baby in the picture, the best thing to do is to say goodbye, stay friends and just hope that our paths cross again. Someday.
30821	J.D.	So then I took a $900 cab ride home, and voilà: here I am.
30822	Elliot	J.D., thats sucks. I'm so sorry.
30823	Mr. Mariani	Bummer. Now why am I back in here again?
30824	J.D.	Cos' I couldn't wait to rub a little jelly on your treasure trail. I need to see if your kidney stone dissolved yet. J... D... I always do that.
30825	Elliot	Do mine.
30826	J.D Narration	There are really only two kinds of surprises. The good ones, that makes everything O.K.
30827	Dr Cox	It's a girl... we're having a baby girl.
30828	J.D. Narration	And the bad ones, that makes you mad.
30829	Kelso	There's papa's pleasure palace. It looks great, Teddy.
30830	Ted	I'm going on vacation.
30831	Kelso	Theodore!
30832	J.D.	Alright, let's take a look.
30833	J.D. Narration	And I could never be mad at Kim for giving me a bad surprise.
30834	Doctor	Everything looks healthy. See? Here's your baby's heart beat.
30835	Kim	Wow...
30836	J.D. Narration	Because at least she was straight with me.
30837	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
30838	Man	Hey, grandpa, a little help.
30839	Dr. Kelso	Here you go, sport. But call me "grandpa" again, and you and I are gonna play a little game called "hide the wingtip". There may be a generational gap here, I'll explain. The wingtip is my shoe, the hiding place is your ass.
30840	Maggie	Hi, Bob. That's why I always save you a place. You keep the riff raff in check.
30841	Dr. Kelso	My pleasure. Well, let's see what Enid packed for lunch today. A stapler and a golf ball. She's not well.
30842	Maggie	Trade ya. My apple for your golf ball.
30843	Dr. Kelso	Done. Maggie, how long has your foot been like that?Nurse Turkelton, I want you to take good care of my friend Maggie here. Don't worry, we'll take care of you.
30844	Carla	Name and insurance, please.
30845	Maggie	Maggie Kent, and none.
30846	Carla	All right, let's find her a room.
30847	J.D.'s narration	When a patient doesn't have insurance, you have to work around the system. First, you have to find someone who's recently died.
30848	J.D.	Cool, Mr. Rabinowitz just kicked it! Oh, don't worry, he put his peep in an electrical socket. You can't do that.
30849	J.D.'s narration	Then you have to convince the morgue guy to sit on the paperwork so the deceased's bed stays open.
30850	Doug	Deal.
30851	J.D.'s narration	Then you have to get the floor nurses to play along.
30852	Laverne	Enjoy your kosher meal, Mr. Rabinowitz.
30853	J.D.'s narration	Then you have to find a surgeon to do the work pro bono.
30854	The Todd	Dude, I've had a pro bono, like, all morning. Something-might-be-wrong five!
30855	Turk	I got this one.
30856	J.D.'s narration	But, most importantly, you can't let any higher-ups find out that a patient is uninsured, even if they're the ones who brought her here in the first place.
30857	Maggie	Bob, I want to thank you for doing all this, even though I don't have any...
30858	J.D.	Dr. Kelso, we need to talk to you.
30859	Dr. Kelso	What is it?
30860	J.D.	Uh, we want to go somewhere with you.
30861	Dr. Kelso	Okay. Where?
30862	J.D.	A spa. We'd like to get some massages.
30863	Dr. Kelso	Well, I know just the place.
30864	Turk	Great, now I've got a crick in my neck.
30865	Dr. Kelso	We're gonna get a little graphic here, so you fellas might want to look the other way, or not, it's your choice.
30866	J.D.	Turk, why are you looking?
30867	Turk	It's my neck crick. I can't move.
30868	Dr. Kelso	Watch this, Turkelton. She calls it the "Shanghai Surprise".
30869	Turk	Oh, God.
30870	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
30871	Turk	Okay, Maggie, as soon as your labs come back, we'll prep you for surgery.
30872	Maggie	You two are my guardian angels.
30873	Dr. Kelso	Hey, good morning, fellas.
30874	J.D.	Sir, how are you? Lookin' good.
30875	Turk	What's happening with you?
30876	Dr. Kelso	Why so awkward? You never saw a colleague get a happy ending before?
30877	Turk	No, not that happy.
30878	J.D.	But thank you for including us.
30879	Dr. Cox	Oh, say, Barbie, wait just a second. I gotta tell you, you look... Well, darn it all, you look great today.
30880	Elliot	Thanks!
30881	Dr. Cox	Yeah.
30882	Elliot	I started using that new facial cream made from baby foreskins.
30883	Dr. Cox	Oh!
30884	Elliot	But I don't understand... You haven't complimented me in six years. Why today?
30885	Dr. Cox	Well, since you're a private practice doctor who went home yesterday at 5:00, leaving me up all night with your melanoma patient, I just knew if I complimented you, sure as shootin' you'd look at me just a hair too long, and then this would happen.
30886	Elliot	Oh, you think you're funny?
30887	Dr. Cox	I do. I always have, ever since I was little. It's one of the reasons that I'm a winner.
30888	Elliot	I'm in a hurry. I promised one of my patients that I would meet him for his first day of drug counselling. See? I wrote it right there.
30889	Dr. Cox	Oh, Barboo, gimme a break. Why in God's name do you think I'd care about anything that you wrote down?
30890	Elliot	You wouldn't.Ha!
30891	Carla	Nice! Hey, can you believe who the new drug counseller is?
30892	Sam Thompson	I just want you all to know that I've been right where you are. Hell, a couple of years ago, I was in this very hospital, scamming that nice doctor over there for painkills. Can everyone say hi to Dr. Reid?
30893	Group	Hi, Dr. Reid.
30894	Elliot	Hey, drug addicts! What's up?
30895	Laverne	Girl, can you believe what they sell in these white people magazines? Look here. This is a computer chip that you can put in your baby's foot, so you can track it. Like a baby LoJack.
30896	Carla	Yeah, white people do that craziest things.
30897	Laverne	Like bumper stickers. I don't give a damn what you brake for.
30898	Janitor	I know. White people. No... No, my step-mom is one-quarter Inuit, so I'm part Eskimo. Anyway, small favor. I need your baby. I'm getting into the baby broker business. Nothing illicit, I'm just hooking up folks who can't have babies with folks that don't want babies.
30899	Carla	You, leave.You, give me that baby LoJack number.
30900	Laverne	Already tore it out.
30901	Turk	Hey.
30902	Carla	Babe, where were you? We were supposed to meet for breakfast.
30903	Turk	My bad, I was hanging out with J.D. and Rowdy, and we decided to pull a prank that we used to do back in the day.
30904	J.D.	Here comes Ted! Go, go, go, pull!
30905	Ted	I love you, I love you. Ghost dog!
30906	Dr. Kelso	Calm down, people. We have a back-up generator. Thank God. I was just bluffing.
30907	Turk	Won't be doing that again.
30908	Dr. Kelso	Ted, look at this budget! I've got half a notion to make you pay for every cent of that new transformer.
30909	Ted	I'm telling you, sir, a lifeless ghost dog glided in front of my car wearing roller skates.
30910	Dr. Kelso	If this is your way of trying to make me feel guilty about paving over that Indian burial ground, it isn't going to work. We needed the damn parking spaces! Now, why in the hell are we paying this much money for scrubs?
30911	Ted	Maybe people are stealing them.
30912	Dr. Kelso	Now, why would people be stealing scrubs?
30913	Ted	Hey, Mom. A guy tried to die on me today, but I didn't let him. I didn't let him.
30914	Choir	What a friend we have in Jesus.
30915	Doug	Excuse me, guys, stealing scrubs here.
30916	Sam	So, anyway, I've been an addict since I was 14. About a year ago, I realized it was time to wake up and get sober.
30917	Elliot	So, you finally just hit rock bottom.
30918	Sam	No, no, no. I hit a cop. But anyway, since I wasn't willing to do the things, you know, you need to do in jail to get narcotics, at least not enthusiastically, I... I got clean.
30919	Dr. Cox	I have a game. Raise your hand if you're full of crap. Sam, if you don't raise your hand, you're going to lose the game.
30920	Sam	Come on, man. You don't know how hard it's been to stay straight.
30921	The Todd	Been there, brother.
30922	Janitor	Arrrrrrr.
30923	Carla	Turk! You know I hate that damn dog!
30924	Janitor	No, it's not bald, black doctor. It's haired, half-white, half-Inuit Janitor, and this is the real Rowdy.
30925	Carla	Excuse me?
30926	Janitor	You recall a couple years ago, you lost him?Woof-woof.
30927	Janitor's voice-over	You were panicked that your husband was gonna find out, so I sold my entire stuffed squirrel army in exchange for Stephen, an exact replica.
30928	Janitor	What you don't know is that I retraced your steps that day, and I found Rowdy. Now, I think if your husband knew that he'd been loving a fake dead dog all this time, he'd be very unhappy.
30929	Carla	You're a crazy person.
30930	Janitor	Am I? Or am I a brilliant mastermind who's waited two long years until he needed something from you? And now that day has come. Here's what I want. I want your baby. We already talked about that. I want you to tell that new borderline anorexic nurse to eat a sandwich and then to go salsa dancing with me. Also, I want you to teach me to salsa dance. I want a pound of frankincense, mostly just to see what it is. And, lastly, I'm in a little bit of a tiff with the main barista down at Coffee Bucks. He's not above poisoning me, so I'm gonna need you to be my official beverage taster. Yes?
30931	Carla	I'm just gonna confess everything to Turk.
30932	Janitor	Grrrrrrrr.No, easy, boy, we'll get her.
30933	Elliot	Why can't you just give Sam a break?
30934	Dr. Cox	Look, the only thing Sam did was to go from being a lying drug addict, to being a lying drug addict who works here.
30935	Elliot	People change. I knew this one migrant worker from our orchard, Ramon. He used to say "I hate applesauce. It destroys the integrity of the la manzana." Manzana's Spanish for "apple". Anyway. Last time I was home, I asked how Ramon was doing. Vice President of Mott's Applesauce. It's true, Ramon Delgado, look him up on the Internet.
30936	Dr. Cox	I will.
30937	Elliot	Don't, I made it up. The point is, people can change and you know it.
30938	Dr. Cox	Nothing ever changes. The artist formerly known as Prince is still just Prince. My ex-wife is still pretty much my wife. Grey's Anatomy always wraps up every episode with some cheesy voiceover that ties together all of the storylines, which, incidentally, is my least favorite device on television. Newbie continually will try to violate my "no touching" policy. Uh-huh. And Republicans will forever try to raise...
30939	J.D.	Sneak hug!
30940	Dr. Cox	Of course, I would go kill him right now, but he actually just helped prove my point.
30941	Laverne	This is gonna help, too. There are 10 orders of Percocet missing from the pharmacy.
30942	Dr. Cox	Well, I think I have a pretty good idea who I'm gonna give my complimentary urine test to.
30943	Maggie	So, how bad is it going to be?
30944	Turk	Well, you're going to lose the dead tissue, but, thanks to modern medicine, you're gonna keep most of your foot. You wouldn't believe how much worse it would have been even a few years ago.This might hurteth a little.
30945	J.D.	Look, milady, I know it stinks that we're removing your foot and plan to eat it tonight at the Healing Feast, but you wouldn't believeth how much worse this would have been even a few years ago.
30946	Maggie	Unga unga bunga ungo.
30947	Turk	Unga.
30948	J.D.	Buga buga.
30949	Turk	Unga bunga.
30950	Maggie	Ooh? Hmm?
30951	Turk	Unga! Unga! Unga!
30952	J.D.'s narration	Unga bunga tonga runga, katonga patonga bonga.
30953	J.D.	I may have killed you, but I think I was upset about it.
30954	Dr. Kelso	Listen up, people! Gather round. Not you, Mr. Miler. Staff only. All right, this is going to be very simple. Whoever has been stealing scrubs is going to raise their hand, pay the hospital back and be immediately fired. Let's see 'em. Okay, you people leave me no choice.There, now you all have to wear scrubs so hideous that no one would steal them. You brought this on yourself, you thieving bastards.
30955	Carla	Turk, I need to talk to you about Rowdy...
30956	Turk	Okay, wait. Before you say anything, sorry I skipped out on breakfast to good around with Rowdy, but you gotta understand, Rowdy is more than just a dead toy to J.D. and me. We got him together in college and he's always been there.
30957	Carla	The key to the salsa is passion.
30958	Janitor	And spin!
30959	Laverne	There were no drugs in Sam's bag and his urinalysis came back clean.
30960	Sam	Don't beat yourself up, big guy. I would have suspected me, too.
30961	Elliot	Maybe we should post the transcript for your "nothing ever changes" rant in the cancer ward for the chemo patients as a little pick-me-up. Oh, and FYI, I happen to like the voiceovers on Grey's Anatomy, except for when they're really vague and generic.
30962	J.D.'s narration	And so, in the end, I knew what Elliot said about the way things were has forever changed the way we all thought about them.
30963	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
30964	Elliot	I actually don't mind the new scrubs. It really makes my outfit pop.Look, I know that you feel stupid for falsely accusing Sam, but it all goes away if you just apologize to him.
30965	Dr. Cox	Way ahead of you on that score, Barboo. I wanted to surprise the gentleman with something I thought he'd really enjoy, so I went out and got him a brick of heroin shaped like a heart. Now, if I could just find him a funny card.
30966	Elliot	If you really thought he was still a drug addict, you wouldn't let him counsel people.
30967	Dr. Cox	Of course I would. Addicts make the very best counsellors, because they know just exactly what druggies are going through, mainly because, and see if you can follow this, they're currently going thought it, too.
30968	Elliot	I don't care what you think. I'm always gonna believe in people.
30969	Dr. Cox	All the best with that Barbidiot.
30970	Dr. Kelso	You brought these caca-colored scrubs on yourselves, folks, and thanks for playing along with that hideous suit, Ted.
30971	Ted	Playing along with what, sir?
30972	Dr. Kelso	Nothing. Looking sharp. Wow.
30973	Carla	See? It's fine. Nobody's trying to poison...
30974	Janitor	I knew it! She's gone. Oh, boy, someone's gonna have to tell black doctor. I do not want that job.Zombie!
30975	Carla	I can't do this anymore. I'm out.
30976	Janitor	What? Oh, no, no, toots. You're out when I say you're out. I saw that, Frank.
30977	Carla	Here's the deal. When nobody's looking, we grab Stephen and make him go bye-bye. Then there will only be one dog left. So, when Lurch suddenly shows up with the real Rowdy, Turk will have to assume that he's the one who stole him from the car. Got it?
30978	Laverne	Whatever. Let's do this. Laverne Roberts!
30979	Carla	Laverne, I got the keys right here.
30980	Dr. Kelso	Well, tuna fish on a sponge. She's getting closer.
30981	Maggie	Hey, Bob.
30982	Dr. Kelso	Hey, Maggie. I thought we were gonna take care of that foot.
30983	Maggie	I don't have insurance. It's okay, I can get by.
30984	J.D.'s narration	Everyone reacts differently to unpleasant discoveries. Some people get angry.
30985	Dr. Kelso	Save my seat.
30986	J.D.'s narration	Others are admittedly a tad more dramatic.
30987	J.D.	Oh, my God, he's gone. I think I'm gonna be sick.
30988	Turk	I never got the chance to tell him I loved him.
30989	Same	I mean, guys, I know all about bottoming out. All right? It wasn't long ago that I was out there , on my knees, praying to the gods for help.
30990	J.D.	God, please!
30991	Turk	Lord!
30992	J.D. and Turk	Please, God!
30993	Turk	Bring him back!
30994	J.D.	Why?
30995	Turk	Bring back our Rowdy!
30996	Sam	That was weird. Uh, okay, why don't we call it a day, okay? Okay, guys? Proud of you, proud of you, proud of you, proud of you .
30997	Same	Are you... are you seriously doing the clichéd sarcastic slow clap? Because that is way too 1980s.
30998	Dr. Cox	It was a hell of a performance. The attitude, the indignation. It was damn near believable, do you know that?
30999	Sam	Honestly, I don't really feel the need to convince you of anything, but I will say that if you're waiting to watch me slip, I think things are gonna get really frustrating for you.
31000	Lloyd	Let me tell you something, man. This guy is amazing, okay? He's unbelievable. To even get into his class, you have to bring any drugs you have at home so you're not tempted.
31001	Dr. Cox	Let's see if I've got this right. You have to give your drugs to him?
31002	Lloyd	Oh, absolutely, yeah. Oh, that reminds me. Uh, I found these in my dryer.
31003	Sam	Thank you, Lloyd. Thank you.He's doing very well.
31004	Dr. Cox	Even I have to admit, that was pretty darn clever.
31005	Sam	Thanks. I, uh... I came up with it when I was shooting up with my sponsor in the back of his El Camino. Crazy!
31006	Dr. Cox	I'm gonna go ahead and take this whole moment, I'm gonna find Dr. Barbie and I'm gonna rub it in her face.
31007	Janitor	Well, howdy, boys! 'Member me?
31008	Ted	Ghost dog! Ghost dog!
31009	Janitor	You forced my hand.
31010	Turk	Gimme that!
31011	J.D.	How dare you steal our dog?
31012	Janitor	Huh?
31013	Carla	Sorry, you lose, bye-bye. Oh, and you should still have someone check your coffee before you drink it.
31014	Janitor	Squid oil. That's one for you, Frank.
31015	Dr. Cox	Barbie, I have the most exciting news to tell you!
31016	Dr. Kelso	What the hell people? I saw Maggie Kent in the park. Why didn't we treat her?
31017	Carla	She has no insurance.
31018	Dr. Kelso	Well, why didn't we do what we always do? Why didn't you fix it while I turned my back and pretend not to notice? You know the dance.
31019	J.D.	We used to, but if you're gonna threaten to fire us over taking a pair of scrubs, why wouldn't we think you'd fire us for treating an uninsured patient?
31020	Turk	Yeah, when you took away the scrubs, you took away the trust, and without trust, everything falls apart.
31021	J.D.'s narration	And just like that, we got our old scrubs back.
31022	J.D.	I'm telling you guys, this could have been a much bigger moment.
31023	J.D.'s narration	Even though I was the only one who knew how to embrace life, we all left thinking about how important trust is.Dr. Cox let Elliot keep her trust in humankind a while longer.
31024	Dr. Cox	I, uh... I just wanted to apologize to you, Sam, for not believing in you.
31025	Sam	Thanks.Well, why didn't you tell her?
31026	Dr. Cox	'Cause this hospital will eventually make her just as cynical as everybody else in the dump. She didn't need my help on that one. By the way, do me a favor. If you do use later, don't drive.
31027	Sam	I take the bus, dude.
31028	Dr. Cox	Yeah.
31029	J.D.'s narration	Carla protected the trust that we have in her by coming clean.
31030	Carla	Anyway, I should have told you guys I lost him back then, but, hopefully, this'll help you forgive me.
31031	Turk	Whoa!Look at them standing next to each other. Two beautiful dead dogs.
31032	Carla	Now, at least, you can both have one.
31033	J.D.	I'm cool with keeping Stephen. We've gotten to know each other quite well.
31034	Turk	Well, how are we supposed to know who's who?
31035	J.D.	That's Stephen. Don't ask me how I know that.
31036	J.D.'s narration	As for Dr. Kelso, he knew that trusting us again was probably foolish.
31037	The Todd	Good night, sir.
31038	J.D.'s narration	Still, it was worth it.
31039	Maggie	You want half my sandwich?
31040	Dr. Kelso	Thank you, Mrs. Suarez.
31041	Maggie	It's Kent, Bob. Maggie...
31042	Dr. Kelso	Shhh!
31043	Maggie	Thank you.
