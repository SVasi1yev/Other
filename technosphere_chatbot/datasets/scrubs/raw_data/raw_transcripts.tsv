1	Open	J.D.'s bedroom. "Away" by Leroy begins to play. Close up of a digital clock clicking over from 5:59 to 6:00. The alarm goes off and a sock-covered foot reaches over to tap it off. Pull back to reveal J.D., in pajama bottoms and a t-shirt, stretched sideways across his disheveled bed. He sits up.
2	J.D.'s narration	Since I was a kid, I've been able to sleep through anything - storms, sirens, you name it. Last night, I didn't sleep.
3	J.D.'s narration	I guess I get a little goofy when I'm nervous.
4	J.D.'s narration	You see, today isn't just any other day. It's my first day.
5	J.D.	I'm the man.
6	J.D.'s narration	And four years of pre-med, four years of med school, and tons of unpaid loans have made me realize one thing...
7	Nurse Kearney	Good. Could you go drop an NG tube on the patient in 234, and call the attending that the lavage is positive?
8	J.D.'s narration	I don't know jack.
9	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
10	J.D.'s narration	So, this is my story.
11	J.D.	Uh, I'm supposed to be up in intensive care.
12	Nurse Kearney	Good. We just turfed him there.
13	J.D.'s narration	Look, I became a doctor because I wanted to help people. But orientation yesterday... it didn't really focus on patient care.
14	Lawyer	The hospital doesn't want to be sued. Being sued is not a good thing.
15	J.D.	Hey, Turk.
16	Turk	'Sup.
17	J.D.	You know how I'm totally down with the rap music?
18	Turk	Dude, be whiter.
19	J.D.'s narration	Chris Turk's my best friend. We roomed together in college...
20	J.D.'s narration	We roomed together in med school...
21	J.D.'s narration	Hell, we even got accepted by the same hospital.
22	J.D.	Here's the thing: TuPac, DMX, Dr. Dre, in most of their songs, these artists use an extremely volatile racial slur... the "N" word.
23	Turk	I got it.
24	J.D.	Right. My question is this: if we're both singing along, and knowing that otherwise I would never use the word, am I allowed to say-
25	Turk	No.
26	J.D.	See, that's good for me to know. I didn't-I didn't know that.
27	Lawyer	Finally, doctors, if there is a mistake, don't admit it to the patient. Of course, if the patient is deceased, and you're sure, you can feel free to tell him or her... anything.
28	J.D.	Hey, listen, I found us an apartment....
29	Dr. Kelso	Okay, gang. I'm Dr. Bob Kelso, and I'm your Chief of Medicine. So, I just want to encourage you all to think of me as your safety net. Because, I promise you, we're family here.
30	Dr. Kelso	Now, then, go get 'em, doctors.
31	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
32	Turk	So, the surgical interns are gonna go grab a beer.
33	J.D.	The medical interns are having a PacMan tournament.
34	J.D.	...Apparently we're all twelve.
35	Elliot	I love PacMan.
36	J.D.	Me too. I love watching it, I love playing it, I love all of it.
37	Elliot	I'm Elliot.
38	Turk	Eeellliiiiooott...
39	Elliot	Yeah. Don't do that.
40	J.D.	I'm J.D., this is Turk.
41	Turk	Elliot, are you medical, or surgical?
42	Elliot	Medical.
43	J.D.'s narration	Heh-heh. Hello.
44	Elliot	So, every male in my family is a doctor: my dad, my grand-dad, and my brother. I guess that's why dad gave me a guy's name, made me play sports, date girls. I'm joking.
45	J.D.	I know. I would have laughed if you'd paused.
46	Elliot	Anyway, I know what you're thinking.
47	J.D.'s narration	Your butt looks like two Pringles hugging.
48	J.D.	No you don't.
49	Elliot	I'm probably "Miss Hyper Competitive". I mean, it used to be a big problem for me. "Used to" - past tense.
50	J.D.	Hey, are we, like, racing?
51	Elliot	Yes!
52	J.D.'s narration	Please. I'm not that desperate.
53	Elliot	So, you do a lot of cardio, or...?
54	J.D.	Oh, yeah.
55	Dr. Steadman	Elliot Reid? John Dorian? Great. One: I am your resident, Dr. Jeffrey Steadman - not "Jeff". Two: Here are your manuals. This -
56	J.D.'s narration	You ever notice how quickly some people make an impression?
57	Dr. Steadman	I'm a tool. I'm a tool. I'm a tool, tool, tool, an unbelievably annoying tool.
58	J.D.	Yeah.
59	Dr. Steadman	Yeah. Finally, these are your beepers . From now on, they control your entire life. 'Kay? Thanks. Move it.
60	J.D.'s narration	Back to today.
61	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
62	J.D.	Uh, I was paged.
63	Carla	Aww, first day, Bambi? Carla will take care of you. Don't look at me when we're moving someone.
64	J.D.	Why?
65	Carla	We're waiting for Dr. Cox.
66	J.D.	Hi, doctor, I'm-
67	Dr. Cox	Place an IV for me.
68	J.D.	We'll talk later.
69	Dr. Cox	Carla, can I ask you a personal question? Do you spray the perfume on or just fill your bathtub up and splash around in it?
70	Carla	I smell nice.
71	J.D.'s narration	Come on, you've done this to cadavers before. So this guy's alive, just poke it through his skin! Poke it through! Now!
72	Dr. Cox	Time's up. Carla, would you do it for him, please? I also need an A.B.G.
73	J.D.	Why are you telling her?
74	Dr. Cox	Shut up and watch.
75	Carla	Be nice to Bambi!
76	Dr. Cox	Why does this GOMER got to try and die everyday during my lunch?
77	J.D.	That's a little insensitive.
78	J.D.'s narration	Mistake.
79	Dr. Cox	Man's 92 years old, he has full dementia, he doesn't even know we're here, he's inches from Carla's rack and he hasn't even flinched.
80	Carla	Aww, that is so sweet.
81	Dr. Cox	Yeah, it is.
82	J.D.	What about his subconscious?
83	Dr. Cox	Eisenhower was a sissy.
84	Dr. Cox	I think by the grace of God we're gonna be okay. Oh, and from now on, whenever I'm in the room, you're definitely not allowed to talk.
85	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
86	Dr. Kelso	Now...Dr. Dorian, can you tell me what ailment most often....
87	J.D.'s Narration	I think I'm gonna love rounds. It's like being on a gameshow.
88	J.D.	What is euremia?
89	Dr. Kelso	That's my boy!
90	Dr. Kelso	Hey, nice, clean job on the foley catheter.
91	J.D.'s Narration	I'd had a nurse do it. Unfortunately, I'm still afraid to touch anybody.
92	J.D.'s Narration	I've been thinking a lot about Elliot.
93	J.D.'s Narration	...A whole lot.
94	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Reid, you're late.
95	Elliot	I got puked on.
96	Dr. Kelso	You're off the hook if you can tell me what to look for in a euremic patient.
97	J.D.'s Thoughts	Anyway...I'm going for it.
98	J.D.	Infection.
99	Elliot	Infection?
100	Dr. Kelso	That's my girl!
101	Dr. Kelso	Moving on.
102	Elliot	I knew the answer!
103	J.D.	I'm sure you did.
104	Elliot	I was just frazzled.
105	J.D.	Well, how could you not be....
106	Elliot	You know with the...
107	J.D.	Oh, I know. Yeah.
108	Elliot	Good. But thanks. If there's anything I can ever do for you, just
109	J.D.	You could let me take you to dinner tomorrow night.
110	J.D.	Around seven.... Or eight.
111	Elliot	Why not.
112	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
113	J.D.'s Thoughts	"Why not." That's what she said. "Why not"!
114	Boy	Daddy, why did you marry mommy?
115	J.D.	Well, Tiger, I gave her an answer during rounds, and she screwed my brains out.
116	Boy	You the man!
117	Dr. Cox	What the hell are you doing?
118	Dr. Cox	Did you actually just page me to find out how much Tylenol to give to Mrs. Lendsner?
119	J.D.	I was worried that it could exacerbate the patient's
120	Dr. Cox	It's regular-strength Tylenol! Here's what'cha do: Get her to open her mouth, take a handful, and throw it at her. Whatever sticks, that's the correct dosage.
121	J.D.	But I
122	Dr. Cox	And under no circumstances are you to compromise our "no talking" agreement.
123	J.D.	Dr. Kelso, he's always telling me, you know, "You've gotta stay positive!"
124	Dr. Cox	I'm gonna go ahead and say this just as carefully as possible so I don't overstate it: Dr. Kelso is the most evil human being on the planet. And may, in fact, be Satan, himself.
125	J.D.	It's just that, this isn't really what I expected... You know...
126	J.D.	Most of my patients are, uh...older and sorta checked-out, mentally.
127	Dr. Cox	Pumpkin, that's modern medicine. Advances that keep people alive who should have died a long time ago, back when they lost what made them people.
128	Dr. Cox	Now, your job is to stay sane enough so that when someone does come in that you actually can help, you're not so brain-dead that you can't function. For the love of God, what!?
129	J.D.	It's just that, do you really think we should be talking about this in front of....
130	Dr. Cox	Her? She's dead.
131	Dr. Cox	Write this down, newbie: If you push around a stiff, nobody'll ask you to do anything.
132	J.D.	You've been like a father to me.
133	Dr. Cox	Fair enough, you want some real advice? If they find out the nurses are doing your procedures for you, your ass'll be kicked outta here so quick, it'll make your head spin.
134	J.D.'s Thoughts	And there it is.
135	Dr. Cox	Have a terrific day.
136	Elderly Lady	I'm not really dead.
137	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
138	Carla	Okay, Bambi, here's Mrs. Lendsner's tox-screen.
139	J.D.'s Thoughts	I wonder if Turk's having the same experience I am.
140	Turk	I am such a stud!
141	J.D.'s Thoughts	Probably not
142	Turk	This morning, I had my hands inside of a guy's chest. I couldn't even see them! I should not be allowed to do stuff like that. Whazzup.
143	J.D.	And you weren't scared?
144	Turk	One way or another, everyone stops bleeding. That is so deep.
145	Carla	No it isn't.
146	Turk	It's a little deep.
147	J.D.	Hey, we never got to talk about the apartment, I wanted to
148	Todd	T-man!
149	Turk	Word up, boy; how ya doin', man.
150	Todd	All right.
151	Turk	All right, Todd, J.D.; J.D., this is my man, Todd.
152	J.D.	Oww!
153	J.D.'s Narration	And like that, I was back in high school. You see, surgical interns, they're all slice-'em-and-dice-'em. They're the jocks. Medical interns, we're trained to think about the body; diagnose, test. Medical interns, well....
154	Todd	Hey, you got a stain.
155	J.D.'s Narration	....We're the chess club.
156	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
157	Mr. Bursky	I just have bad gas. What are you testing me for?
158	J.D.	We need to know if your gas could be harmful to others.
159	J.D.'s Thoughts	He's just scared. Talk to him.
160	J.D.	Look, Mr. Bursky, I heard a systolic murmur in your heart, which is most likely nothing. But if you don't let me check you out, I'm gonna worry about you all day.
161	Mr. Bursky	Then I'll do it. For you.
162	J.D.	You're a good man.
163	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
164	Cut to	hospital interior, where J.D. is patiently standing behind the janitor, who is on a ladder, working on an elevator door.
165	J.D.	I'm I'm waiting for someone.
166	Janitor	The door is broke. Maybe the fifth time or so. It don't open.
167	J.D.	Maybe there's a penny stuck in there?
168	Janitor	Why a penny?
169	J.D.	I dunno.
170	Janitor	Did you stick a penny in there?
171	J.D.	No. I was I was just making small talk.
172	Janitor	If I find a penny in there, I'm taking you down.

174	Dr. Kelso	Welcome to rounds, kids. Let's
175	J.D.'s Narration	Elliot is the only thing keeping me from losing my mind. She's my dream girl.
176	Dr. Kelso	...The necrosis and infected stool most likely indicate what, Dr...... Dorian?
177	Elliot	I don't know!
178	J.D.	Sir, I have no idea.
179	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Reid, can you help him out?
180	Elliot	I'd say it's superior mesenteric insufficiency.
181	Dr. Kelso	That's my girl! Patient number two!
182	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
183	J.D.'s Thoughts	Draining Mrs. Pratt's stomach fluid'll get my spirits back up.
184	J.D.	Circles for you.
185	Mrs. Pratt	Shut up and do it.
186	J.D.'s Thoughts	Fantastic.
187	J.D.'s Thoughts	Just suck out the fluid with the giant needle.
188	J.D.	I think this needle's too big. I'm gonna get a nurse.
189	Turk	Come on, man, learn by doing! Learn by doing.
190	J.D.'s Narration	Why couldn't I do that? I hated him at that moment.
191	Turk	Okay, uh, maybe the needle was just a little too big.
192	J.D.	Oh, you think?
193	Mrs. Pratt	What's going on down there?
194	Turk	Nothing, ma'am, this is totally normal.
195	J.D.	So, are you gonna are you gonna move your stuff in or what?
196	Turk	That's why I came by. I think it's better if we both branched out a little. What do you think?
197	J.D.'s Thoughts	Tell him you think that's stupid. Tell him you need him.
198	J.D.	Yeah, I... I feel the same way.
199	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
200	Mr. Bursky	So, what's it like being a young, hot-shot doctor?
201	J.D.	It's like... Did you ever go see a movie that everyone told you was great, and then because of all those expectations, you ended up totally disappointed?
202	Mr. Bursky	Movies nowadays have too many special effects.
203	J.D.	Yeah, that was pretty much my point.
204	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
205	J.D.'s Narration	My first code. See, here's how it works: Someone's heart fails, they beep everyone. The first doctor in has to run the room, tell everyone what to do.... Basically decide if the patient lives or dies. What am I, crazy?
206	J.D.	Agh! You chicken!
207	J.D.'s Narration	Don't worry about the patient, Turk was already there.... 'Learning by doing.'
208	Todd	Charge!
209	Turk	Clear!
210	J.D.'s Narration	Plus, it turns out, the guy was just sleeping; attached to a faulty monitor.
211	J.D.	I thought we cared about each other....
212	Elliot	Oh please, if you didn't want to sleep with me, you'd have done the same thing.
213	J.D.	Well, I'll tell you one thing, the last thing in the world I wanna do is sleep wit'cha now!
214	Elliot	Do me right here.
215	J.D.	Okay.
216	Elliot	See!
217	J.D.	ARGH!
218	Dr. Cox	Right. Pass me a trach. kit.
219	Dr. Cox	Thanks.
220	J.D.	Our date is is totally canceled!
221	Elliot	Pff!
222	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
223	J.D.'s Narration	I was sitting on the floor for two reasons. One, I tried to lock Elliot in that supply closet, and she kicked me hard. And two, the on call-room was locked.
224	J.D.	Come on! I got, like, ten minutes to sleep!
225	Turk	Wait. Tell me if I'm going too fast, okay?
226	Carla	Lose the clothes.
227	J.D.'s Thoughts	I heard that Turk was gonna move in with Todd. I'm surprised that high-fiving freak isn't in there with him.
228	Todd	Damn, this is hot.
229	Carla	Nice.
230	Turk	Your turn.
231	Carla	No, I gotta get back. But, very nice.
232	Carla	Oh, hey, Bambi!
233	Turk	So, uhh, I'll call you, okay?
234	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
235	Dr. Cox	Give me a big "ah".
236	Billy	Ah.
237	Dr. Cox	A big boy "ah".
238	Billy	Ahhh!
239	J.D.	Turk practically had sex in the on-call room.
240	Dr. Cox	You realize, of course, I have no idea who Turk is.
241	Dr. Cox	...But, good for him. You see, Billy, it turns out that sex is life-affirming.
242	Dr. Cox	Now, whatta ya say, champ; you got a urine sample in there for me?
243	Billy	But I just did, five minutes ago.
244	Dr. Cox	I know you did, but here's the thing: I'd like you to take this cup, put it on the ground, close your eyes, and just go nuts! Whatta ya say!
245	Billy	Cool!
246	Dr. Cox	Atta boy! Go get 'em, champ!
247	Dr. Cox	Why are you here?
248	J.D.	Seems like a good kid.
249	Dr. Cox	You're worried about being on-call tonight, aren't you.
250	J.D.'s Thoughts	Yeah.
251	Dr. Cox	Look, worst case scenario, you kill somebody, and that hangs over your head the rest of your life.
252	Dr. Cox	...But that is the absolute worst case scenario. Come on, newbie, look: Just have the nurses do all the stuff you're still too chicken to do, which I assume covers just about everything, and if you have a really rough admission
253	J.D.	Call you?
254	Dr. Cox	No! I was gonna say go hide in the closet again!
255	Billy	Yee-ha! This is fun!

257	A Staff Member	Hey, nurse?
258	Elliot	I'm a doctor, okay? The stethoscope, the beeper a doctor, got it?
259	Carla	Relax.
260	Elliot	I just hate it. I hate the "darlin's" I hate the "sweethearts"...
261	Carla	You don't need to tell me how hard it is being a woman around here.
262	Elliot	Well, you're certainly furthering the cause by wearing a thong to work and hooking up in the on-call room.
263	Elliot	Word gets around.
264	Carla	You talk like that, do you even know my name?
265	Carla	I spend every second of my life either here, or taking care of my mom. So, yeah, maybe I needed a little closeness. I'm sure you never had a quickie at the club, right? Or snuck some skinny, flat-butted college boy up to your sorority room. And my thong? I happen to think it makes my ass look good. And some days, I need to feel good about something around here. And you judge me? Well, guess what, word does get around, Miss "Out For Herself", so you can dump on everyone here if you want; but you will not hurt me.

271	"THAT NIGHT	6 SECONDS BEFORE GOING ON CALL"
272	Cut to	Interior The Doctors' Lounge.
273	Dr. Kelso	Hey, Champ! First night on call starts soon, huh? Gosh, you must be excited.
274	J.D.'s Thoughts	Agghh!
275	J.D.	You bet'cha.
276	Dr. Kelso	Oh! About Mrs. Pratt.... I heard you wanted to put her on the hospital's transplant list. I just thought I'd recommend keeping her on dialysis a little while longer, maybe we'll get lucky!
277	J.D.	No problem, sir.
278	Dr. Kelso	Great! Have a ball...on call! A little poem for you.
279	As he nervously enters the crowded hospital waiting room, David Gray's "Please Forgive Me" begins to play. We see scenes of J.D.'s experience on-call	Wincing as he steadies a patient for a procedure. Filling out a chart for a man in drag. Checking the monitor of a sleeping patient, and taking a quick bite from the man's untouched food. Attempting to insert an IV, and having the nurse step in to help. Then finally settling down on the bed in the on-call room. As he flicks off the light, Carla steps in, turning it back on and summoning him.
280	Carla	Bambi, come on. Let's go.
281	J.D.	I'll check on you every ten minutes, Mrs. Moreno, okay?
282	Nurse Roberts	I need to see you in Mr. Bursky's room.
283	J.D.	Are you flirting with me?
284	J.D.	You are, aren't you!
285	Nurse Roberts	He crashed. The attending thinks it was a pulmonary embolism.
286	Nurse Roberts	No way anyone could have caught it. Anyhow, you have to pronounce him.
287	J.D.	Why didn't anybody page me?
288	Nurse Roberts	Could you just pronounce him so I can go home?
289	J.D.'s Narration	I'll never forget that moment, the way he looked exactly the same...only completely different. The shame that all I could think about was how hard this was for me.
290	J.D.	Time of death 0200.
291	J.D.'s Narration	I just wanted to help people.
292	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
293	J.D.'s Narration	The hardest part is how quickly you have to move on.
294	J.D.	Don't worry, man. You're gonna be fine.
295	Turk	Hey. I lied before, man. I'm scared every second.
296	J.D.	Really?
297	Turk	It's a good thing they make surgical masks, 'cause if they didn't, everyone would know that my face is like this the whole time...
298	J.D.	Well, I think it's okay to be scared.
299	Turk	Well, I need you to tell me that every once in a while, man.
300	J.D.'s Thoughts	He needs me?
301	Turk	Anyway, I just came to check up on you; see how you're doing.
302	J.D.'s Thoughts	Ask him to move in again.
303	J.D.	You know, Turk, the offer still stands if you wanna....
304	Turk	Dude, I already took the keys out' your bag.
305	Turk	I love you.
306	Cut to	A Hospital Hallway.
307	J.D.'s Narration	And like that, I got a second wind.
308	Janitor	I'm watching you....
309	Dr. Kelso	How're you holding up?
310	J.D.'s Thoughts	Ah, there he is, my safety net.
311	Dr. Kelso	I saw that you're still pushing to put Mrs. Pratt on the transplant list. Bad news, though, sport: she doesn't have the insurance to cover it.
312	J.D.	Yeah, but she's, like, a second away from total renal failure.
313	Dr. Kelso	Okay..... Uh, did you ask the Bursky family for permission to do an autopsy?
314	J.D.	They're still in there with him, sir.
315	Dr. Kelso	It's a teaching hospital, son, you gotta ask.
316	J.D. Thoughts	Just tell him you can't see Mr. Bursky again. He'll understand.
317	J.D.	Sir, do you do you think I could skip just this one?
318	Dr. Kelso	Why, sure, sport.
319	J.D.'s Narration	See? Every story needs a good guy.
320	Dr. Kelso	In fact, why don't you just head on home. You look kinda tired.
321	J.D.	I am pretty tired!
322	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Dorian, do you not realize that you're nothing but a large pair of scrubs to me? For God's sake, the only reason I carry this chart around is so I can pretend to remember your damn names! Now look, if the patient has insurance, you treat them; if they don't, you show them the door.
323	Dr. Kelso	And if somebody dies, you get the autopsy. You get it by rounds tomorrow morning, or I'll be scratching your name off my chart! Are we clear!?
324	Dr. Kelso	Answer me!!!
325	J.D.	Crystal clear.
326	Dr. Kelso	Great, sport.
327	J.D.'s Narration	I don't get it, if he's the jerk, then who's the good guy?
328	Carla	Car accident, crashed in the elevator on the way up.
329	Dr. Cox	We gotta relieve the pressure in his chest. J.D., do it.
330	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh God, no.
331	Dr. Cox	Look at me. You can do this.
332	J.D.'s Narration	And I believed him...
333	J.D.	Chest-tube tray.
334	J.D.'s Narration	...You know, kinda.
335	Dr. Cox	Come on, baby, let's go; chop-chop.
336	J.D.'s Thoughts	You can do this. You have to do this.
337	Dr. Cox	J.D., cut him or lose him.
338	J.D.	Okay, gimme the tube.
339	J.D.	I can't get it through the pleura.
340	Dr. Cox	Well, don't be gentle, get it in there.
341	J.D.	Okay, connect it, please, Carla.
342	Carla	Normal rhythm.
343	J.D.	No way!
344	Dr. Cox	Eh? It's a piece of cake.
345	Dr. Cox	That's your patient.
346	J.D.	You're leaving?
347	Dr. Cox	That's your patient, doctor.
348	Carla	G'head.
349	Carla	That's enough.
350	J.D.	Sorry. It's a very big moment for me.
351	Carla	Mm-hmm.
352	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
353	J.D.'s Narration	So, I guess that's it for now. Thirty-one hours, twelve minutes, and I am....
354	Elliot	You're finally off?
355	J.D.	Almost. I have one more really annoying thing I gotta do.
356	Elliot	If you're talking about getting the Bursky autopsy, I already called the family for you. And they said fine, and to thank you, and I'm sorry. ...They didn't say that last part, I did.
357	J.D.'s Narration	The worst part was knowing, right then, that I could never forgive her.
358	J.D.'s Thoughts	I forgive her.
359	J.D.'s Narration	You see, I can't survive on my own.
360	Dr. Steadman	I'm a dork. I'm a dork! I'm a dork. ...I'm a dork.
361	J.D.'s Narration	Even now, when I finally get to go home, in the back of my head, I'll know the hospital's still here, wide awake.
362	Carla	Bambi! Get out while you still can.
363	J.D.'s Narration	But what the hell. The most important thing is that I got through my first three days without looking like a complete idiot.
364	J.D.	I'm the man.
365	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
366	J.D.'s Narration	The human brain is remarkable. Once a day for nine years, I thought I lost my watch 'cause I can't remember which wrist it's on.
367	J.D.'s Narration	And yet, just after two weeks, all the little things that scared me at first are like second nature. Catheters, chest tubes, IVs...
368	J.D.'s Narration	...Everything has started to click.
369	He reaches down to turn on his walkman, Leroy's "Good Time" begins to play. He looks around the activity of the hospital to see that everyone is working to the beat of the music playing in his ears. When his patient suddenly wakes up and mouths some of the words to the song, J.D. looks up, somewhat confused by the surreal moment. Dr. Kelso is now directly in front of him, exaggeratedly lip-sync'ing the chorus of the song	"Are you having a good time?"
370	Dr. Kelso	Are you? Because if you have time to listen to music, then I assume you have time to finish your paperwork!
371	Janitor	"...Having a good time...."
372	Janitor	Keep movin'.
373	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
374	J.D.'s Narration	That workday started like every other.
375	Cut to	Hospital, interior - Admissions Area.
376	J.D.	How's it going?
377	Janitor	I'm 37 years old, and I'm a janitor; how do you think it's going?
378	J.D.	Now, there is nothing wrong with being a janitor.
379	Janitor	Really? Thank you. You...you've turned my life around. I'm gonna have to go tell my janitor wife and all our janitor kids that life is worth living; and that comes straight from our hero, Dr. Whoozitz.... Dr. Nothin'.
380	Janitor	No, seriously, come on. You can come over to my humble house and point out things that are cheap.
381	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
382	J.D.'s Narration	Luckily, I had that night off to regroup.
383	Cut to	Interior - the living room.
384	Elliot	Your dog is creepy.
385	J.D.	Aww... be nice to Rowdy. The guy we bought him from used to keep him in a box full of old hats.
386	Elliot	Ew.
387	Turk	Okay, dude, why is she here all the time?
388	J.D.	Just give her a chance, man.
389	Turk	Ohh... you want to hit that!
390	J.D.	Nooo....
391	Turk	Yeah!
392	J.D.	No. She's just a friend, man.
393	Turk	Yeah.
394	J.D.	I think it's healthy hanging out with a girl without the ultimate goal being sex. You know?
395	Turk	I'm not following you.
396	Elliot	Creepy.... I had a run-in with that Nurse Carla yesterday. She forgot to check out the stats on a patient, and then she gave me attitude about it.
397	J.D.	What'd you tell on her, or something?
398	Dr. Kelso	Who's responsible for this?
399	Elliot	She is.
400	Elliot	I don't remember... And why would you automatically assume it was my fault?
401	J.D.'s Thoughts	It would be a good point, except that Elliot puts her foot in her mouth. A lot. She can't really seem to stop.
402	Elliot	Just because I occasionally say something stupid doesn't mean I'm in the hospital going door to door annoying people, like some crazed Jehovah's Witness.
403	Elliot	Oh. You're not?
404	Turk	No.
405	Turk	But my mother is.
406	J.D.	He's black, too. You should tease him about that.
407	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
408	J.D.'s Narration	Me, I'm doing better with new people. Like Carla, for instance.
409	Carla	Hey, Bambi; that blond stick you hang out with? Tell her...Que se cuide la nalguita esa, porque si no le voy a tumbar todo el tinte rubio de la cabeza.
410	J.D.	You might have to write that down for me.
411	J.D.'s Narration	And Dr. Cox, we've really connected.
412	J.D.'s Narration	I'm kinda like his protege.
413	Dr. Cox	I need to see his chart
414	J.D.	Done. Copied. And Highlighted.
415	Dr. Cox	Unfortunately, Radar, I'm fresh out of gold stars. Multilobar pneumonia at 31...? How much does this guy smoke?
416	J.D.	I dunno.
417	Dr. Cox	You realize, of course, it's your attention to detail that impresses me most. How many packs a day, genius.
418	Will	Half a pack.
419	Dr. Cox	Oh, I'm sorry, I phrased the question wrong. How many packs a day... really.
420	Will	Eleven.
421	Will	Now you don't know where I'm coming from!
422	Will	Two or three packs.
423	Dr. Cox	Well, let's hear it...
424	J.D.	Oh, I don't smoke, so... zero packs.
425	Carla	What tests have you ordered?
426	J.D.	Oh. I know, I was just totally kidding with you.
427	Will	He was... We're all in on it.
428	J.D.'s Thoughts	I like Will. That actually makes this harder.
429	J.D.	I ordered blood cultures, and a high-resolution CT.
430	Will	What are you looking for?
431	Dr. Cox	Cancer.
432	J.D.'s Thoughts	When you say the word "cancer", every person reacts the same way.
433	Will	Excellent.
434	J.D.'s Thoughts	Not like that.
435	J.D.'s Thoughts	There it is.
436	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
437	J.D.'s Narration	I never really know what to say to Turk's stupid surgery buddies. But I'm getting better.
438	J.D.	So....How's surgery?
439	Todd	It rocks... But my bedroom, that's where I really operate! Am I right? Come on, show Todd some love!
440	J.D.'s Thoughts	I hate showing Todd love.
441	Carla	Hey, Bambi. Why are you over here slumming with these scalpel jocks?
442	Turk	Please baby, this, here, is the V.I.P table.
443	Turk	Why don't you sit your fine self down?
444	J.D.	"Baby, this, here, is the V.I.P table..."
445	Turk	I'm not really interested in her.
446	Todd	Yeah? Then maybe the Todd'll show that little biscuit some love!
447	J.D.'s Thoughts	Maybe he's a little interested.
448	Todd	Fine. Todd'll show himself some love.
449	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
450	Turk	I'm thinking about asking Carla out today. What do you think?
451	J.D.	I think the janitor's out to get me.
452	Turk	Wow. Thank you so much for your help. You know what? Why don't you be just a little bit more paranoid.
453	J.D.	Wait, Turk.
454	Janitor	That's him.
455	Cut to	Nurses' Station.
456	Elliot	Hi, how are you? Um... I need, uh, David Farr's chart?
457	Nurse Roberts	We all need lots of things.
458	Elliot	Great.
459	Elliot	Uh, Dr. Kelso! You're the Chief of Medicine, is there a 'special' way to communicate with the nursing staff that I'm not getting?
460	Dr. Kelso	Well, uh, sugar won't work because they're already so sweet.
461	Dr. Kelso	Now, listen Dr...Whatever-the-hell-your-name-is, you tattled yesterday, I responded I feel closer to you than ever, really but the ramifications are yours. So don't try to drag me into your pathetic, whiny, little squabble with that God-awful bunch of malcontents. I hope you all kill each other! Have a great day, ladies.
462	Elliot	I hate this place.
463	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
464	J.D.	Dr. Cox; I got, uh, Will's CT results back. No cancer! So, uh, what should I tell him?
465	Dr. Cox	I'd open with that.
466	J.D.	Right, it's just, you know, he's headed down such a bad road, I thought you and I could talk to him....
467	J.D.'s Narration	When you really lock in with a mentor, you start to understand the meaning behind their words.
468	Dr. Cox	You do whatever you want.
469	J.D.'s Narration	Means, "Great idea!"
470	Dr. Cox	I'm, um, I'm just happy you haven't messed up yet today.
471	J.D.'s Narration	Means, "You're really coming along as a doctor."
472	Dr. Cox	Don't. Ever. Touch me.
473	J.D.'s Narration	Means, Don't ever touch him.
474	J.D.	Just thought it was a nice moment.
475	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
476	Elliot	No, I don't wanna.
477	J.D.	No, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon.
478	Elliot	Carla...I...shouldn't have told Dr. Kelso on you.
479	Carla	No, you shouldn't have.
480	J.D.'s Thoughts	Ahhh, the comfortable silences.
481	Carla	But thank you for apologizing.
482	J.D.	Okay, good!
483	Elliot	I I just want to make one thing clear.
484	J.D.	No, see, nothing needs to be clear.
485	Elliot	I still think you were in the wrong. Checking for the statics is your job, and I need to know that you're going to take care of it.
486	Cut to	a shot of Elliot's perspective from inside the grave. Carla, dressed in black, coldly flicks the ashes from a cigarette into the grave.
487	Elliot	That's all I'm saying.
488	Elliot	There. All better!
489	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
490	J.D.	So... yes! As of now, you have no signs of cancer.
491	Will	Woo! Who rules? Will rules!
492	J.D.	Uh, Will, it's important you realize this isn't great news.
493	Will	Are you sure? 'Cause, that's how it first hit me.
494	J.D.	Yeah, well, Will, you're on a slippery slope, man.
495	J.D.'s Narration	I had to scare him, but I had the sense he'd heard it all before. Luckily, part of being a doctor is your ability to improvise.
496	J.D.	So, right now, the one thing that I want you to think about...
497	J.D.	...How would you like to sound like this?
498	Will	Let me see.
499	Will	This is so cool!
500	J.D.	No, it's not.
501	Will	Bwiddy-bwiddy-bwiddy. Okay, doc.
502	J.D.	It's not a toy.
503	J.D.	Would you like to play a game?
504	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes, if all you have is old words, all you can do is put them together and hope they say something new.
505	J.D.	Look, man, you're a great patient. I like you enough to hope I never see you again. But, I promise you, if you keep smoking, you'll be back here. I bet my own life on that.
506	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
507	Intercom	Dr. Reid to room 402. Then down to 201. Then back up to room 403.
508	Turk	I'm nervous, man. Why am I nervous?
509	Todd	Todd's your wing-man, buddy. I will not leave your side. Hey, baby.
510	Carla	Keep moving, frat boy.
511	Todd	You got it.
512	Carla	Come on. Out with it.
513	Turk	Don't rush me!
514	Turk	I mean... You shouldn't be impatient with what I think is the opportunity of a lifetime.
515	Carla	Mmm. Okay, so I'm gonna go sit down because, you're so sexy, my knees are weak.
516	Turk	Really?
517	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
518	J.D.	Oh, Dr. Cox, I know I'm being annoying. But I I'm really getting used to talking to patients. I mean, this is why I became a doctor; right? Right?
519	Dr. Cox	I heard "I know I'm being annoying," and then...white noise.
520	J.D.	Will, the pneumonia patient, I got him to quit smoking.
521	Dr. Cox	Forever?
522	J.D.	Yuh-huh!
523	Dr. Cox	No "last one"? 'Cause the last ones are better than sex, trust me, I've had about a thousand of them.
524	J.D.	Done forever. He swore to me. I just, I reached him! I reached him.
525	Dr. Cox	You're having a big day, there, Susan.
526	Janitor	Private party.
527	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
528	Re-Open	The Doctors' Lounge
529	J.D.'s Thoughts	Gotta get right back up on the horse.
530	J.D.	Dr. Cox, about Will.
531	Dr. Cox	Not now. I have a ten-minute break, and my soap is on.
532	Dr. Cox	Hey, uh, skeetch, if you do go ahead and change the channels, I swear I'll suture your hands together.
533	J.D.	Right, so with Will....
534	Dr. Cox	Oh, this woman is just fantastic. I mean, the breasts are probably fake, but, by God, those tears are real!
535	J.D.'s Thoughts	Time for a bold move.
536	J.D.	I need to know how we're going to fix this thing with Will.
537	Dr. Cox	Do you know what you've just done? You just lost all lap-dog privileges.
538	J.D.	Excuse me?
539	Dr. Cox	No more walkies, no more treats, no more following me around the hospital.
540	J.D.	I'm not your lap-dog.
541	Dr. Cox	Hey you, back there, what do we do with lap-dogs who can't behave in the house.
542	Doug	Make them stay outside?
543	Dr. Cox	That's right. You now have five seconds to get out of this room, otherwise I'm gonna start whacking you on the nose with this.
544	Dr. Cox	Don't laugh. This isn't a joke, newbie. Get. Out.
545	J.D.	But I was thinking that
546	Dr. Cox	GO!
547	Dr. Cox	What do you wanna watch, there, Captain Courage.
548	Doug	'Days of Our Lives'?
549	Dr. Cox	Atta boy.
550	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
551	J.D.	Come in.
552	Turk	Smells the food.
553	Elliot	Hey, move your butt.
554	Elliot	Umm... peace offering?
555	Elliot	Look, Turk, I know that I don't always make the best first impression....Or second, for that matter. Anyway, I'd like us to be friends, and I thought, you know, maybe I could get to know you a bit better....
556	Elliot	....See what you're about.... Uh....
557	Elliot	For instance, when did you meet Morgan Freeman?
558	Turk	That's my mom.
559	Elliot	I like her freckles!
560	Elliot	Geez!!!
561	J.D.	Rowdy, no!
562	J.D.	So, I still can't figure out why Dr. Cox tore me a new one today.
563	Turk	Oh, man, enough already. He's a jerk.
564	Elliot	He's a jerk.
565	Cut to	The Hospital...
566	Doug	He's a jerk!
567	Dr. Kelso	He's a jerk.
568	Janitor	You're a jerk.
569	Carla	He's just Dr. Cox.
570	Carla	He's always like that.
571	J.D.	Well, who really knows him? I mean, who does he hang out with here?
572	Carla	No one.
573	J.D.'s Thoughts	That must be lonely.
574	Carla	"Take two Turks as needed, apply to sensitive area..." Who wrote this?
575	Turk	Whazzup.... Oh, come on, Carla; give me one good reason why you won't go out with me.
576	Carla	Well, you're a surgeon. So, you've got the god-complex, the cockiness, the whole "married to the job" thing. You're cute, but you're very, very aware of it. You have no idea what I'm like, so all of your feelings for me are coming from down there. But most of all, I'm looking for the real thing; and you're nothing but a little boy who's not used to being told "No." So there's a bunch of reasons. Pick your favorite.
577	J.D.	I'd go with the "god-complex".
578	J.D.	But it's hard to choose, you know, they're all so good.
579	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
580	J.D.'s Narration	A hospital is a tricky place. I mean, it's very cliquey, and you have to watch what you say. It's a lot like high school.
581	Dr. Kelso as the principal, and the nurses as the cheerleaders watch Elliot walking past the tables in full "geek" regalia	horn-rim glasses, oral retainer, band uniform. Not watching where she's going, Elliot trips and spills her tray of food all over the floor. The nurses/cheerleaders, surgeons/jocks, and other "students" laugh at her.
582	J.D.'s Narration	I'd like to think that if I didn't have somewhere else to be that I'd gone and sat with her. But, you see, tonight, there's somebody else I have to take care of.
583	Cut to	J.D., in casual clothes, with a 6-pack in hand, approaching the door of an apartment. He rings the bell. The door opens to reveal Dr. Cox. The sounds of a televised sporting event can be heard from inside the apartment.
584	J.D.	I know that watching Will slowly kill himself hurts you, too. That's even harder if you don't have anyone to talk about it with. So, when I got off work, I figured you know I was gonna pick up a few cold ones, right, and then maybe you and I, we'll we'll talk it out, we'll just break the whole thing down. Right? What do you say to that?
585	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
586	Elliot	I'm sick of this, everyone keeps ignoring me. I'm like a damn plague around here.
587	Turk	Please, don't look back at me when you're talking.
588	Dr. Kelso	Oh, uh, Dr. Reid. I just wanted to say you're out of my dog house. That was a great catch on that patient with meningoccocus.
589	Elliot	Well, that actually wasn't me, sir. Carla noticed the rash on his legs.
590	Dr. Kelso	Well, that's fascinating. You could have fallen back into my good graces, and instead you passed the credit on to a nurse.
591	Dr. Kelso	How noble! I'll tell you what, I'll get the cafeteria staff to write "Was it worth it?" on a big cake for you!
592	Turk	Nurses' Station.... So this is the Nurses' Station....
593	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
594	J.D.	Do you think I've damaged the ligaments?
595	Dr. Cox	I don't care.
596	Dr. Cox	Now, can I count on you to never drop by here ever again, or should I just go ahead and move?
597	J.D.	Oh, you can't leave a place with this much warmth. I especially love the shelf filled with personal photos of your friends and family.
598	Shot of	A very sterile-looking glass shelf with several "blank" pieces of modern art.
599	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, if he comes at you, just try and roll out the door.
600	Dr. Cox	Well, actually, you have a point. I guess watching the game by yourself with a scotch isn't, really, the only way to watch a game, huh. I don't know. I just, I've always thought of needing people as a sign of weakness.
601	J.D.	It's not.
602	Dr. Cox	Then, would you stay... and watch the game with me? Maybe have a slice of pizza?
603	J.D.	Of course I will.
604	Dr. Cox	I can braid your hair.
605	Dr. Cox	No, I know the couch isn't very deep, but we can move the back cushion... and spoon.
606	Dr. Cox	Hey, guys, whatta ya say. Beer and chips in the back.
607	Dr. Cox	Just ignore them. Will you tell me the answer to this question: Do you want to be the big spoon, or the little spoon?
608	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
609	Turk	I'm telling ya, Kelso didn't even ask, and she gave you full credit.
610	Carla	I don't care. Too little, too late. Plus, I know why you're really here. So, I'm gonna park myself right here in the "V.I.P section," so you can give me what'cha got.
611	Turk	I was gonna tell you how I busted J.D.'s chops the other day for wanting to be friends with a girl. And now I find it so amazing to see how strong you are, how well you carry yourself, how I'd give anything just to wake up in the morning and watch you read the paper. But instead, I think you should hop off your broom for a second, try and remember what it was like when you first started here, and give Elliot a break. Because she may be a chore, but she is a good person. Your ass is especially fine today.
612	Carla	Pick me up tomorrow at seven.
613	Turk	She's not the only one that can do a speech. I can do a speech.
614	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
615	Dr. Cox	You are to return that umbrella to me at the hospital, not here, is that clear?
616	Dr. Cox	Hey, newbie. You know what your problem is?
617	J.D.	My bones hurt?
618	Dr. Cox	You were gonna, what, rescue me from loneliness with a three-dollar six-pack of light beer? It turns out, you can't save people from themselves, newbie. We just treat 'em. You treat that kid with a respiratory problem, and when he comes back with cancer, go ahead and treat that, too.
619	J.D.	Well, thanks for the pick-me-up!
620	Dr. Cox	Hey! Smokers, drinkers, druggies, fatties, whatever. All I'm saying is that if you keep living and dying on whether or not a person changes, well... you're not gonna make it as a doctor, that's all. Now... come here and gimme a hug.
621	Dr. Cox	It's okay. Come here...Come here.
622	Dr. Cox	Aw, get outta here! And take this piss-water with you. It's embarrassing to have it here.
623	Cox's Buddy	I'll drink it!
624	Dr. Cox	Eh! I'll take the beer. You beat it.
625	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
626	Turk	Go apologize.
627	Carla	No, I don't wanna.
628	Turk	Okay, come on, come on, come on. Just do it really fast, like a Band-Aid.
629	Carla	Here, I wrote out the pharmacy renewals on all your patients.
630	Elliot	Wow. Great! Hey, you know what else would be really helpful...
631	J.D.'s Narration	I think the one thing we never stop looking for is acceptance.
632	Elliot	Thank you, Carla.
633	Carla	You're welcome.
634	J.D.'s Narration	Acceptance of our own shortcomings...
635	Elliot	So, when's the baby due?
636	Female Patient	What baby?
637	J.D.'s Narration	...Acceptance that some things are gonna be what they're gonna be.
638	Will	This is a strange resort, man. I mean, this wheelchair service is great, but that suite I rented... there's another person in it. And for some reason, the bellhop gave me an enema.
639	J.D.	Yeah... he's new here.
640	Will	So... anything you wanna say?
641	J.D.	You know it all, man.
642	J.D.'s Narration	Still, I hated Will a little....
643	J.D.'s Narration	...'Cause, thanks to him, I started to look at all the people who were important to me in terms of what will probably kill them.
644	J.D.'s Narration	Heart Disease...
645	J.D.'s Narration	Liver disease...
646	J.D.'s Narration	Somebody choking her...
647	J.D.'s Narration	I dunno... Probably stress.
648	Dr. Cox	Say anything else to him?
649	J.D.	Nope.
650	Dr. Cox	But you wanted to.
651	J.D.	Yeah, but you told me not
652	Dr. Cox	Geez, J.D., would you be a man? Lookit, if you can't stick to your convictions, you'll never make it as a doctor.
653	Dr. Cox	I can't believe your head exploded. If your head explodes, you'll never make it as a doctor. I mean, come on, you look ridiculous.

656	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
657	J.D.'s Thoughts	I don't know why I came to watch Turk in surgery when I could've caught a few minutes of sleep. I guess I just haven't seen much of my best friend, lately. Still, it's not like I'm desperate or anything.
658	Dr. Wen	Look, I've been attending here for three years. What makes you think you know better?
659	Turk	In my gut, I know I'm right.
660	Dr. Wen	We need to make this decision now!
661	Turk	Fine, then, it's on you.
662	Dr. Wen	Yes, it is! Nurse Erasure!
663	Nurse	Yes, doctor.
664	Mr. Bidwell	I hate this song!
665	Turk	Me too, man. Me too.
666	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
667	Reopen	The Hospital, night-time a private patient's room.
668	J.D.'s Narration	It's weird, but a hospital room can actually be a romantic place. Maybe it's the soft green glow of a heart monitor, or the way the moonlight reflects off a bedpan....
669	Elliot	Our shifts keep overlapping on Friday nights.
670	J.D.	It's the closest thing I've had to a date, recently.
671	Elliot	Well, I had a great time tonight.
672	J.D.	Oh, yeah, me too. So... can I page you?
673	Elliot	You better. And don't do the whole two-day waiting thing.
674	J.D.	Oh, baby, I don't play by the rules.
675	Elliot	Well, uh, goodnight....
676	J.D.'s Thoughts	Wait a second, is she joking? 'Cause if she's joking and I kiss her...
677	1	Elliot hauls off and slaps J.D. hard.
678	2	At the front doors of the hospital, Dr. Kelso shoves J.D. a suitcase in each hand out with a swift kick in the rear.
679	End of Fantasy Sequence	J.D. looks at Elliot, perplexed
680	J.D.'s Thoughts	Of course, if she's not joking...
681	1	In wedding garb, Elliot and J.D. stand together, grinning. Elliot shows off her gigantic ring to the camera before giving J.D. an exuberant kiss.
682	2	J.D. and Elliot lie in bed, sweaty and panting.
683	3	Elliot and a brunette kiss. They part and the camera pulls back to reveal them in bed, just as J.D. sits up between them, looking like he's won the lottery.
684	Elliot	Come on, I don't do this for all the doctors.
685	J.D.'s Thoughts	Yes!
686	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
687	Dr. Cox	Look, this guy's gonna need 40 MAQ's of KCL; and go ahead and grab me when you get the results.
688	J.D.	You got it.
689	Dr. Cox	Oh, and his TV is broken, so, when you two do start tagging each other , least you can do is wake him up and let him watch.
690	J.D.'s Narration	In my experience, when two friends miss an opportunity like this, you've got exactly forty-eight hours to get the kiss.
691	J.D.'s Narration	...Otherwise, one of you is gonna over-think it okay, she's gonna over-think it and then you end up permanently stuck in "The Friend Zone."
692	Elliot	I'll see ya.
693	Patient	You're such a girl.
694	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
695	J.D.	So, nothing was going on last night between me and Elliot.
696	Dr. Cox	Good thing you still have your 'flower', then.
697	Turk	That song... is like a virus!
698	J.D.	I'm just a little lonely, you know; I guess 'cause I haven't really been hanging out with Turk since he's been dating Carla.
699	Dr. Cox	First of all, who's Turk? And don't answer. Look, if you have a medical question for me, I'm forced by hospital policy to answer you. However, if you ask me about a personal problem, I'm going to start doing this:
700	Janitor	You seem unhappy.
701	Janitor	I like that.
702	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
703	Turk	"I try to discover... a little something to make me sweeter. Oh, baby refrain " I cannot get that stupid song out of my head. It's like a damn virus. Okay, here's his chart , his transfer note; he's hemodynamically stable. Consider him officially turfed to Medicine.
704	Todd	T-Man, I'm gonna get my grub on.
705	Turk	Means he's gonna go eat.
706	J.D.	Ahhh. So, surgery went okay?
707	Turk	Yeah, it was cool; it was cool.
708	Turk	Dude, I got to close for the first time, ever. Ever! The human body is so disgusting!
709	Turk	Oh, not yours. Yours is stunning!
710	J.D.	We should go out and celebrate, you know, tear it up like we used to do; just the two of us.
711	Turk	And that would come before Part B...
712	J.D.	That's what... we used to tear it up...
713	J.D.	We should probably never do that again.
714	As the scene changes, we see miscellaneous hospital staff in a hall way, and a voice over of Turk's words echoing	"The song is like a virus." In a lavatory, the janitor is working to plunge a stopped up toilet, and is mumbling the words of the Erasure song.
715	Janitor	"Oh, baby, please.... Give a little respect.... To me."
716	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
717	The LED clock flashes onto the screen once again, still counting down from the time left, which now stands at 37	2:40
718	J.D.'s Thoughts	Don't let it be awkward. Do something cute; cover her eyes and say, "Guess who!"
719	J.D.	Guess who!
720	Elliot	I can't breathe.
721	Dr. Kelso	Okay, gang, it's time for rounds.
722	Dr. Kelso	Let's see who's 'The Weakest Link'!
723	Dr. Kelso	"The weakest link".... Now then, uh, Dr.... Simotas; the severe swelling of the lips exhibited by this patient might be an indication of what?
724	Dr. Simodes	Angio-edema.
725	Dr. Kelso	Well done... sport. And what treatment would you recommend, uh, Dr... uh, Dorian.
726	J.D.	A combination of steroids and any of several anti-histamines.
727	Dr. Kelso	Atta boy, sport.
728	Dr. Kelso	Now, then, what would you recommend the patient stay away from, uh, Dr... Reid?
729	Elliot	My first guess would be, uh, shellfish.
730	Dr. Kelso	Right you are, sweetheart.
731	Elliot	'Sweetheart'?
732	J.D.'s Narration	I could kinda see what was going on in Elliot's head.
733	Dr. Kelso	Right you are, sweetheart. Mmm...hmm...hmm.
734	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
735	Cut to interior	Living Room.
736	Turk	What do you wanna watch?
737	J.D.	"Fletch".
738	Turk	"Fletch" it is.
739	Carla	Seen it.
740	Turk	Well, you haven't seen it with us saying all the lines.
741	Carla	I'm so lucky I found you.
742	J.D.	Maybe next time, her mom could come.
743	Turk	Dude, you won't even know she's here. Well, except, she laughs at stupid stuff sometimes, and that kinda makes me laugh It's stup because it's so stupi
744	Turk	Oh, come on, tonight's still about us.
745	J.D.	Whatever, I don't care.
746	Carla	Turk? You wanna go hang out in your room?
747	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
748	Elliot	On the one hand, I know Dr. Kelso doesn't mean anything by it. And, okay, maybe I am kind of a sweetheart....
749	Dr. Cox	I'm sleeping.
750	Elliot	On the other hand, it just sounds so demeaning! You know?
751	Dr. Cox	Mother of God, you're not listening to a word I'm saying, are you.
752	Elliot	I mean, it's not like he's my grandpa or anything. Anyway J.D. always tells me how you've helped him out...
753	Dr. Cox	Well, he obviously hasn't told you about my ear-flicking policy, has he. Look! This whole "groovy guidance counselor" thing you people seem to have working is a total fantasy. I'm not that guy, you can go and ask anybody. Now, you've got to leave me alone, or I'll punish you.
754	Elliot	I guess "sweetheart" is kind of innocuous.
755	Dr. Cox	Okay! Here's what you're gonna do: Go right down there and confront Kelso.
756	Elliot	Really?
757	Dr. Cox	Oh, absolutely! Nevermind that he is the Chief of Medicine for the entire hospital; he'll have a whole new level of respect for you!
758	Elliot	Honestly?
759	Dr. Cox	Yes! You can't have sexist terms like that floating around here. You go get him.
760	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
761	J.D.	Okay, this guy looks stable, but I still wanna get an EKG; let's do Cardiac enzymes, and uh....
762	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
763	The LED clock flashes in the bottom of the screen, now reading 16	1:24
764	J.D.	Uhh... And an aspirin.
765	J.D.'s Narration	A lot of my work has become second nature to me.
766	Turk	Look, man, I'm surgery, and you're Medicine. This isn't college anymore; things have to change.
767	J.D.	Well, I know relationships change, I just thought yours and mine never would.
768	Turk	What's goin' on with you, man?
769	J.D.	Well, we always look out for each other.... I guess I just don't feel like you have my back anymore.
770	Turk	You really feel that way?
771	J.D.	Yeah, I do.
772	J.D.	Sure
773	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
774	Lawyer	Legally, there's a huge difference. When you stitch a patient, wind up sewing a sheet to him, that's an accident. When he tries getting up, the whole gurney collapses, breaking his front teeth, that's a lawsuit. Say it with me: Accident. Lawsuit.
775	Group	Accident. Lawsuit.
776	Dr. Kelso	So, what is it, sweetheart?
777	Elliot	It's that, it's the sweetheart thing. It just doesn't hit me right. I'm a doctor, and it seems sort of... disrespectful.
778	Dr. Kelso	Oh? I've always called the young men "sport" and the young women "sweetheart".
779	Elliot	But, you called Becky "sport".
780	Dr. Kelso	Oh... Well, I am so sorry.... Sport.
781	Dr. Kelso	It must be one of those bad habits I've developed after working in the medical field for over thirty years.
782	Elliot	Th-thirty years? But... you look so young!
783	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
784	J.D.'s Narration	It's never easy to see a patient that's getting worse instead of better. In fact, that's kind of the opposite of what we're going for.
785	J.D.	I don't get it, he was fine last night. Now he's diaphoretic, he's in and out of consciousness. He might even be septic.
786	Nurse Roberts	Well, we won't know anything until the lab gets his blood-work back.
787	J.D.'s Thoughts	If he's septic, there's a chance they'll have to reopen this guy. 'Course, there's also a chance he could die.
788	Nurse Roberts	I've seen this before. Gauze, sponges some young surgeon left something in this man.
789	J.D.	Noo. No. I know the guy that closed, he'd never be that careless.
790	Turk	'Kay, uh... Excuse me, sorry; has anyone seen my keys? No? Okay, how about my wallet? Anyone?
791	J.D.	I've never seen that before.
792	Nurse Roberts	"Oh, baby, please... give a little respect... to me."

798	J.D.	Oww! ...Oww!
799	J.D.	Turk?
800	The LED clock flashes onto the bottom of the screen, now counting down from 09	7:14
801	Elliot	Hey...I was just dreaming about you.
802	Elliot	...You were.... We were.... Hey; you got a few minutes?
803	J.D.	Don't move.
804	J.D.	No, no, no, no. Don't...move.
805	J.D.	Have you seen Turk?
806	Janitor	Yeah. I saw him. He just went out that door.
807	J.D.	Turk?
808	Janitor	La-la-la. Can't hear ya.

812	Elliot	Well, Mr. Kavanaugh, your arrhythmia is much better. Everything looks just great, actually.
813	Mr. Kavanaugh	You sound surprised.
814	Elliot	Well, okay, it has nothing to do with you; but I had a little run-in with Dr. Kelso yesterday, so, when he switched me over to you, I just thought it would be a difficult case.
815	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE

819	J.D.	Hey! Turk! I gotta talk
820	Turk	Hey! Come here!
821	J.D.	No, no, I gotta talk to you.
822	Turk	Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Look, it's 9-up. okay? We just lost our fourth, it's your ball.
823	J.D.	Look. it's very important that I talk to you, man.
824	Turk	This is not a joke, either! It's real, man; it's Surgical versus Medical. Your ball You're Shirts, come on.
825	Todd	Let's play, let's play.
826	J.D.'s Narration	And there it was, everything was more important than me now.
827	Becky	Don't bring in the same weak-ass crap the last kid did!
828	J.D.'s Narration	Suddenly, I was so fed up, I decided to teach Turk and Todd a lesson right there on the court....
829	J.D.'s Narration	...You know, once I warmed up a little.
830	Turk	J.D., I'ma show you what the deal's oh, oh, oh, ohh...
831	Turk	All right, that's game. What's so important?
832	J.D.	Okay, I was looking at Bidwell...
833	Turk	One second.
834	Turk	Damn! I gotta go. But you played a good game! You played a good game!
835	Todd	I thought you sucked.
836	J.D.	Go get your grub on.

840	Dr. Kelso	Yes?
841	Elliot	Sorry to bother you, sir.
842	Dr. Kelso	Well.... if it isn't "Sport."
843	Dr. Kelso	How are things? Did you... see Mr. Kavanaugh today?
844	Elliot	Yes...
845	Elliot	Yes.... I did. Dr. Kelso, I just wanted to say that, well, as far as the whole "sweetheart" thing goes, maybe I overreacted.
846	Dr. Kelso	Are you sure? Because I wouldn't want you to be the least bit uncomfortable.
847	Elliot	To tell you the truth, I have no idea what possessed me to say anything in the first place.
848	Dr. Cox	You've got to leave me alone, or I'll punish you.
849	Elliot	Yeah, absolutely no idea.
850	Dr. Kelso	Super. Then run along, sweetheart.
851	Dr. Kelso	"I try to discover.... a little something to make me sweeter...."
852	Cut to	The Nurses' Station
853	Carla	"....Oh, baby refrain from breaking my heart. I'm so in love with "
854	J.D.	Have you seen Mr. Bidwell's blood work?
855	Carla	Um... no, it hasn't come back yet.
856	J.D.	Okay.... Have you seen Turk?
857	Carla	Not since this morning.
858	J.D.	Well, I'm sure you'll end up seeing him before I do, so....
859	Carla	Bambi? Are you giving me attitude?
860	J.D.	What if I am?
861	Carla	Sweetie, you have to be a minority sidekick in a bad movie to pull that off. You know what I'm talking about, right?
862	Carla	Explain it to this man, please.
863	Carla	First, you do the head, then you do the finger, then you talk through the nose...
864	Carla	...And then you give a lot of attitude. That's how it works. But if you're not from there, you don't understand, so I'm not gonna even 'axe' you
865	J.D.	Okay, I'm gonna leave now.
866	Carla	What? Oh, no you didn't! Where' you going? Where' you going!?
867	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
868	Lawyer	Thank you very much.
869	Lawyer	What?
870	J.D.	Hi, how are ya? I have a quick legal question. What if, hypothetically
871	Lawyer	Oh, God, you killed somebody!
872	J.D.	Noooo!
873	Lawyer	Someone else did!
874	J.D.	No, no; no one killed anyone.
875	Lawyer	...Maimed, mutilated, disfigured.... Let's not split hairs.
876	J.D.	No, no, I'm not even sure there is a problem. I'm running tests, I'm doing everything that I should be doing.
877	Lawyer	Look, if you know about something, by not reporting it you're every bit as culpable. Now, is there anything that you'd like to tell me?
878	J.D.'s Thoughts	Why am I protecting Turk when he can't even give me five seconds of his time?
879	Lawyer	Anything at all?
880	J.D.'s Thoughts	Tell him.

886	Elliot	I feel stupid, but, sending me to Kelso like that well, I'm not sure, exactly, what you were trying to teach me.
887	Dr. Cox	The value and this is important of leaving me alone.
888	Elliot	I think we both know there was a little more to it than that.
889	Dr. Cox	No, no, no, there's not! Look...
890	Dr. Cox	I want you to spread the word, missy I've. Had. Enough. The next whiny intern that comes in here looking to me for a cookie and a hug, I swear to Aisha, I'm going to hurt them. And you, you neurotic, one-woman freak-show, take your "Blah-blah" to the blah-blah-ologist. Because if you are so stupid as to confront the Chief of Medicine over some quasi-offensive endearment, then you've just got to go ahead and replace the captain of your brainship, because he's drunk at the wheel.
891	Elliot	You're right. I need to learn to pick my battles! Thank you, sir.

894	J.D.	And you say your husband hardly wore them....

896	J.D.	Fantastic.
897	Nurse Roberts	Oh, and the blood-work came back.
898	J.D.	Negative? How could they be negative? The guy looks like death.
899	Mr. Bidwell	Hi!
900	J.D.	What happened?
901	Carla	There's no infection. He's diabetic; so when someone gave him insulin during post-op, when he wasn't eating, he became hypoglycemic.
902	J.D.	Oh, that's funny, because the only person who coulda given him insulin...
903	J.D.'s Thoughts	Uh-oh.
904	J.D.	Me!
905	J.D.	I gave him insulin!
906	J.D.'s Thoughts	Twice!
907	Carla	Well, he's fine, Bambi. I gave him an amp? of D-50 and he's eating, now. But you should probably give him a glass of orange juice in about an hour.
908	J.D.	Thank you so much. You totally saved my ass.
909	Carla	Well, it wasn't me....
910	J.D.	Look, Turk....
911	Turk	Come on, man; you know I always got your back.
912	J.D.	I know.
913	J.D.'s Thoughts	Just tell him how you feel without sounding like a girl, for once.
914	J.D.	I miss you so much it hurts, sometimes.
915	Turk	Okay, um, you've had a rough day, so I'm gonna let that go for now.
916	J.D.	Thank you.
917	Turk	Look, we're gonna find time to hang, man. It's just that we're both really swamped right now, and I'm hanging out with Carla a lot, I know... But tell me, if there was someone you were into, you wouldn't be doing the same thing.
918	J.D.	Oh, crap!
919	The LED clock is in the corner of the screen again, now reading a mere 00	1:00
920	Turk	Did Nurse Roberts sell you these?
921	Elliot	You don't even want to hear about the day I've had.
922	J.D.	You're right. Kiss me.
923	Elliot	What? Right now?
924	J.D.	Well, we can wait like, three, four seconds.
925	Elliot	No, I just ate, I feel gross.
926	J.D.	Not gross, pretty. Come here.
927	Elliot	J.D., can we just... talk for a second?
928	J.D.'s Thoughts	It never fails.
929	J.D. approaches the door, next to which is the sign	"FRIEND ZONE - S2-43" As he steps inside the room, he sees a small group of people standing around talking. Elevator-type muzak plays in the background.
930	Guy #1	Went to high school with her.
931	Guy #2	We worked at Penguin's Yogurt.
932	Guy #3	Met her on a bus.
933	Becky	She'll come around.
934	Guy #1	Pretzel?
935	J.D.	Thank you.
936	Elliot	The first few weeks here have been so hard for me, mentally, physically, emotionally. It's like math camp all over again. Not that I've ever been to math camp it's just an expression.
937	J.D.	I use it all the time.
938	J.D.	Come on.
939	J.D.'s Narration	I know the idea of choosing friendship over sex is the last thing any guy wants to hear. But you know what? This time, it actually made sense to me.
940	Cut to	Turk and J.D.'s Apartment.
941	J.D.'s Narration	...Besides, I challenge anyone to survive as an intern without a close group of friends to lean on.
942	J.D.	I cant believe you lost our bottle opener.
943	Turk	Yeah, I know.... I miss it so much, it hurts sometimes.

947	Elliot	You could just let it go?
948	Carla	No, I don't wanna let it go. It's a simple question why wouldn't I want to go to the symphony?
949	Elliot	No, I I I didn't mean anything by it.
950	Carla	Of course you meant something by it.
951	J.D.	We've got to do something about this.
952	Turk	No.... We really don't.
953	J.D.	Come on, Carla's your girlfriend, Elliot's my friend....
954	Turk	Dude, trust me, don't get involved.
955	Carla	So, if she's from el barrio, she must not like music.
956	Elliot	All I'm saying is that classical music isn't for everyone.
957	Carla	Ohh, so because I didn't grow up with a nanny changing my Vera Wang diap
958	Carla	You got something to say?
959	Turk	Mm-mm.
960	J.D.	Well, yes, frankly, I think that you're being condescending and you're being overly sensitive.
961	J.D.	'Scuse me for a second... just one second.
962	Carla	So if she grew up in the barrio, she must not like classical music.
963	Elliot	All I'm saying is that classical music isn't for everyone.

971	Cut to	interior. The Hallway Outside The Admissions Area.
972	J.D.'s Narration	Here's something that's kind of surprising: On my first day my resident told me, if you don't count the maternity ward which is mostly, well, you know or the emergency room which is mostly broken bones, stitches, you know, that sort of thing he said that, one out of every three patients that's admitted to this place...will die here.
973	Elliot	Hi, I'm gonna be your doctor.
974	J.D.	Hello? I'm the doctor!
975	J.D.	I'm...I'm...I'm the doctor.
976	Guy	What are you, sixteen?
977	Woman	Oh, this is unacceptable.
978	Guy	What'd you have, like, coupons to this hospital, ma?
979	Woman	I should we should have gone to my doctor.
980	Mrs. Tanner	Now that's enough! Now, sure, he's young, but he's probably a very good doctor. Are you a good doctor?
981	J.D.	It's kinda too soon to tell.
982	Mrs. Tanner	Honesty.... Well, I like that. You probably want these people to wait outside.
983	J.D.	That'd be nice.
984	Mrs. Tanner	Make 'em know you're a man, not a boy.
985	J.D.	Uhh... would you guys mind....
986	Woman	I'm fine where I am, thank you.
987	Guy	Make me.
988	Mrs. Tanner	Do it.
989	J.D.	Everybody outta here, now!
990	J.D.	"Now!"
991	Mrs. Tanner	Well, that was manly!
992	J.D.	Right... that's what I'm talkin' about.
993	Mrs. Tanner	Want a hard candy?
994	J.D.	Yes, please!
995	Cut to	Another Private Patient's Room
996	Turk	I'd say this is a simple laparoscopic hernia repair, sir.
997	Dr. Wen	Mm.
998	David	Oh, see, this is embarrassing you guys are wearing the same outfit. Don't sweat it, I'm not wearing pants. Aw, come on, that was funny!
999	Dr. Wen	Great. Moving on.
1000	David	Where're you guys going? ESPN Classic's showing the '82 NFC championship it's The Catch! Can I have some nurses over?
1001	Cut to	Yet Another Private Patient's Room
1002	Elliot	I called down and requested a Spanish-speaking nurse.
1003	Elliot	So... no English, huh?
1004	Elliot	I'm a chunky monkey from funky town.
1005	Carla	I'm gonna have a little trouble translating that.
1006	Elliot	Oh good, it's you.

1008	J.D.	I admitted this really neat old lady today.
1009	Turk	"Neat"? Dude, the 1930s called and they want their lingo back.
1010	J.D.	No, we had, like, this connection, you know?
1011	Turk	No, I don't know. Please, let me get my sweat on.
1012	J.D.'s Narration	Surgeons generally don't like to get too close to patients. Maybe it makes it harder to cut someone open... maybe it's just too risky... I dunno.
1013	J.D.	I feel like you're missing out. Like, this Mrs. Tanner, she's got this...incredible energy and...and warmth.
1014	Turk	Dude, the League of Women Voters called and they want to know where to send your membership info.
1015	J.D.	You're using that "somebody called" joke a lot.
1016	Turk	I know, I can't help it. I got a hernia patient to take care of.
1017	J.D.	What's his name?
1018	Turk	Well, his name is Hernia Patient, but we've gotten close so I like to call him "Hernia".
1019	J.D.	He must feel so safe and taken care of.
1020	Turk	Shut up.
1021	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
1022	Elliot	I paged Dr. Cox and he should be here any second.
1023	Elliot	What'd she say?
1024	Carla	Oh, she said she thinks it's amazing that your fancy private school didn't teach you any Spanish, considering that a third of your patients speak it as a primary language.
1025	Elliot	Oh, yeah, like every doctor here speaks Spanish.
1026	Dr. Cox	Hola, Señora Guerrero! Como se siente hoy?
1027	Mrs. Guerrero	...no muy bien.
1028	Dr. Cox	Ah, bueno. What now, Dr. Barbie?
1029	Elliot	Mrs. Guerrero's a forty-year-old Lupus patient who presented with shortness of breath; so I started her on a Heparin drip and ordered a VQ scan. I just wanted to run that by you
1030	Dr. Cox	One, two, three
1031	Elliot	So should I continue with the Hep
1032	Dr. Cox	It's really important that you let me get to ten.
1033	Elliot	Well, I just thought
1034	Dr. Cox	Listen, cookie, you've been here over a month. This is Medicine 101: I don't want every little thing run by me; I don't wanna give you my two cents' worth. But if you ever do wanna know my opinion, rest assured it will always be that you're an incredible pain and that every time I see your kew-pie-doll face, it just makes me wanna pick you up and shake you until all the hours of my life that you've wasted...fall out. Now laugh.
1035	Elliot	What?
1036	Dr. Cox	Laugh so that she doesn't think I'm yelling at you.
1037	Carla	Ohh!... How fun was that!

1039	J.D.	Dr. Kelso.... Hi. I wanted to get your opinion about a patient.
1040	J.D.	She's uh... a seventy-four-year-old renal failure, Mrs. Tanner.
1041	Dr. Kelso	Oh, of course! One of our frequent fliers she's a neat lady.
1042	J.D.	That's what I said!
1043	Dr. Kelso	Nobody likes a brown-nose, son. Let me see the chart.
1044	He takes it from J.D. and begins reading. J.D. stands waiting, his eyes locked on the Janitor, who begins mouthing something at him. J.D. puts his hand to his ear and mouths back "What?" So, the Janitor repeats, this time with hand motions	he points to himself "I'm" then he makes a walking motion "going" he holds up two fingers "to" he wrings an imaginary neck "kill" and he points at J.D. "you."
1045	J.D.	Why?
1046	Dr. Kelso	We'll put her on diuretics.
1047	J.D.	Yeah... I ordered them.
1048	Dr. Kelso	These labs don't look good; I think it's time she got started on dialysis.
1049	Dr. Kelso	Oh, but you know what you should do first, kiddo?
1050	J.D.	What's that?
1051	Dr. Kelso	Find her.

1060	David	Hey, come on, man; it's the fourth quarter, you got a minute?
1061	Turk	...Sure.
1062	David	Cool.
1063	Turk	David, right?
1064	David	Yeah.
1065	Turk	I'm Turk.
1066	David	What's up. You want some IV?
1067	Turk	No, I'm good.

1071	J.D.	Mrs. Tanner....
1072	Guy	Oh, here's the party.
1073	J.D.	Look, I don't know how it's been with your other doctors, but when you're under my care, you stay in the hospital until I say it's okay for you to leave.
1074	Mrs. Tanner	We saved you a plate.
1075	J.D.	I don't care about food right now!
1076	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, my God, are those s'mores?
1077	Mrs. Tanner	Look, it's Samantha's fifth birthday. Now you're not gonna make me miss this, are you?
1078	J.D.	Couldn't you have got her a big cake?
1079	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
1080	Elliot	I'm gonna order an ABG just to be safe.... Don't you think?
1081	Carla	Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
1082	Elliot	Hey, teach me to tell her she's doing fine.
1083	Carla	Um... okay. Say, um, "Esta...progresando...muy bien."
1084	Elliot	Mrs. Guerrero? Um... esta...progresando...m-muy bien.
1085	Mrs. Guerrero	Ah! Gracias.
1086	Elliot	Ooh! It worked!
1087	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
1088	Turk	All right, listen, the important thing to remember is this is not gonna hurt as much as you think.
1089	David	I'm ready.

1091	J.D.	Okay, you know what, Mrs. Tanner....
1092	Mrs. Tanner	Just until Samantha blows out her candles. What are you gonna wish for, honey? Uhhhhm.... a bike?
1093	Samantha	Nope.
1094	Mrs. Tanner	A doll house?
1095	Samantha	Nope.
1096	J.D.	How about the ability to make quick decisions?
1097	Samantha	Umm... Nope.
1098	J.D.	How 'bout this?
1099	Mrs. Tanner	Uh, a pony!
1100	Samantha	No!
1101	J.D.	Okay, enough of this. I don't think any of you realize how serious this is. Right now we need to be worried about your mother, your grandmother... your....
1102	J.D.	I'm sorry, we we haven't met, I'm Dr. Dorian.
1103	Mrs. Tanner	You're very cute.
1104	J.D.	Thank you. Come on, let's go.

1109	Elliot	I increased the Heparin to 1500 units per hour. Does...that sound like enough?
1110	Carla	Should be.
1111	Elliot	Speaking of Heparin, have you slept with Turk yet?
1112	Carla	What!?
1113	Elliot	I'm sorry, I'm no, I'm sorry... too personal.
1114	Carla	I like to wait. I like a guy to want it so bad he basically thinks he isn't gonna get it ever.
1115	Carla	Then when he's lost the will to live, that's when I jump him.
1116	Elliot	So, how long does that usually
1117	Carla	A month, maybe two. What about you?
1118	Elliot	I like to use sex as an ice-breaker.
1119	Carla	Ah. And how's that working out for you?
1120	Elliot	I guess I don't have what you would call high self-esteem.

1122	Dr. Wen	Let me know when you find the hernia.
1123	Turk	You got it.

1126	Girl	Go left, here.
1127	Turk	It's a right.
1128	Girl	You passed his Cooper's ligament three times already. Just stop and ask for directions!
1129	Turk	Do you want to drive this thing? 'Cause I will pull I will pull this thing over and let you drive this thing!
1130	Dr. Wen	Wait a second. Go back to where you just were.

1135	Elliot	Shoot.
1136	Cut to	Mrs. Tanner's Room.
1137	J.D.	So, that's basically it. Your kidneys aren't responding to the medication anymore. I'm afraid we're gonna have to start you on dialysis.
1138	Mrs. Tanner	Oh, I'm not a big fan of dialysis.
1139	J.D.	Yeah, unfortunately we don't really have a choice.
1140	Mrs. Tanner	Well, actually, I do have a choice.
1141	J.D.'s Narration	Certain things you never expect to come out of a person's mouth.
1142	Mrs. Tanner	I think I'm ready to die.

1147	Mrs. Tanner	You're gonna have to shut your mouth at some point.
1148	Mrs. Tanner	Sweetie, I'm seventy-four years old, I'm ready to go.
1149	J.D.	Yeah, but with dialysis, you could live another...eighty or ninety years.
1150	Mrs. Tanner	I think you're being a little irrational.
1151	J.D.	No I'm not.
1152	Mrs. Tanner	Everybody dies sometime.
1153	J.D.	No they don't.
1154	Cut to	The Nurses' Station.
1155	Turk	Actually, sir, I think we're really lucky we found the lymphoma when we did. ... ... 'Course. ... No, yeah, I'll wait for you to get here before I tell David anything. ... ... Okay, see you soon.
1156	Dr. Kelso	Gosh, sport, I sure hope you're not using that phone to make a personal call.
1157	Turk	No, actually, sir, that was David Morrison's father. He's a patient of mine. Dave's a good kid.
1158	Dr. Kelso	Well, he sounds terrific; you two are becoming best pals, huh? Well, you know what we should do? The three of us should play ourselves a game of stickball.
1159	Turk	Sir?
1160	Dr. Kelso	Sure, all we need is a stick and a ball and a pocketful of dreams. Or, we could take turns bowling your patient down the hallways of my hospital.
1161	Turk	Okay, listen, sir, I can explain. That's
1162	Dr. Kelso	Spare me.
1163	Turk	Spare you! That's good, sir... 'cause of the bowling thing. That's You're not making a joke are you.
1164	Dr. Kelso	Not at the moment.
1165	Turk	I just think he's a good kid, and I really thought he needed a friend.
1166	Dr. Kelso	Young man, your patients don't need friends; they need a doctor.
1167	Cut to	Another Hallway.
1168	Elliot	Her BP's dropping; maybe it's time to push thrombolitics. If you were her doctor, what would you do?
1169	Carla	That's way out of my league, Elliot!
1170	Elliot	I don't know about waiting; I mean, she seems to be decompensating. But, thrombolitics scare me. I mean, a lot of times, the patient bleeds out.
1171	Carla	She needs to know what's going on.
1172	Elliot	Uh... I'll be right back.
1173	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
1174	Dr. Cox	So, she doesn't want dialysis?
1175	J.D.	Yeah, what does that mean, I mean
1176	Dr. Cox	Well, if she doesn't want dialysis, then there is no ethical dilemma.
1177	J.D.	But what about our duty as doctors to do everything in our power to help pe
1178	Dr. Cox	'What about our duty as doctors?' Look. This has nothing to do with the patient it's all about you. You are afraid of death, and you can't be. You're in medicine, you gotta accept the fact that everything we do here everything is a stall. We're just trying to keep the game going; that's it. But, ultimately, it always ends up the same way.
1179	Grim Reaper	I win.
1180	J.D.	Where, I don't see?

1186	Turk	Yeah, but he's got a point, this is a hospital it's not a playground.
1187	Turk	Well, if it's not the medulla oblongata. That's about fifty points, there, wouldn't you say? I won? I'll just take your fruit cup and be on my way.
1188	David	I talked to my dad, today.
1189	David	He's coming out.
1190	Turk	Cool.
1191	David	And that, uh, that nurse came by to shave me again.
1192	Turk	Hey, I didn't tell her to do that.
1193	David	You didn't?
1194	Turk	No; I think she's got a crush on you.

1196	Turk	Okay... Uh, here's the deal....
1197	Cut to	Mrs. Tanner's Room
1198	J.D.'s Thoughts	She's telling her family. There's nothing that could make me go in there right now.
1199	J.D.	You didn't tell them, did you.
1200	Mrs. Tanner	It didn't come up. Look, they don't need that burden; besides, they'd just give me a bunch of reasons to change my mind.
1201	J.D.	Speaking of which, I took the liberty of jotting down a few things I think everybody should do at least once in their life.
1202	Mrs. Tanner	Oh, no.
1203	J.D.	Okay. "Number One: Eat a sausage-and-pepper hoagie from Enrico's."
1204	Mrs. Tanner	Well, of course I've done that.
1205	J.D.	"Number Two: Go to Asia."
1206	Mrs. Tanner	Gonenn kan kurai Kyoto ni sunnde imashita.
1207	J.D.	I'm gonna take that as a yes, and I'll also check off "Learn a foreign language".
1208	Mrs. Tanner	Mm-hmm.
1209	Cut to	The Darkened Doctor's Lounge.
1210	Carla	What the hell happened to "I'll be right back"? I can't believe I actually started to think I've been wrong about you. That woman needs her doctor to tell her something, anything, and you run away? Are you even gonna look at me?
1211	Elliot	Oh, I've been trying to decide what drink to get. I've been standing here trying to choose between cherry soda and, uh, ginger ale. And you know what? It's a toss-up. I mean, either way I get a cold drink, right? And it would be almost impossible for me to kill someone with this decision, but... I still can't make it. I think I'm in trouble here.
1212	Carla	Look, I don't think these kinds of decisions are easy for anyone. And if it's any consolation, one of the reasons I never liked you is because you're already better at this than most of the doctors that come through here; and to be honest, I kinda liked being the only smart, strong chick in the joint.
1213	Elliot	You sort of just complimented me.
1214	Carla	Little bit.
1215	Elliot	Okay, I'm gonna have a ginger ale.
1216	Carla	Good start.
1217	Elliot	And...that clot isn't going anywhere on its own; so, let's push the thrombolitics.

1224	Mrs. Tanner	Oh, now you're making stuff up.
1225	J.D.	No, I'm not; it's right here, you can look at it!
1226	Mrs. Tanner	Listen, Dr. Dorian, there's not one thing I regret as I lay here right now. I'm ready. I really am.
1227	J.D.	You have had an amazing life.
1228	Mrs. Tanner	Good, then we agree. Now, aren't there other patients you need to be seeing?
1229	J.D.	Me? No, no, I've I've been off for two hours.
1230	Mrs. Tanner	So, with your precious free time, you've been sitting in a hospital room talking to an old lady. What about your list? How many of those things have you done? For that matter, how many times have you sat in the grass and done nothing, hm?
1231	Mrs. Tanner	You need to start taking some time for yourself, young man. Promise me you'll do that.
1232	J.D.	I will.
1233	Mrs. Tanner	Good. Now, get outta here. Go on.
1234	J.D.	Yeah, well, let me I just want to check out a few things before I...get going.
1235	J.D.	Uh-huh.... Uhh-huh....
1236	Mrs. Tanner	Are you okay?
1237	J.D.	I'm scared.

1260	Elliot	How ya feeling, Jared?
1261	Jared	Okay, I guess.
1262	Elliot	Oh, hey! I heard your dad arranged a visit from The Rock?
1263	Jared	Oh, yeah, I'm thirteen, I must love wrestling, right? Woo-hoo.

1265	Louie Anderson	Okay, Guys, we need an answer.
1266	Louie Anderson	Name one thing guys wanna see more than anything in the whole, wide world.

1296	Turk	I swear, when you're not here, he does it.
1297	Carla	Oh, I'm sure he's just shy.
1298	J.D.	I think you should go ahead and do it.
1299	Elliot	I am not flashing my breasts!
1300	J.D.	Why not? It's easy, you just go like this.
1301	Elliot	Ooh, that's hot.
1302	J.D.	Oh, , I went by Pediatrics..... They thought it was funny.
1303	Carla	I'm borrowing a sweatshirt.
1304	Carla	'Scuse me, what did we agree you would do whenever I left a room?
1305	Turk	Oh, I'm sorry, baby.
1306	Carla	That's better.
1307	Turk	How was that?
1308	J.D.	Ahhhhhh! My man, Turk, is getting it daily, nightly, and ever so rightly!
1309	J.D.	Ah! What up, dude!
1310	J.D.'s Thoughts	Once every 4.2 seconds a man says something stupid that a woman hears and punishes him for....
1311	J.D.'s Thoughts	Luckily, this wasn't one of those times.
1312	Carla	What did you just say?
1313	J.D.	"What up...dude?"
1314	Carla	Why would you think that Turk and I slept together? Because I'm a nurse? Because I'm Latina?
1315	J.D.	No, just 'cause you guys have been dating...for a while. Do Latina women put out more? Because that's not something I've I've ever heard.
1316	J.D.	Turk told me.
1317	Turk	No! I didn't! No, I swear. Look, he he assumed.
1318	Carla	Uh-huh. And did you correct him?
1319	Turk	Well, you know, I've been really busy at the hospital lately....
1320	Carla	Is that how you see this relationship, as some mad dash to the finish line? Because I'll take you into that bedroom right now; and I promise you, you will be walking sideways for the rest of your life, because I will have used all your up-and-down. Now, is that what you want?
1321	Turk	No.
1322	Carla	Good. Because what I want is for this to be a real relationship. I want us to know each other better than we know ourselves.
1323	Turk	Wow.
1324	Carla	That's right "wow."
1325	Carla	So if you really want me 'daily and nightly and ever so rightly'...
1326	Elliot	That sounds like something you'd say.
1327	Carla	...Show me that you know me.
1328	J.D.	So, anyway, I think you should let the kid meet the ladies.

1330	Dr. Cox	So, you're the one who told Kelso that Mr. Martinez was dead? That's terrific work.
1331	J.D.'s Thoughts	Looks like word gets around.
1332	Dr. Cox	What in the name of 'Are ya there, God, it's me Margaret' were you thinking.
1333	J.D.	Well, I'm new here, but I'm relatively certain that invasive vascular procedures have a very low success rate on dead people.
1334	Dr. Cox	That TIPS procedure was for Mrs. Blitt down in 103. You see, she doesn't have insurance; Mr. Martinez, on the other hand, had great insurance. Should I talk slower or go get a nurse who speaks fluent moron?
1335	J.D.	You don't have to be, like, mean about it.
1336	Dr. Cox	Well, geez, newbie, just what in the hell do you want from me, huh?
1337	Dr. Cox	I don't know if they taught you this in the land of fairies and puppy-dog tails, where you obviously, if not grew up then at least spent most of your summers, but you're in the real world now. Nnnnn-kay?
1338	J.D.'s Thoughts	Don't say it!
1339	J.D.	I still think I was right.
1340	J.D.'s Thoughts	Once every 6.3 seconds, a man says something stupid that another man hears and punishes him for...
1341	J.D.'s Thoughts	Luckily, this wasn't
1342	Dr. Cox	That's it!
1343	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, no.
1344	Dr. Cox	Do you know what this is? This is me washing my hands of you. I will not be in the same room with you again, starting....
1345	Dr. Cox	....Now.
1346	Janitor	Tissue?
1347	Cut To	Jared's Room
1348	Cut to	The Hallway of the Unit

1352	Dr. Kelso	Hey, sport. Or should I say, howdy, Mr. Pouty.
1353	J.D.	Sorry, sir, it's been a rough day.
1354	Dr. Kelso	So I hear. Well, anyway, I'm very proud of you, Dr... uhmmmmmm......
1355	J.D.'s Thoughts	Just look at my badge!
1356	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Turk!
1357	J.D.	Oh, no, this this is my roommate's badge, sir; we must have switched this morning. We were b
1358	Dr. Kelso	Oh, that's a great anecdote. You should write that down in your journal, then your kids can read about it when you're dead.
1359	Dr. Steadman	Sir, they're waiting for us
1360	Dr. Kelso	In a moment. If you will promise to go easy on the stories, I'd love for you to join me for a round of golf tomorrow.
1361	J.D.	That'd be terrific, sir!
1362	Dr. Kelso	Super.
1363	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
1364	Turk	You wanna show a woman you know her, you gotta buy her a little somethin'-somethin'.
1365	Elliot	This doesn't make any sense, none of my patients are improving.
1366	Turk	I'm gonna buy her flowers.
1367	Todd	Yeah!!!!
1368	Elliot	Please, it's been done to death.
1369	Elliot	I don't get it; I've done everything by the book.
1370	J.D.	Well, maybe that's the problem, maybe you're just approaching things too clinically.
1371	Turk	How 'bout chocolates?
1372	Elliot	Mmm! With rich, cliché centers?
1373	J.D.	Have you ever tried treating your patients with something other than traditional medicine?
1374	Turk	I got it! I'm gonna buy her a really nice...pen.
1375	Turk	No...she loves to write. She hand-writes all of her letters because she says e-mail is too impersonal. That's perfect!
1376	Elliot	Pen is good.
1377	Todd	Yeah-ah!
1378	Turk	Now all I gotta do is find time to get outta here and maybe I'll buy her one.
1379	J.D.	Look, all I'm saying is, there's more to healing than what's in the books. I talk to my patients, I I sing to them...
1380	J.D.	...Ask them what their hobbies are; and tell them ghost stories about an old sea captain.
1381	Nurse Roberts	Thought you'd be interested in that kid Jared's chart.
1382	Elliot	Wow! Look at that white blood cell count!
1383	J.D.	Look at that. And all it took was a visit from The Rock.
1384	Todd	The Rock was here and nobody told me?!
1385	Elliot	The Rock couldn't make it.
1386	Nurse Roberts	Well, somebody did something.
1387	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
1388	J.D.'s Narration	It felt weird knowing that Dr. Cox and I would never be working in the same room again.
1389	Dr. Cox	Check her LFTs and a coax for me.
1390	Carla	Yeah, sure.
1391	J.D.'s Thoughts	Every time I think something, the opposite happens.... I am so not having sex this weekend.
1392	Mrs. Blitt	You're cute.
1393	Dr. Cox	Who's the present from?
1394	Carla	Oh, my boyfriend.
1395	Dr. Cox	Really, when did he give it to you?
1396	J.D.'s Thoughts	Look at him, pretending like yesterday never happened. Well, if he thinks I'm gonna forgive him without so much as a
1397	Dr. Cox	Anyway, newbie, the reason I was all bent outta shape yesterday
1398	J.D.	I accept!
1399	Dr. Cox	Don't interrupt me. Come here;
1400	Dr. Cox	Pull that curtain. Mrs. Blitt over there needs the TIPS procedure, no insurance? Yeah, well, she can now look forward to a lifetime of encephalopathy and jaundice thanks to Bottom-Line Bob.
1401	J.D.	Is it really that bad?
1402	Dr. Cox	I...hate...Robert Kelso. I hate his family, I hate his friends, I hate the guy that cleans his vaguely racist little lawn jockey; in fact, I hate anybody who ever even associates with him. Is that clear?
1403	J.D.	Totally.

1409	Guy 1	I fell on it.
1410	Cut To	A woman, sitting in front of hers ...
1411	Woman	I fell on it?
1412	Cut To	Another guy ...
1413	Guy 2	I fell on it.
1414	Cut To	Yet another guy, who looks rather nonchalant ...
1415	Dude	I was bored.
1416	Nurse Roberts	The doctors in the ER have a box where they actually keep all this junk.
1417	Turk	Is that, like, next to the lost-&-found box?
1418	Nurse Roberts	Lost-&-found box? There's no lost-&-found box. There's an ass box.
1419	Elliot	Oh, no, that's not Carla's pen?

1424	Dr. Steadman	Yes, sir, Dr. Kelso!

1426	Dr. Kelso	Steadman... I need a tee.
1427	Dr. Steadman	A tee or some tea, sir? because I brought both.
1428	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, relax, it's just a friendly game of golf with a couple of guys from work.

1434	J.D.	Thought you hated Kelso.
1435	Dr. Cox	Oh, I do. And watching his face as I kick his worthless butt up and down this golf course every week is basically..., well, it's the most fun I can have without being forced to cuddle afterwards.
1436	Dr. Steadman	Oh, goodnight, Irene! Fantastic golf shot, sir!
1437	Dr. Cox	Real nice length. Now, does your husband happen to play?
1438	Dr. Kelso	Ha...ha.
1439	Dr. Cox	For the record, no, I'm not a hypocrite for being here. What's your pathetic excuse, you whiny, little suck-up.
1440	J.D.'s Thoughts	Ignore him. Just let your game do all the talking.

1458	J.D.	It's just a technicality.
1459	Dr. Kelso	Ah. But there's the rub. The rules are there for a reason; you break one, why not break them all?
1460	Cut To	Another Hole
1461	Dr. Cox	You know that before medicine ever became a business, the only rule was to do your best to help the patient.
1462	Cut To	The Sandtrap
1463	Dr. Kelso	Like it or not, medicine is a business. If the hospital shuts down, who are we helping then?

1472	Cut To	The Water
1473	Dr. Cox	It's about what's best for the patient.
1474	Cut to	The 18th Green.
1475	Dr. Kelso	The only reason I go back to that hospital day after day is because I care about those patients every one of 'em. You've got a lot of potential, sport; you stick with me, and you're going to be climbing the ladder very quickly. Isn't that what you want?
1476	Dr. Kelso	You have to sink this for the win, Cox.
1477	Dr. Cox	Hey, newbie, c'mere I almost forgot. I'm gonna get Mrs. Blitt her TIPS procedure tomorrow, with or without insurance; and I want you to help me. Now, tell me, Margaret, do you have the stones to sink a putt when you have to?
1478	Dr. Cox	See you next Wednesday.
1479	Dr. Cox	I love this game!

1481	J.D.	I can't decide if I should help Cox or not. It's driving me crazy.
1482	Turk	Dude, at least you didn't give your girlfriend a gift that used to be inside of someone.
1483	J.D.	That's true.
1484	Elliot	I have magic breasts.
1485	J.D.	How many has she had?
1486	Turk	Almost one. You know what, Cox doesn't need your help taking her down for a TIPS procedure. As a matter of fact, he shouldn't even be putting you in that situation!
1487	J.D.	You're right.
1488	Turk	Hell, yeah, I'm right! Screw Cox! ....I mean, you're not afraid of him, are you?
1489	J.D.	Hell no!

1504	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
1505	Dr. Kelso	Let's just worry about getting you better, okay gorgeous?
1506	J.D.'s Narration	I'd decided that Cox was wrong. There's room to play by the rules and care about the patients.
1507	Dr. Kelso	I want you to do a wallet biopsy on her, and if the insurance doesn't check out, I want her back to the nursing home before she so much as gums down a single fruit cup.
1508	Dr. Steadman	Mm-hmm.
1509	J.D.'s Narration	Unfortunately, that was the moment I realized how Dr. Kelso truly saw these people.
1510	Dr. Kelso	Can I have a price-check on a seventy-four-year-old female with pre-renal azotemia?
1511	Dr. Kelso	Bag her!

1515	Turk	So...I thought a really nice one would be a great gift; and I see a great one...in the "lost-&-found" box.
1516	Carla	There is no "lost-&-found" box. There's an ass box.
1517	Turk	Yeah.... There is.
1518	Carla	Ugh.... And to think, you were this close to getting everything you wanted! I assume this is what you want.
1519	Turk	Yes.
1520	Carla	And yet you come home and tell me that your thoughtful token of love wasn't a token of love at all... it was an ass pen. You come home and tell me this all because being open and honest in our relationship is more important to you than....having sex with me.

1529	Old Man	Well, I'm afraid I have just an awful case of the 'gotta see 'ems.'
1530	J.D.	You know that's not even a real disease?
1531	Elliot	At what point did I become a crazy person?
1532	J.D.	Oh, come on. Yes, exposing yourself to a dead guy might have been a tad unorthodox; and yes, it might be a little hard to live down....
1533	Elliot	I'm waiting for the "but."
1534	J.D.	So is everyone else around here.
1535	J.D.	Oh, that's not funny.
1536	Elliot	Thanks. Glad I shared.
1537	J.D.	Come on. When I look at you, I look at a doctor who'll do whatever it takes to help a patient.
1538	Elliot	Really?
1539	J.D.	Yeah, really.
1540	J.D.'s Narration	And...on that note....
1541	Cut to	The Admissions Area
1542	J.D.	I just want you to know, if you still want my help, I'm on board.
1543	Dr. Cox	What, are you kidding? It's way too big of a risk for a peon. Okay I just wanted to see what team you were playing for.
1544	J.D.'s Thoughts	So it was all a test.
1545	Dr. Cox	Besides, I already did it.
1546	Dr. Kelso	Cox!!!!
1547	Dr. Cox	Run, junior daddy's home!
1548	Dr. Kelso	Did you actually think I wouldn't find out what you did!?
1549	Dr. Cox	What did I do?
1550	Dr. Kelso	You insolent....
1551	Dr. Cox	I'm insolent?
1552	Dr. Kelso	....Arrogant....
1553	Dr. Cox	I I'm arrogant?
1554	J.D.'s Narration	I know it sounds melodramatic, but in my mind, as I watched the two of them, they weren't battling for patients or insurance... they were battling for my soul.
1555	Dr. Cox	...Bottom line, she needs the TIPS procedure, with insurance or without insurance...
1556	Dr. Kelso	I've got you this time, Cox. I can taste it!
1557	J.D.'s Narration	It's an old story, really good versus bad, right versus wrong... the Dark Side versus The Light...
1558	Dr. Kelso	I've been waiting for this moment all my life.
1559	Turk	Easy, Chewy.
1560	Dr. Kelso	I'll teach you to respect this institution.
1561	Dr. Cox	I hope you learn from this.
1562	J.D.	NO!!!
1563	Dr. Kelso	You're suspended! Effective immediately.
1564	Dr. Kelso	Well, sport, it looks like a permanent spot just opened up on the golf course. How does joining the Chief of Medicine for a weekly round sound?
1565	J.D.	Actually, sir, I'm not really that in to golf.
1566	Dr. Kelso	Well, I guess that's your choice, isn't it... Dr. Dorian.
1567	J.D.'s Thoughts	I think I liked it better when he didn't know my name.
1568	Janitor	That's one for me.

1584	JD	Dr. Cox, if you need to talk
1585	J.D.'s Narration	It was weird knowing that my mentor could be fired by this time tomorrow. But there's no reason to feel any less confident; I'll be fine without a safety net.

1588	JD	Or stant.

1591	J.D.'s Narration	There's a lot of horrible things about being an intern: long hours, constant stress, having to deal with death. But worst of all is the simple fact that the average intern has to disimpact fifteen to twenty bowels a week.
1592	JD	That's why there's a sacred oath among interns never to make fun of each other for doing the things we have to do.
1593	Elliot	Hee-hee. You have to touch someone's hiney!
1594	Dr. Kelso	Dorian, come with me. And Dr... uh...

1596	Dr. Kelso	Sure, why not. Take over for him.
1597	JD	Hee-hee!
1598	Dr. Kelso	I'm assigning you to a very important board member whose family built this hospital with their bare hands.

1600	Dr. Kelso	But for hypertrophic cardio-myopathy.
1601	J.D.	What happened?
1602	Dr. Kelso	Pre-syncope.
1603	J.D.	So this board member almost fainted? I'll fire up the paddles.

1606	Dr. Kelso	You annoy me.

1621	Elliot	Oh, my God, I did it again! Dr. Greenberg. "Dr."? What kind of doctor are you? I keep doing it! Okay, okay, um... just just act it out.
1622	Elliot	Head?
1623	Elliot	Shrinking. Shrin You're a shrink!
1624	Elliot	Wow! I can't imagine picking psychiatry as a specialty after interning as a real doctor.
1625	Elliot	That didn't come out right... It's just, my dad um, he's a doctor, too he says therapy is for people with more money than problems.
1626	Elliot	But then... my dad says a lot of things....
1627	Nurse	Did anyone page a nurse?

1633	Carla	You should get dressed.
1634	Turk	I can't, it's still out there.
1635	Carla	Don't call my mother "it"; it implies you think that she's a monster! Now get a move on it usually gets up to feed about now.
1636	Turk	Baby, I don't understand why we couldn't stay at my place. I mean, I coulda done a whole show for you.
1637	Carla	Ohhh! There's a show.
1638	Turk	Yeah, there's a show. It involves music, some dancing, occasionally singing.
1639	Carla	Can you do "Me and Mrs. Jones"?
1640	Turk	I dunno.... What does she look like?
1641	Carla	Look, you wanted to spend the whole night together, and I can't leave my mother alone, she's frail.
1642	Turk	Baby, tell her to put the cane down.
1643	Carla	Mama!
1644	Carla's Mama	No!
1645	Turk	Tell her to put the cane down!
1646	Carla	She doesn't want me to have men here because I'm unmarried.
1647	Turk	Well tell her I needed a place to crash; she doesn't have to know we had sex all night.
1648	Carla	She speaks English!
1649	Turk	Then what the hell are you translating for?
1650	Carla	Because you don't speak Spanish!
1651	Turk	Oh! Hola!
1652	Carla's Mama	No! NO!

1656	J.D.	I have to be honest, Miss Sullivan; when Dr. Kelso said "board member", I was thinking of this, like, old, grumpy
1657	Jordan	That would be my father. He died.
1658	J.D.	I'm so sorry.
1659	Jordan	...Twenty years ago.
1660	J.D.	Oh. I woulda said sorry back then, but I had a little trouble with my S's.
1661	J.D.	...I was five.... S's.... So... uh... how are you feeling?
1662	Jordan	Great. That's why I'm here. Listen, R.J.
1663	J.D.	J.D.
1664	Jordan	Like it matters. Look, you seem like a nice, spineless little boy, so let's be honest. I'm here because it was the only way to end my beast of a mother's nagging, pseudo-concern.
1665	J.D.	How sweet.
1666	Jordan	So, do your little tests; but first, close the blinds, wash off whatever eighth-grade dance cologne you're wearing so we don't add nausea to my symptoms, and I'll need lemon wedges for my sparkling water which, for some reason, you have yet to get me.
1667	J.D.	Okay, well let me just check out
1668	Jordan	Doing things I want first, your little tests later.
1669	J.D.	Nice to meet you.

1672	Elliot	Merry Christmas, Dr. Greenberg!
1673	Elliot	I mean, uh, happy Halloween. Ugh! I am so frazzled; I did not sleep at all. In fact, I haven't really slept since I started here.
1674	Elliot	Just so much pressure, you know? I can't talk to anyone here 'cause it's so competitive. I used to be able to talk to my mom, but now, well... she listens but... she just never really seems to hear me, you know?
1675	It reads	"How does that make you feel?"
1676	Elliot	Lonely, depressed, overwhelmed. And sometimes I have no idea how I'm possibly gonna be able to make it through this.
1677	It reads	"PAIN PILL"
1678	Elliot	Oh, no. I don't even like to take aspirin; I'd rather just
1679	Elliot	Oh, you!

1681	Dr. Kelso	Ah, Dr. Cox, I've been thinking about your predicament, and I think I have a solution.
1682	Dr. Kelso	Cruise ships!
1683	Dr. Cox	Right.
1684	Dr. Kelso	Think about it, everyone will call you "Doc", you'll visit exotic ports, heck, maybe you'll even get to meet Charo!
1685	Dr. Cox	Listen, you should go ahead and enjoy this while you can, Bobby. Because if your evil genie actually does grant your wish, and I disappear, the only person you'll have left to contend with around here will be yourself. And when you really get to know that person oh, dear God you'll scream so loud that Satan will want to rip up the contract you signed at birth, just so he can get some sleep.
1686	Dr. Kelso	Look at you with your stiff upper lip. I think I'm going to miss that the most.
1687	Dr. Cox	What are you looking at?
1688	J.D.	Oh, no, I just... I-I like your shirt. Wh-what-what kind of shirt is that?
1689	Dr. Cox	It's a white t-shirt.
1690	J.D.	I knew it! Heh.

1692	Turk	I will never sleep at your place again.

1694	Elliot	I am in such a good mood!
1695	Turk	Does your mother invite the priest over for breakfast every day?
1696	Carla	Only when she finds me in bed with some guy.... So, yeah, most days.
1697	Turk	That's not funny, okay? That's not funny.
1698	Elliot	I'm just in a much better place, you know? Do I look different?
1699	J.D.	"What kind of shirt is that." I am-I am such an idiot!
1700	Elliot	I'm in a better place!
1701	Turk	What do you say? My apartment, tonight?
1702	Carla	I'll think about it.
1703	Elliot	Why doesn't anyone ever listen to me?
1704	Turk	'In a better place', 'look different', 'feel good', 'kay? That's what usually happens when you see a shrink.
1705	Elliot	My patient happens to be a therapist, I'm not 'seeing a shrink.'
1706	Turk	Okay.
1707	Elliot	And I would appreciate it if you'd stop spreading around embarrassing rumors like that.
1708	Turk	Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm just goofing around. Besides, the last thing I want to do is upset a crazy lady.

1714	Jordan	It's okay, come on in.
1715	Jordan	I meant, come in the room, not in here. What's the matter with you? Are you even a real doctor?
1716	J.D.	Look, I know that you're on the Board, and I have this friend well, he's not really a friend, he's more like a mentor....
1717	Jordan	Losing interest!
1718	J.D.	Sorry. He's a.... Wait, wait, wh-why are you dressed?
1719	Jordan	Oh, I'm going to a party. I assume my tests are normal, or else you wouldn't be chatting me up.
1720	Jordan	But, gosh, Huckleberry, I sure hope we can go down to the river sometime and race frogs!
1721	J.D.'s Thoughts	That's it!
1722	J.D.	Listen, you spoiled, bossy, chore of a woman.
1723	Jordan	I'm sorry, what'd you just say?
1724	J.D.'s Thoughts	You're in now, go for it.
1725	J.D.	I'm the doctor, here. So put your gown back on, get back in bed, and shut the hell up.
1726	Jordan	No one talks to me that way!
1727	J.D.	Well, get used to it...missy.
1728	J.D.	Uhm... I didn't mean to be such a hard-ass just now. You can totally wait until I'm gone to put your gown back on.

1763	J.D.	"Perry"?
1764	Dr. Cox	You never heard that.
1765	J.D.'s Thoughts	I never heard that, I'm not here, and I don't have your ex-wife's bite mark on my neck.
1766	Dr. Cox	Don't look her in the eyes, newbie; she'll steal your soul. So, how are things going down in the underworld?
1767	Jordan	Good. And you? Still have a rollicking social life?
1768	Dr. Cox	Since I cut you loose, it's been one big party!

1803	Dr. Cox	No!

1818	Dr. Cox	Do you understand that she would have gotten hurt whether you were there or not?
1819	Carla	Nuh-uh.
1820	Dr. Cox	She fell in the shower. So, unless you two have an extremely disturbing relationship, I'm afraid you're full of crap.
1821	Carla	I'm full of crap!? If you don't care about being suspended, why are you here?
1822	Carla	You may scare everybody else with those crazy eyes, but you don't scare me.
1823	Dr. Cox	You use your mom as an excuse to not take chances.
1824	Carla	You're never happy unless you're here.
1825	Dr. Cox	Admit you're afraid to live your own life!
1826	Carla	Admit that losing this place would kill you!

1832	J.D.'s Thoughts	There are other ways to save Dr. Cox's job.
1833	J.D.'s Thoughts	I could try talking to Dr. Kelso.
1834	J.D.'s Thoughts	Dr. Cox could get extensive plastic surgery to look like Jimmie Walker.
1835	"Dr. Cox"	This guy's gonna need 30 MAQs of KCL.
1836	J.D.'s Thoughts	Or, I could just ask Jimmie Walker to talk to Dr. Kelso.
1837	Jimmie Walker	Your man Cox is the best. I know he's got an unorthodox way of doing things, but all the innovators do!
1838	Jimmie Walker	Now, everybody deserves a second chance; am I right?
1839	Dr. Kelso	Who are you?
1840	J.D.'s Thoughts	Or I could get back to the problem at hand.
1841	J.D.	Jordan!
1842	J.D.	Look, I know you're on your way to the board meeting, and I know you don't really like me, but
1843	Jordan	I don't dislike you I nothing you.
1844	J.D.	Oh, thanks, that's that's special. Look, I have to ask you a favor, but you have to know this is not why we slept together.
1845	Jordan	Yeah, you had nothing to do with why we slept together.
1846	J.D.	I think we both know that's not completely true.
1847	Jordan	Oh, please. Even though you're terrified the Good Dr. Cox'll find out, if I wanted you to go to his apartment right now and have sex with me in front of him, you would.
1848	J.D.	Please don't do that.
1849	Jordan	You know, you remind me of him when he was younger.
1850	J.D.	Then, Jordan, look into your heart and see if you can dig up some sympathy for someone who means a whole lot to me; and probably means a little to you, too.
1851	J.D.	So will you help him?
1852	Jordan	Oh, sweetie.... No.

1854	Turk	You know, I went to therapy once.
1855	Elliot	You did?
1856	Turk	Yeah. Once, though, like, back in '93 to '94; and then three months in '95; and then I went to Group which was a disaster. Okay, when I went away to college, it was my first time away from home. And so, things started piling up, and I felt like I was sinking, you know?
1857	Elliot	Yeah, I do.
1858	Turk	No matter how embarrassing you think it might be, it's always helpful to talk to someone neutral. For example, take a look at me: I am now thanks to therapy in a healthy relationship with a beautiful woman who won't sleep over at my house because she thinks I broke her mother's leg.
1859	Turk	Hey! Baby!
1860	Turk	How long you been back there for? Y-y-you were there for a second, huh? Because, you know, I wasn't talking about us, I was

1865	Dr. Cox	YES! I am bullet-proof!
1866	J.D.'s Thoughts	He's taking it well.
1867	Lawyer	So, uh, no hard feelings, right, amigo?
1868	Dr. Cox	Careful....
1869	Lawyer	Catch you on the flip-side!
1870	Dr. Kelso	I really think you're making a big mistake.
1871	Dr. Kelso	You see, the most destructive thing about Dr.
1872	Jordan	Yawn! You see, I saw "yawn," because when I actually yawn, you don't get it.
1873	Dr. Kelso	See you in hell.
1874	J.D.'s Narration	I don't know why she did it; maybe I got to her, maybe she knows how much the hospital needs him, maybe, somewhere, she remembers why she cared about him in the first place.
1875	Jordan	I did it 'cause the thought of you rotting here in this fluorescent tomb is more fun than tipping the valet with your alimony check.
1876	Dr. Cox	Oh, listen here, pumpkin, if you're honestly having this much trouble getting over me, just go ahead and give me a call and I'll toss you a sympathy throw-down anytime.
1877	J.D.'s Narration	Whatever the reason, it made me realize that every ending leads to new complications....

1888	Dr. Cox	You asked her for help, didn't you.
1889	J.D.	Look, I don't think you realize how important you are to some people around here.
1890	J.D.'s Narration	I'll always remember that moment as the first "thank you" I got from Dr. Cox.
1891	Dr. Cox	Well, geez, Agnes, does the field hockey team know that you're missing?
1892	J.D.'s Narration	It felt good.
1893	Dr. Cox	Although, it did take some stones to be honest.
1894	J.D.	Stick with the truth, and you can't get hurt; it's just always been my philosophy.
1895	Dr. Cox	You didn't sleep with her, did you?

1902	J.D.'s Narration	...It keeps me on top of my game...
1903	J.D.	Looks like a break in the ulna, right there.
1904	J.D.'s Narration	It's good to be the king.
1905	J.D.	You know, it's it's okay to be impressed by me most girls are.
1906	J.D.'s Narration	The only problem with reaching the top is that sooner or later someone starts nipping at your heels.
1907	J.D.'s Narration	...For me, that guy was Nick Murdoch.

1913	Nurse Roberts	Doctor.... Peter's drug rash is getting a lot worse.
1914	Nick	No problem. Just give him Prednisone and Benadryl. I'll go...

1922	J.D.	Hey, how are you?
1923	J.D.	Oh, okay. There there that is.
1924	Nick	Gosh, can you believe we're doctors? The other night, I'm at a restaurant and this guy starts choking. They asked if anyone was a doctor, I didn't even move!
1925	J.D.	Yeah, I know. I still feel like I'm seven years old, playing 'MASH' with my older brother.
1926	Little J.D.	I don't wanna be HotLips again!
1927	J.D.'s Brother	Shut up, and kiss Frank.
1928	J.D.	I don't talk to my brother much.

1931	Nick	Okay.
1932	J.D.	Wait. Whatever happened to the guy in the restaurant?
1933	Nick	Oh, eventually I remembered I was a doctor; 'course, he'd been dead for twenty minutes very embarrassing. Food was good, though.

1950	Dr. Wen	Nice clean cut. Good. Good. Whoa. Whoa! What's that smell?
1951	Turk	I don't know.
1952	Dr. Wen	Did you nick the colon?
1953	Turk	No! I mean I don't know. I-I-I-I don't think so. Did I?

1956	Elliot	You know, I kinda had a date last night.
1957	J.D.	Really?
1958	Elliot	Yeah. Guy on the bus fell asleep on me, and drooled on my shoulder.
1959	J.D.	You slut.
1960	Elliot	Yeah.
1961	J.D.	How about Nick?
1962	Elliot	Oh... I'd let him drool on me. Oh, that's gross, why did I say that? I I shouldn't talk to people. Besides, I wouldn't know what to do even if I was interested.
1963	J.D.	Well, you could start by looking at him.
1964	Elliot	Did he look back, did he like me? Why doesn't he like me? I can't believe I already blew it.
1965	J.D.'s Narration	It felt weird trying to push Nick on her. I mean, this morning I wanted to kill the guy; but the truth is, he's so nice, he probably would've helped me.
1966	Nick	Come on, J.D., you're not closing the windpipe you gotta put more pressure down here. Come on, I know you can do it! Come on! Come on!
1967	Dr. Kelso	Ahh, if it isn't the brain trust. Someone tell me what this patient's rash is. You have until I finish my squeezy-juice.
1968	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, my God, I'm drawing a.... Oh, my God, I can't even remember what you draw when your mind draws a...something!
1969	Nick	It's Erythema Migrans.
1970	J.D.	Then why don't you just answer it?
1971	Nick	Everyone looks up to you. It's important to them that you don't get stumped. Besides, come on, it's important to you, too.
1972	J.D.'s Thoughts	Please. Like he knows me.
1973	J.D.	It's, uh, Erythema Migrans, sir!
1974	Dr. Kelso	Right you are, Dr. Dorian!

1986	J.D.'s Thoughts	Time to put myself right back on top of Nick.... That came out wrong.

1988	Dr. Cox	Yeah, sure, congratulations. Now...go.
1989	J.D.'s Thoughts	Mission accomplished.
1990	Nick	Hey, buddy! How are ya?
1991	Nick	Uh, Dr. Cox, I was wondering if I could co-write that case report with you.
1992	Dr. Cox	Wow. This is good. Newbie-on-newbie. Too bad it can't be a fight to the death.
1993	Nick	Oh, no, no, no. I didn't know you wanted to do it. You do it.
1994	J.D.	No
1995	Nick	You'll be great.
1996	J.D.	Well I O-okay.

2006	Nick	Huge moment for me.
2007	Dr. Cox	I know.
2008	Nick	Wish my dad was alive.
2009	J.D.'s Thoughts	Doesn't mean anything.
2010	J.D.	So, what, you just, like, flipped a coin in your head, or...?
2011	Dr. Cox	No. It's just that, right now, he's better at internal medicine than you are.
2012	J.D.	Okay, go, you know, insult me like you always do.

2018	Turk	You know, even though nothing happened today, it's still kinda freakin' me out.
2019	Todd	Mm-hmm.
2020	Turk	I mean, one flinch, one hiccup, and that's the difference between life and death?
2021	Todd	Mm.
2022	Turk	It's a lot to have on your shoulders, you know?
2023	Todd	Mm.
2024	Carla	Hey. What're you guys talking about?
2025	Todd	Cheese.
2026	Carla	Turk is so lucky I met him first.
2027	Carla	How's my man doing?
2028	Turk	Baby, most guys are here but me, I'm, like, all up in here! Heh!
2029	Dr. Wen	Dr. Turk, you can make the incision now.
2030	Turk	Sir, um.... My hand's tightening up; I must be low on potassium.

2033	Nurse Roberts	Dr. Murdoch. Peter's rash is gone, but he's vomited six times in the last hour.
2034	Nick	No problem. Just give him Zofran and a 20 C.C. per kilo bolus of normal saline.
2035	J.D.'s Thoughts	I think everyone's finally coming around to my way of thinking about Nick.
2036	Carla	You're right, he definitely has a cute little butt.
2037	Elliot	Oh, it's almost like it's been sculpted.
2038	J.D.	Who cares? Everybody's got a cute butt; _I_ have a cute butt.
2039	Carla	You should bring it in someday.
2040	Elliot	Hey, how's Turk doing?
2041	Carla	He's fine, why?
2042	Elliot	Because he totally froze during surgery yesterday? Didn't he tell you?
2043	Carla	No....
2044	Carla	Hey, you!
2045	Turk	Hey. Hey!
2046	Carla	I feel like we haven't talked in ages.
2047	Turk	Mm.
2048	Carla	How are you?
2049	Turk	Fine.
2050	Carla	Yeah?
2051	Turk	Don't I look okay? You know...
2052	Turk	You know? I'm fine.

2055	Dr. Kelso	Good afternoon, doctors. I've gathered you all here because, well, attendance at my new conferences has been very disappointing. In fact, I've begun to wonder if maybe you have something more important to do. Maybe you feel the need to sneak off and have a little nappy-nap. I love nappy-naps. Or...maybe you've forgotten that my conferences are mandatory! My hospital, my rules!
2056	J.D.	Actually, sir, I've never missed one. I just wanted to... Battin' a thousand over here!
2057	Dr. Kelso	Son, I'm more proud of you than I've ever been of an intern.
2058	J.D.'s Thoughts	How you like me now, Nick? Uh-oh.
2059	Nick	So, you see, sir, the poor attendance is my fault. And my fault, only.
2060	Dr. Kelso	Well, then. You have just won the privilege of writing my next ten lectures by...this afternoon.
2061	J.D.	Paging Dr. Martyr. I mean what the hell was that guy
2062	Elliot	Nick? That was amazing.
2063	He modestly waves away her adoration. The murmurs continue	"That was incredible." "You are the man!"
2064	J.D.	....Thinking.
2065	J.D.'s Thoughts	It's good to be the king.

2067	J.D.'s Narration	Things change when you're not the star anymore.
2068	Dr. Kelso	What can I say? The lectures this kid wrote for me were fantastic!
2069	J.D.'s Narration	The hospital starts to seem like a whole different place.
2070	J.D.	Hey, man. Want some company?
2071	Turk	Nah. I just wanna be alone.
2072	J.D.	Well?
2073	Janitor	Not yet. But soon. Very soon.

2075	Carla	Why would Turk talk to Elliot about this and not me, anyway? They're not even friends, you know what I mean?
2076	Dr. Cox	After twenty-five minutes, the only way I could know what you mean more is if you wrote "My boyfriend doesn't open up to me" on a big wooden mallet and repeatedly smashed me over the head with it.
2077	Carla	Why can't you just, for once, dig deep down into your heart, access some emotions, and empathize with me.
2078	Dr. Cox	I'm sorry, uh, what were we doing?
2079	Carla	See? That's why no one likes you.
2080	Dr. Cox	Hey. You like me a little bit.
2081	Dr. Cox	And so do you, sweetcakes. Huh? Want a little sugar from daddy?
2082	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2083	Dr. Kelso	Well, lookie, here. I thought this was my special place. I'd ask you not to tell any of the others about this spot, but none of them seem to be talking to you.
2084	J.D.	Uh...it's been a rough day, sir.
2085	Dr. Kelso	You see, Dr. Dorian, your problem is...you're a pansy. If you were in my way, I'd throw you off this ledge right now. We're out here alone.... No one would ever know.

2093	Nick	Nah.
2094	Nick	But I promise I will before you go home.
2095	Elliot	Works for me.
2096	Nurse Roberts	Dr. Murdoch. Peter's developed a high-grade fever and a cough.
2097	Nick	No problem. Just give him Ceftazidime one gram IV.
2098	Elliot	How do you stay so positive?
2099	Nick	I guess I don't let the bad stuff in, you know? Try not to get too overwhelmed.
2100	Nick	Call me tonight when you get my message.
2101	Elliot	Okay.

2108	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2109	Turk	See, what I did was I took 'potassium', and...I dropped the first three letters.... Made a doodie joke.
2110	Dr. Wen	Funny stuff.
2111	Dr. Cox	Looks like he bought it.
2112	Turk	Excuse me?
2113	Dr. Cox	So you got a little stage-fright, it's no big deal. Happened to me once.
2114	Turk	Really?
2115	Dr. Cox	I'll be more than glad to tell you what a lot of doctors do to relieve the stress: Just take a little trip to "Palmdale."
2116	Turk	What?
2117	Dr. Cox	Okay give yourself the old "low-five."
2118	Turk	I'm not getting it.
2119	Dr. Cox	Physician, love thyself.
2120	Turk	Are you talkin' about down-town, Lester Brown?
2121	Dr. Cox	Lowers the heart-rate, releases the endorphins, it's basic physiology.
2122	Turk	Okay, you almost had me.
2123	Turk	You're not serious.
2124	Dr. Cox	Yes, I am.
2125	Turk	No, you're not.
2126	Dr. Cox	Yes.

2132	Dr. Cox	This kid doesn't leave, I'm gonna kill him.

2139	J.D.	Oh, you got it.
2140	J.D.'s Narration	Whether or not Nick knew how petty and jealous and competitive I'd been, I still felt like I needed to step up, lay it out there, and apologize like a man.
2141	J.D.	We cool?
2142	Nick	Yeah.
2143	J.D.'s Narration	Besides, even if I was the star for a little while, he's the man now.

2158	Carla	I shouldn't have dragged you into it, anyway. You don't even know Turk.
2159	Dr. Cox	Actually, I met him today. We had a terrific chat.
2160	Dr. Cox	Oh, give the man a hand. That's just terrific work. You know darn well that felt good. And you're feeling better about yourself, now, aren'cha?
2161	Dr. Cox	Real nice guy.

2168	Elliot	Look at me. That was the old Elliot.
2169	Nurse Roberts	Hey, can you help me find Dr. Murdoch? Peter's parents are here and he's not answering his page.

2176	Carla	Turk bought me this dress, out of the blue. I guess he knew I'd love it.
2177	Dr. Cox	Oh. Look, Carla. Back when I was an intern, I remember the pressure being so insane that the only way I could get by was to race home and, even though my wife was already asleep, I'd gently wake her, look her in the eyes, and then I'd passive-aggressively torture her until she packed a bag and went to her mom's place for the week.
2178	Carla	Oh...!
2179	Dr. Cox	Does that...help?
2180	Carla	Like a big hug with words.
2181	Dr. Cox	Hey! The point is that just 'cause a guy has problems expressing himself, that doesn't mean he doesn't need...you.
2182	Dr. Cox	Oh, boy. Women so don't get me... it's not even funny!

2187	J.D.	Nick! Touch my butt, please? ...Hey, you all right?
2188	Nick	That kid is eventually gonna die. Whether it's today, or tomorrow, or a month from now. There's nothing I can do; nothing works. Now his parents want to talk to me, what am I supposed to tell them "Peter lived a good, long seven years"? Seven years, man!
2189	Nick	It's not fair. I hate this place. I hate this job
2190	Elliot	Nick, it's not your fault
2191	Nick	I can't do it anymore. I I'm done...I'm done...I'm done.
2192	J.D.'s Narration	The scariest thing was that I thought he was stronger than all of us. But maybe it's not about being the best. Maybe it's about finding the little things that get you through the day.
2193	J.D.'s Narration	Whether it's the support of someone close to you...
2194	J.D.'s Narration	...or letting yourself feel overwhelmed...
2195	Elliot	Okay....

2213	Turk	Oh, don't even think about it that way. This is just a nice place to buy a burger that's a short, convenient two-and-a-half-mile walk away from the hospital.
2214	Now within sight of the club, they stop when they notice a small group of people marching around outside the front doors with signs in their hands. As one, they chant	"No skin! We all win!! No skin! We all win!!"

2237	Elliot	An A-plus. But, then I turned on the water-works and the resident changed it to an A-plus-plus.
2238	J.D.	It's a proud day for women everywhere.
2239	Elliot	What are you worried about? With the whole "hero" thing, whoever evaluates you is gonna give you a gold star.

2280	Dr. Kelso	Can't do it.
2281	Lawyer	Well, you did what you could!
2282	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Dorian, how are you?
2283	J.D.	Well, sir, these evaluations...
2284	Dr. Kelso	It's just a pleasantry, sport; let's keep it moving. Listen, I've been thinking, with all the publicity you and your friend have been getting, it would be silly not to milk it a little bit see if we can't promote the hospital. What do you say?
2285	J.D.	Okay, whose breasts haven't I signed yet?
2286	J.D.	It could happen!
2287	Dr. Kelso	Excuse me?
2288	J.D.	Anything for the hospital, sir!
2289	Elliot	So, what are we doing tonight?
2290	Carla	Oh...go out to dinner, I guess.
2291	Elliot	Ooh, dinner! Where're we gonna eat?
2292	Carla	Oh, I don't know, some restaurant.
2293	Elliot	Mmm! Some restaurant!
2294	Elliot	Be honest, um, does this look, uh, "hip" enough?
2295	Carla	Since when are khakis, a pink shirt, and a neckerchief not hip?
2296	Elliot	True.
2297	Carla	Hey!
2298	Patricia	Hi!
2299	Carla	Hey, Darryl.
2300	Carla	Um, I have to make a quick call. So, Patricia, Darryl, this is Elliot.
2301	Elliot	Hi!
2302	Patricia	Nice to meet you.
2303	Elliot	Nice to meet you, too.
2304	Darryl	I'm gonna get out of here, all right?
2305	Patricia	Okay. Thanks for the ride.
2306	Elliot	Oooh, someone's a cradle-robber!
2307	Patricia	Darryl's my son.
2308	Elliot	Oh, come on, the only way he could be your son is if you had him when you were, like, fifteen.
2309	Patricia	Fourteen.
2310	Elliot	Oh.... I was close!
2311	Carla	Listen, I'm really sorry, that was my mom I'm gonna have to cancel.
2312	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2313	J.D.'s Thoughts	I can't evaluate myself.
2314	J.D.	Would you describe me as 'warm', 'professional', or both?
2315	Nurse Roberts	I describe you as: I'm on my lunch.
2316	J.D.	I dunno whether to be easy or hard on myself. I mean, either way
2317	Nurse Roberts	Can't you see I'm watching my stories?
2318	J.D.	Dr. Cox? Have you been here the whole time?
2319	Dr. Cox	No; I just came in through the couch door. Move.
2320	J.D.	But I thought you said you were too busy to do my evaluation?
2321	Dr. Cox	I am. Didn't her daddy sell the coal mine?
2322	Nurse Roberts	Contract didn't stick.
2323	Dr. Cox	Ohhh. That's interesting.
2324	Nurse Roberts	Uhh-huh.
2325	Dr. Cox	Mmm-hmm.
2326	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2327	Reporter	'Kay, well, we're almost ready. Is there anything you want to say before we get started?
2328	J.D.	Yeah, I got something to say to Dr. Cox! I'm gonna give you the best damn evaluation that you ever did see! And this Friday, at the steel-cage mmmedi-slam, I'm gonna give you a physical that you ain't never gonna forget! I'm gonna probe ya 'cause I'm The Intern!!!
2329	Reporter	Nothing! Okay, I'll be right back.
2330	J.D.	She is ta-haasty. Watch me work a little cat-and-mouse game with her.
2331	Turk	She's married to the sound-man, bud. And that little thing that's clipped to your collar, that's a microphone.
2332	J.D.	I am so sorry.... And I love ZZ Top.
2333	Turk	I'm not looking forward to this.
2334	Reporter	Okay, we're rolling. So, how is my cameraman doing?
2335	J.D.	Well, good enough that he asked me for mouth-to-mouth again!
2336	Reporter	Dr. Turk, um, are there any specific challenges being a young black doctor in an inner-city hospital?
2337	Turk	...My nieces and nephews really look up to me...
2338	Elliot	I'm I'm sorry, I really want to hear this. Is it possible to turn the volume just a little?
2339	Bartender	That's as high as it goes.
2340	Carla	Elliot.
2341	Carla	Hi! Listen, let me tell you what happened....
2342	Carla	Elliot! ... Damn.

2344	Janitor	When I saw that it was missing, did you not think I'd come to you?
2345	J.D.	I don't know what you're talking about.
2346	Janitor	Oh. So you're gonna play it that way, huh? Touche.
2347	J.D.	I, uh, finished my evaluation.
2348	Dr. Cox	Oh, great. I thought it was gonna take you a little longer, so the marching band won't be here until this evening.
2349	J.D.	Enjoy. I think you'll find it's a good read.
2350	Dr. Cox	Hey, Newbie. This thing actually does matter, so tell me, were you completely honest with yourself?
2351	J.D.	Well, yeah....
2352	Dr. Cox	Say it right into the camera, there, hotshot. Now, you can have this thing back anytime you want. You're gonna have to bark like a dog, though.
2353	J.D.	I'm I'm not...gonna bark like a
2354	Dr. Cox	It's your call.
2355	J.D.	Woof!
2356	Dr. Cox	Good boy.
2357	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2358	J.D.'s Thoughts	At the very least, I'm gonna end today on a good note.
2359	J.D.	Yo, I got something to show you.
2360	Turk	This isn't one of those uncomfortable moments that'll change our friendship, is it?
2361	J.D.	No, no, no! You're going to like it!
2362	Turk	Good. 'Cause I need some good news, man. Can you believe that newslady? "What's it like to be a black doctor?"
2363	Turk	I just wish this was over.
2364	Turk	Why have we stopped?
2365	J.D.	Roll 'em up.... Roll 'em up.
2366	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2367	Reopen	Turk and J.D.'s Apartment, exterior Night
2368	Turk	What makes you think I'd wanna be part of this, J.D.?
2369	J.D.	I don't know! Kelso said it would make us role models. I guess I just assumed that
2370	Turk	Yeah, everybody assumes that I'm a good athlete, or or or that I grew up poor, or that I love 'Sanford and Son'.
2371	J.D.	But you do love 'Sanford and Son'.... We both do.
2372	J.D.	Bum-bum-bwa-dum. Bum-bum-bwa-dum-bwa-dum-bum.
2373	Turk	Bum-bum-bwa-dum.
2374	J.D.	That's what I'm talkin' about.
2375	Cut to	The Center of the Living Room A Few Moments Later
2376	Turk	Listen, if Dr. Kelso wants me to be a "role model" for the community because I'm a great doctor, then that's great, and I will sign on the dotted line. But that's not what this is about. All my life, I've been singled out because I'm black.
2377	Young Turk	But I didn't even enter the contest!
2378	Teacher	Shh. Smile for the picture.
2379	Turk	Remember our college brochures?
2380	J.D.	So what, they put you on the cover.
2381	Turk	Twice?
2382	Turk	Ohh? Ohh!
2383	J.D.	Come on, it's different this time. Now it's both of us.
2384	Flash to	One of the promotional posters...
2385	Flash to	A park bench...
2386	Flash to	Yet another poster, plastered on a wall of the hospital...
2387	J.D.	You can still see my hand on your shoulder.
2388	J.D.'s Narration	And that's when I realized, I'm not gonna let people take advantage of me anymore.
2389	J.D.	Look, this is so unfair, you're supposed to do my evaluation not me. And, you know what? You're gonna do it, buddy-boy.
2390	Dr. Cox	"Buddy-boy"? Why...I...oughtta....
2391	J.D.	I'm serious.
2392	Dr. Cox	Relax, Newbie. It's just an evaluation; it should be easy.
2393	J.D.	Well, if it's that easy, then it won't take you that long to do it.
2394	Dr. Cox	All right, well, don't you worry about it another minute, there, Newbie. I'll evaluate you, I'll evaluate the hell right outta ya.
2395	J.D.	When?
2396	Dr. Cox	Oh, just the second I get off work.
2397	J.D.	Fine!
2398	Dr. Cox	Fine!
2399	J.D.	Great!
2400	Dr. Cox	Great!
2401	J.D.	Here it is.
2402	J.D.	You get off, like, six-ish, er...?
2403	Dr. Cox	Oh, danger. Ohh, ohhh!

2405	Turk	You know, you're gonna have to see her eventually.
2406	Carla	No I don't; 'cause I know the layout to the air-duct system here like the back of my hand.
2407	Carla	Of course I'm gonna have to see her again!
2408	Turk	So, what, this is the part where all of a sudden it's my fault?
2409	Carla	Turk, if you could have seen the look on her face I'm telling you, if I think about it again, it's gonna make me cry.
2410	Carla	What am I gonna do?
2411	Turk	It's simple: just keep doing what you're doing. Eventually she'll quit and move.
2412	Carla	Why am I even talking to you?
2413	Turk	What?
2414	Carla	You're such a guy. You can't even begin to understand something this deep on any kind of real emotional level.
2415	J.D.	Hey, Turk. Look, I'm really sorry about the whole poster thing. It was racially insensitive of me; I should have been more aware of your feelings before I went ahead and spoke for you.
2416	Turk	It's okay; your intentions were good, and there's never been an issue of race between us. Since the day I met you, you've been nothing but a friend to me.
2417	J.D.	I love you, man.
2418	Turk	Hit me one.
2419	J.D.	Keep it real!
2420	Turk	Yeah, we've got some things to work out, but, we'll get there... We'll get there.
2421	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2422	Elliot	...Sure, it hurts. You know what? I'm not gonna wallow in self pity. Right after work, I'm gonna go straight downtown and just...tear it up, you know? Maybe I'll have a cigarette; just get a little crazy and head wherever the night takes me.
2423	Nurse Roberts	What's that, now?
2424	Elliot	Thanks so much!
2425	Elliot	TAXI!
2426	Bum	Hey, baby! How much?
2427	Bum	Hey! Where're you go ? Don't go away mad!

2432	Janitor	Then why take it?

2434	Dr. Kelso	Well, if it isn't Dr. Turk, the friendly face of Sacred Heart.
2435	Turk	Yeah.... Dr. Kelso, um, about these posters , they're kind of making me uncomfortable.
2436	Dr. Kelso	Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't realize you felt that way. Well, here's what I'm gonna do: I'm gonna leave 'em up.
2437	Turk	I can live with that. Or, I can sue you.
2438	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Turk, you are an employee, here. I can advertise however I wish. I can use your image, your name, I can manufacture tiny little Dr. Turk action figures it'll cost $12.95, and when you pull the string it'll say, "I don't like these posters of me!" Isn't that right, Ted?
2439	Lawyer	Oh, definitely, sir.
2440	Lawyer	Of course, you'd certainly be vulnerable from a legal standpoint.
2441	Dr. Kelso	How vulnerable?
2442	Lawyer	Sir, that lawsuit would be over so quickly, I'd advise you to bring cab fare to the courthouse, since Dr. Turk will be driving your Beemer home to his place.
2443	Dr. Kelso	Hippie!
2444	Lawyer	God, that felt good!
2445	Turk	Who's the man?
2446	Lawyer	Is it me?
2447	Turk	Damn right, it's you!
2448	Lawyer	Oh.

2453	Carla	Elliot, there's no excuse for what I did.
2454	Elliot	No, there's not.
2455	Elliot	Are we done?
2456	Carla	I'm really sorry.
2457	Elliot	Don't be. If I was going out with my friend, I wouldn't invite you.
2458	Elliot	Who am I kidding. Yes, I would, and she'd probably like you better and neither one of you would ever talk to me again.
2459	Carla	Look, I only did it because I hadn't seen Patricia in a long time.
2460	Elliot	Carla, you only did it 'cause I don't fit in with you and your friend. It's no surprise, it's not like I've ever really fit in anywhere.
2461	Nurse Roberts	Carla, your friend Patricia's here. There's a little problem with her son.
2462	Nurse Roberts	Why so sad, Marshmallow?
2463	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2464	J.D.'s Thoughts	Stay calm, stay calm, stay calm. Oh, good; he's not here.
2465	J.D.	Dr. Cox?
2466	Dr. Cox	It's time. Sit down.
2467	Dr. Cox	Now, what do you want me to say? That you're great? That you're raising the bar for interns everywhere?
2468	J.D.	I'm cool with that.
2469	Dr. Cox	I'm not gonna say that. You're okay. You might be better than that someday; but right now, all I see is a guy who's so worried about what everybody else thinks of him that he has no real belief in himself.
2470	Dr. Cox	I mean, did you even wonder why I told you to do your own evaluation?
2471	J.D.	I-I can't think of a safe answer. I just figured
2472	Dr. Cox	Clam up! I wanted you to think about yourself and I mean really think. What are you good at? What do you suck at? And then I wanted you to put it down on paper. And not so I could see it, and not so anybody else could see it, but so that you could see it. Because, ultimately, you don't have to answer to me, and you don't have to answer to Kelso, you don't even have to answer to your patients, for God's sake! You only have to answer to one guy, Newbie, and that's you!
2473	Dr. Cox	There. You. Are.... Evaluated.
2474	Dr. Cox	Now get the hell outta my sight. You honest-to-God get me so angry, I'm afraid I just might hurt myself.

2476	Darryl	So, what are you, one of the male nurses?
2477	Turk	No, actually, I'm a surgeon. I'm doing this as a favor for Carla.
2478	Darryl	Yeah, Carla is fine.
2479	Darryl	What's she doin' wit' you?
2480	Turk	Slummin' a little, God bless her heart. So, this is a knife cut, hey?
2481	Darryl	Yeah, it's cool.
2482	Turk	See this right here? Pinched it in a door two stitches!
2483	Darryl	Oh, man, yeah, yeah, you hard-core, man.
2484	Turk	Hell, yeah!
2485	Elliot	Look, Darryl's gonna be fine. But I'm worried about you; you're a little upset, so I'm gonna set you up in a room with some fluids, maybe give you a Valium, okay?
2486	Patricia	Elliot, thank you.
2487	Carla	Hey, there you are.
2488	Patricia	Oh, honey.
2489	Carla	Elliot, you're coming, right?
2490	Elliot	In a sec.
2491	Carla	You all right?
2492	Patricia	Yes.
2493	J.D.'s Narration	It's funny how our perceptions can be so off....
2494	Nurse Roberts	Hot cocoa, sweetie?
2495	Elliot	Thanks.
2496	Nurse Roberts	Anytime.
2497	J.D.'s Narration	...Like, when you're searching for a place to fit in, and you don't even realize you've been there the whole time.
2498	J.D.'s Narration	Or how a bunch of posters can't turn you into a role model if you've already been one for years.
2499	Turk	Hell yeah!
2500	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, in my case, I knew exactly where I stood. And it didn't feel that good.
2501	Dr. Cox	I would like to make special mention of one intern here: John Dorian. Smart kid, he's extremely confident, and his enthusiasm and his determination to always be better is something I see in him 24 hours a day. He cares. Probably cares too much. But he's definitely somebody you don't want to lose.
2502	Dr. Cox	Now, if you have any questions, uh...well, I could give a crap; I'm goin' home. You all get paid way too much for doing nothing, anyway.
2503	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2504	Dr. Cox	Oh, good, Newbie you found a specialty.
2505	J.D.	Nah.... I just dropped my...pen!
2506	Janitor	Well, look what magically found its way back home.
2507	J.D.	What, your window cleaner?
2508	Janitor	No. Ammonia. This is window cleaner, right, uh....
2509	Janitor	Why!?
2510	J.D.	Now that's just bad luck.
2511	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2512	J.D.	As a first year intern you have very little free time. So when you finally have a night off, it's important that you do something constructive with it.
2513	Turk	Hey! Hey! Over here man!
2514	J.D.	Hey man how's it goin?
2515	J.D.	I have no idea who you are.
2516	J.D.	What up dude!
2517	J.D.'s Narration	Hey wait a second he's dating Carla. This is not good.
2518	Turk	First of all I already told her I got a girlfriend. Second you just put your bare lips on my ear.
2519	J.D.	How's it goin I'm-
2520	Jennifer	J.D., I know. He won't stop talking about you. I'm Jennifer.
2521	J.D.'s Narration	Mmm Jennifer.
2522	Jennifer	Do you really spend every day saving children's lives.
2523	Turk	Tell the nice lady.
2524	J.D.	I do what I can.
2525	Turk	It's on, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on!
2526	J.D.'s Narration	I know two things about bars, one they're always packed the week of Thanksgiving and two put a beer in my hand and I'm Mr. Smooth.
2527	Jennifer	I was laughing so hard milk was coming out of my nose.
2528	J.D.	Well, I once tripped over an I.V. and blood shot over everyone! Er uh a little got on my nose… Every damn day saving those children!
2529	Turk	Who wants margaritas? Dude, less blood more fruity drinks.
2530	J.D.	Right.
2531	J.D.'s Narration	That's the thing about Turk he hasn't changed a bit since college. He's still the same goofball who tells me how to be cooler.
2532	Turk	Dude, this girl's pretty hot, so try not to blow it. Okay?
2533	J.D.	Why do you say that?
2534	Turk	Because you're like a 24 hour convenience store. You never close.
2535	J.D.	That sounds like a Fat Albert joke.
2536	J.D.	Don't worry about it man I feel good tonight, you know what I'm saying?. Except for this stabbing pain in my side.
2537	Turk	So he was up all night with a high fever, cramping and crying.
2538	J.D.	Dude!
2539	Turk	Oh my bad not crying. Punching the wall all manly and angry like. You know what I mean?
2540	Carla	Poor Bambi. Don't worry Carla will take care of you. Make sure he gets admitted right away.
2541	J.D.'s Narration	On the bright side it'll be interesting to see what it feels like to be a patient here.
2542	Janitor	You know people die here?
2543	J.D.	You're a good friend.
2544	Janitor	Eh, I do what I can. Can I have your stuff?
2545	Carla	So did you talk to any girls last night?
2546	Turk	Baby, I'm an attractive man we both know this. It's just a burden you'll have to live with.
2547	Carla	One of many.
2548	Turk	J.D. talked some girl up
2549	Elliot	Really are you gonna call her?
2550	Jennifer	Eh! Eck!
2551	J.D.	Not right away.
2552	Elliot	Alright, showtime. Clear out so I can check em out.
2553	J.D.	Whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah. You're examining me? I don't want you to see my unmentionables.
2554	Elliot	I've seen underwear before.
2555	J.D.	Actually I use the word unmentionables for my genitals as well.
2556	Carla	Sixty-eight year old male with respiratory distress and tightness in-
2557	Dr. Cox	Save your breath. Hello Dad.
2558	Dr. Benson	Never thought you'd call me that again after I left.
2559	Carla	Dr. Cox!
2560	Dr. Cox	Relax Carla the man I'm smothering isn't really my father. Dr Benson used to be the chief of medicine here.
2561	Dr. Benson	Oh hi how are ya?
2562	Dr. Benson	Still have that great rapport with the nurses huh?
2563	Dr. Cox	Actually Carla totally gets me. That's why I've been systematically trying to driver her away.
2564	Dr. Benson	You ever see that therapist I recommended?
2565	Dr. Cox	Not yet, no.
2566	Elliot	Shortness of breath, dizziness, problems urinating?
2567	J.D.	No, no, is it a problem if it whistles?
2568	Elliot	Oh, you're making this so much easier! Are you sexually active?
2569	J.D.	Oh it's active.
2570	Elliot	I'll write, rare dry spell in the margin. Okay time for the physical
2571	J.D.	Cold hands.
2572	Elliot	Suck it up!
2573	J.D's Narration	Elliot's exam was frighteningly reminiscent of when my older brother used to beat the crap out of me.
2574	J.D.	Ow!
2575	Elliot	See that wasn't so bad. All done.
2576	J.D.	I'm still puking every hour and my fever's pretty high but you're sure it's okay for me to be out of bed right?
2577	Dr. Cox	I don't know Dr. Benson was kind of my mentor, so don't do that annoying thing.
2578	J.D.	What annoying thing?
2579	Dr. Cox	You know when you talk.
2580	J.D.	Come on that's a little-
2581	Dr. Cox	See there it is. How does that not drive you crazy?
2582	Dr. Cox	I know you're all excited because got the gown on but under no circumstance are you to curtsy.
2583	J.D.'s Narration	He can say what he wants. The bottom line is he's showing me off.
2584	J.D.'s Narration	Watching Dr. Cox I realized we never really stop craving the attention of people we look up to.
2585	Dr. Cox	Any questions? Great.
2586	J.D.	He seemed nice.
2587	Dr. Cox	Careful newbie.
2588	J.D.	You know I'm hearing it now it is kind of annoying when I talk.
2589	J.D.'s Narration	I guess in a lot of relationships you regress to the person you were when you first met.
2590	Turk	So Elliot's uh exam was that bad ay?
2591	J.D.	Dude she violated me.
2592	Turk	In a good way?!
2593	Elliot	What's the deal?
2594	Turk	Ah! I think I broke my ass!
2595	Elliot	I heard you're telling everyone I violated you.
2596	J.D.	Not everyone, just the people that work here. Oh and my parents.
2597	Elliot	Was there something wrong with my exam?
2598	J.D.'s Narration	So there it is a classic trap. Two choices, either wuss out or tell the truth.
2599	J.D.	Well, you're kinda rough, yeah you're rough. And you're a little business like. Oh and you're cold.
2600	Elliot	Mm hm you mean my hands?
2601	J.D.	Yeah, those too. I just think you know you could be more comforting.
2602	J.D.'s Narration	I could tell she appreciated how hard it was for me to say that.
2603	Elliot	Do you know how annoying you are when you talk?
2604	J.D.'s Narration	Maybe not.
2605	J.D.	Hey I was watching that!
2606	Janitor	It's broken.
2607	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Cox, did you get my memo reminding all senior staff that lab coats must be worn at all times?
2608	Dr. Cox	You know I did get it there Bob, and at first I just threw it away. But then I decided that wasn't a grand enough gesture. So I made a replica of you out of straw and then I put my lab coat on it with your memo in the pocket and then I invited all the kids in the neighborhood to come over and light it on fire and whack it with sticks.
2609	Dr. Kelso	Uh huh, so I've been looking at Dr. Benson's chart. His chest X Ray was normal, his vitals are stable. So let's discharge him.
2610	Dr. Cox	Well now hold the phone there Skipper. Now, Dr. Benson should be able to stay here until he feels he's ready to go. I mean give me a break he was only the chief of medicine for ten years!
2611	Dr. Kelso	Well, I haven't had my coffee yet so I'm finding it hard coming up with a more colorful way to say who gives a crap? Actually that wasn't half bad.
2612	Dr. Kelso	Our next patient is a twenty-six year old male who has presented vomiting, abdominal cramps, and fever.
2613	J.D.'s Narration	I guess I never realized how hard rounds are on the patient. It feels like you're on display.
2614	Dr. Kelso	Still Rodin's masterpiece makes us wonder, why didn't he spend a little less time thinking and a little more time at the gym?
2615	J.D.	I do cardio.
2616	Dr. Kelso	Which most likely indicates what Dr. Reid?
2617	Elliot	I'd say he has a simple case of appendicitis.
2618	Dr. Kelso	And how would you proceed Dr. Dorian?
2619	J.D.	Well, for starters I would've given me that news in private no matter how angry I was at me.
2620	Dr. Kelso	Sounds like there's some fascinating back story here, turf him to surgery. Moving on.
2621	Carla	You better watch it Bambi you don't want a hundred pound white girl mad at you. You'll flinch every time you hear a range rover.
2622	J.D.	I can't believe I have to spend all Thanksgiving here. Tell me that wouldn't kill you.
2623	Carla	Not really.
2624	J.D.	Do they celebrate Thanksgiving in your homeland?
2625	Carla	You mean Chicago?
2626	J.D.	You have a Chicago? Be nice to me, I'm getting surgery.
2627	Carla	Dr. Wen's the attending.
2628	J.D.	Yeah but who's the intern who's gonna do all the work?
2629	Turk	I get to cut you open. I get to cut you open. I get to cut you open. I get to cut you open. I get to cut you open. Uh ooh ooh. Go girl, uh uh go get it. Uh uh and go uh and down and down. Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh.
2630	J.D.'s Narration	Oh good God
2631	Elliot	So, Mr. Davis we won't be able to have you home for Thanksgiving. But you'll be eating leftovers by like Saturday.
2632	Patient	Great, and Doctor thank you so much.
2633	Elliot	You're welcome. Hey we've gotten to know each other over the last week haven't we?
2634	Patient	I'd say so.
2635	Elliot	And as a doctor you found me comforting.
2636	Patient	God no.
2637	Elliot	Come on I'm pretty good with people.
2638	Patient	You're horrible with people.
2639	Elliot	I'm warm.
2640	Patient	You're very cold, I mean your hands it's like you're a yeti.
2641	Elliot	I have bad circulation. I- I do this all day and it doesn't help.
2642	Patient	Listen sweetie, you're a very efficient competent doctor but your exams- do you examine everyone like that or just people you feel have wronged you in some way.
2643	Elliot	Well, I appreciate your opinion-.
2644	Patient	Oh no it's not an opinion. You see those guys right there they're just pretending to be asleep so you won't manhandle them anymore.
2645	Elliot	They are not.
2646	Guy	Dude what are you doing?
2647	Patient	Too frank right? I know that's probably why my mom pushed me down the stairs. She is fat though… and boring.
2648	Carla	BP 60 over palp. Is he having a heart attack?
2649	Dr. Kelso	No it's hypotension and electrical alternans on the monitor. This is Tamponade. Viral infections can cause pericarditis and a rapid accumulation of fluid. It looks like a heart attack but don't let it fool you.
2650	Carla	BP's stabilizing
2651	Dr. Cox	What do we got?
2652	Dr. Kelso	Don't worry we're fine here.
2653	J.D.'s Narration	I think it's a universal feeling to wanna be there for a good friend. That's why from now on I'm gonna stop seeing Turk as my crazy frat brother.
2654	Dr. Wen	Dr. Turk if you will.
2655	Turk	Mark for the incision right about here.
2656	J.D.'s	After all he's a highly trained competent young doctor.
2657	Turk	Dude! I'm about to bust a mad slizzice in your insides!
2658	J.D.	Sir I'd prefer it if someone other than Dr. Turk performed the surgery.
2659	Dr. Wen	Fair enough. Dr. Kotter will perform the procedure tomorrow morning.
2660	J.D.'s Narration	The best thing about good friends is how quickly things like this blow over.
2661	J.D.	You understand right?
2662	Turk	Whatever man.
2663	J.D.	You want some salsa for that chip on your shoulder?
2664	Turk	I can't believe you, I would never ever do something like this to you. You're like school in July.
2665	J.D.	What do you mean like school in July?
2666	Turk	No class.
2667	Dr. Cox	You know, you're not supposed to scare me like that sir?
2668	Dr. Benson	Oh it was just a prank. Admittedly I took it too far.
2669	Dr. Cox	Well, I still laughed but like I said I feel a little guilty that I wasn't here administering-
2670	Dr. Kelso	Hi-ho I just came to check on my favorite patient. I must have the wrong room. How are ya Dave?
2671	Dr. Benson	I'm doin great Bob. I owe you one.
2672	Dr. Cox	Hey Doc, you should go ahead and get some rest.
2673	Dr. Benson	I'll be out of your hair soon enough.
2674	Dr. Kelso	Just a sec Skipper you'll stay here until you decide you're ready to leave. For God's sake you were the chief of medicine here for over ten years. Am I right?
2675	Dr. Cox	That was just exactly what I said this morning.
2676	Dr. Kelso	Yeah it sounded familiar.
2677	Dr. Cox	Huh?
2678	Dr. Kelso	What?
2679	Dr. Cox	I was just wondering how you comb your hair so the horns don't show.
2680	Dr. Kelso	I wonder what bothers you the most? Is it that I saved his life? That he likes me as a person. I bet it's how much he respects me as a doctor. How does that taste? Bitter? Hard to get down?
2681	Carla	Here you go.
2682	Elliot	Great. Carla everyone likes you so much it makes me wonder-
2683	Carla	Why all your patients think you're a cold fish?
2684	Elliot	Oh my God you noticed?
2685	Carla	No honey they told me.
2686	Elliot	Great, anyone needs me I'll be in the supply closet eating sugar packets.
2687	Carla	Look Elliot, I'm not the kind of person who likes telling people what to do but
2688	Carla to J.D.	Here's what you should do.
2689	Carla to Turk	Here's what I think.
2690	Carla to Dr. Cox	Here's what your problem is.
2691	Carla to Elliot	You have to stop thinking of your patients as strangers.
2692	Carla to J.D.	I'm dating Turk I get it, sometimes he is a big kid. But you have to realize when it comes to work he's as capable and mature as anyone.
2693	Carla to Turk	Take those out.
2694	Turk	Baby, I was bein a walrus
2695	Carla to Turk	You have to realize that J.D.'s not only your friend but he's a patient too and he's scared.
2696	Carla to Dr. Cox	Kelso is just pushing your buttons every now and then you gotta to let something go.
2697	J.D.	Turk's not that mature he spent all yesterday being a walrus. He had straws and stuff.
2698	Turk	The only thing J.D.'s scared of is sharks and he has this weird thing with pennies, but that's it. He's not not scared about this.
2699	Dr. Cox	Kelso's not just some harmless guy pushing my buttons Carla. He's a pod person.
2700	J.D.	You're wrong.
2701	Turk	You're so wrong.
2702	Dr. Cox	Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong. You're wrong, you're wrong, you're wrong.
2703	Elliot	I think you're right. I just don't know how to connect with patients.
2704	Carla	You can start by touching them. You know holding their hand or stroking their hair or giving them a reassuring pat on the arm-
2705	Elliot	What are you doing?
2706	Carla	Nothing. You're gonna be great.
2707	Elliot	Damn right!
2708	Elliot	Their, you're all set.
2709	Patient	ungh!
2710	Elliot	Ooh I'm so sorry! I didn't- I didn't
2711	Patient	Ah!
2712	Elliot	Oh I'm sorry. No, it's my watch let me get it.
2713	Patient	Ah!
2714	Elliot	Hi! Oh! I'm- I'm so sorry! Ooh let me. Ooh.
2715	Dr. Kelso	See Dave at Sacred Heart we don't treat symptoms, we treat people.
2716	Dr. Benson	Hey there's something on your back.
2717	Dr. Kelso	What does this one say?
2718	Dr. Benson	"Never stop kicking me" and on the other side is my discharge form. Uh Bob you tried to discharge me an hour before I almost died?
2719	Dr. Kelso	Well- How very clever.
2720	Dr. Cox	What? It wasn't me. In fact I think you put it there yourself to get more attention.
2721	Dr. Cox	It was me, I put it there.
2722	Turk	Hey buddy. Okay, forget about everything that's going on. We know that you're bummed out about missing Thanksgiving. So we decided to bring it to you.
2723	J.D.	Wow guys thanks. Where's the food?
2724	Janitor	Who wants the unmentionables?
2725	Carla	Bambi your fever's spiking. They're worried that your appendix might burst. So we're going into surgery now.
2726	J.D.	Who's on call tonight?
2727	Dr. Wen	Dr. Turk let's get started.
2728	J.D.'s Narration	Most doctors don't believe in the whole out of body experience thing. And I don't know if it was real or a dream but I swear I was up there watching Turk operate on me and I have to say, he's an amazing surgeon.
2729	Turk	Dude, could you not look over my shoulder while I'm doin this. It's a little unnerving.
2730	Elliot	Oh, you've got a little fever it's probably just atelectasis from laying in bed.
2731	Patient	I'm really uncomfortable.
2732	Elliot	I'm so sorry
2733	Patient	You're not gonna hug me are you?
2734	Elliot	Yeah believe me, I'm done with all that.
2735	Patient	If it'll make you feel better, I hate this whole touchy feely culture anyway.
2736	Elliot	Thank you!
2737	Patient	And that whole kiss hello thing.
2738	Elliot	Ugh
2739	Patient	Ew.
2740	Elliot	Yeah I don't want anyone touching me unless we're gonna have sex and even then I don't want them to overdo it.
2741	Patient	So where in Connecticut are you from?
2742	Elliot	Greenwich, you?
2743	Patient	Darien. I am really burning up here.
2744	Patient	Oh God that's fantastic. It's like an ice pack.
2745	Elliot	Yeah… I'm so sorry to hear about your mom. Are you at least close with your dad?
2746	Patient	See this right here? That's his work. Pretty good for a man in a wheelchair huh?
2747	Dr. Cox	Hey Doc I'm awful sorry you gotta be here on Thanksgiving night.
2748	Dr. Benson	Oh my wife can't cook anyway, she's 22. What are you doing?
2749	Dr. Cox	Forget about me what's your wife look like you don't have any pictures do ya?
2750	Dr. Benson	Not of this one.
2751	Dr. Benson	You know being back at this place
2752	Dr. Cox	Well I think I can guess.
2753	Dr. Benson	You.
2754	Dr. Cox	Oh. I-
2755	Dr. Benson	Yeah probably because you do things like show up the chief of medicine. When anybody who's been in a room with Bob Kelso for more than two minutes knows how big an ass he is.
2756	Dr. Cox	Hey go easy, I just thought-
2757	Dr. Benson	You don't think Perry, you're such a talented doctor. If you would play the game even a little you'd be in a position where you could change things around here. But you're too stubborn for that aren't ya?
2758	Dr. Benson	Alright kid. Gin, your deal.
2759	Turk	Hey, I just need to check on your incision.
2760	J.D.	Turk I was an idiot
2761	Turk	It's okay man.
2762	J.D.	No seriously man, I want you to know if I ever need surgery again I want you inside of me.
2763	Turk	I wanna be the one inside you.
2764	Turk	Look J.D. I get it. I mean to me you'll always be that geeky kid with the Pat Benatar T-Shirt on.
2765	J.D.	Dude she rocks.
2766	Turk	I just want you to know how serious I am about what I do.
2767	Turk	That's not important. You know it's still Thanksgiving for like 20 more minutes.
2768	Turk	Now you can have ginger ale and a cracker.
2769	J.D.	Ooh!
2770	Turk	Oh and I forgot, you're change… two pennies.
2771	J.D.	Get those pennies away from me!
2772	Turk	Happy Thanksgiving man.
2773	J.D.'s Narration	I guess what they say is true the people you work with really do become your family. Like your brother, and your sister in law, or that cousin you have funny feelings for,. and the crazy angry uncle everyone sort of hopes isn't coming this year.
2774	Dr. Cox	Nobody talk, just drink.
2775	J.D.'s Narration	Ah uncomfortable silences and alcohol… just like Thanksgiving at home.
2776	Dr. Cox	Drink!
2777	J.D.	Their was the Nina…
2778	Dr. Cox	Shut up!
2779	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2780	J.D.	Hey. What are you doin'?
2781	Turk	Reading a book. About how to tell my room-mate he drives me crazy sometimes without hurting his feelings.
2782	J.D.	I think sarcasm works better when it's shorter.
2783	Turk	Fascinating.
2784	J.D.	Yeah, see, there ya go.
2785	J.D.	So, what are you doin'?
2786	Turk	You realize you're annoying me?
2787	J.D.	Yeah; I'm okay with it.
2788	Turk	J.D., I've had such a crappy morning in this hell-hole that I decided to come out here and eat my lunch. This spot feels secluded I mean, it's so peaceful. I feel like I'm getting my spirit back.
2789	J.D.	It's just a bench.
2790	Turk	Sit down, sweet thing. Sit down.
2791	J.D.	Nice. You know, I've already eaten, but I suppose I could
2792	Turk	Okay, what's it gonna take for you to leave this second?
2793	J.D.	Your cupcake.
2794	J.D.	This is how I get _my_ spirit back.
2795	J.D.	Mmm-mmm! ...I feel _alive_ again! I feel alive again! Alive again! I feel alive....!
2796	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay. You know what? It's time to change this pattern.
2797	J.D.	Morning.
2798	Janitor	How do you figure?
2799	J.D.	Just doing a little drilling, huh?
2800	Janitor	Yeah.
2801	J.D.	Look, I have an idea: Let's try and go the whole day without getting in each other's hair; you know, just...give each other a break...? What do you say?
2802	Janitor	I'm gonna give you a nickname.
2803	J.D.	That that's good, but you know, I already I have a nickname; it's...it's "J.D."
2804	Janitor	How 'bout, uh...Whiny Face.... Whiny Britches! Whiny...something I definitely like "whiny."
2805	Janitor	Uh, Whiny Dancer!
2806	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2807	J.D.	Ohhh, I can't believe I went out last night.
2808	Carla	I thought you said you were exhausted?
2809	J.D.	I was, but I figured I owed it to the ladies!
2810	Carla	Do you ever stop giving?
2811	J.D.'s Narration	It's hard for doctors and nurses to be long-term friends....
2812	Carla	His O-2 set's dropping; I think he just needs respiratory treatment.
2813	J.D.'s Narration	You see, when you start out, the nurses know more than you. But after a few months, the training kicks in and you both feel the dynamic shift.
2814	J.D.	Uhhhh...actually, Carla, I think, because of the congestive heart failure, he just needs Lasix.
2815	J.D.'s Narration	The future of the relationship depends on how she handles that very moment.
2816	Carla	I'm so proud of you, Bambi.
2817	Carla	They grow up so fast!
2818	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2819	Elliot	Dr. Cox!
2820	Dr. Cox	And there you are!
2821	Elliot	Excuse me?
2822	Dr. Cox	I was just now wondering if there's anything that could actually push my headache into a full-blown migraine, and...there you are.
2823	Dr. Cox	What's the story on the admit in 64?
2824	Elliot	Oh, she's great! I really like her!
2825	Dr. Cox	Yeah, let's see if you can't focus on things that I actually give a rat's ass about.
2826	Dr. Cox	What?
2827	Elliot	She blacked out at work and presented with accelerated heartbeat and hyperventilating.
2828	Dr. Cox	Interesting.
2829	Jill	I don't care if it wasn't 'good first-date conversation' Michael deserved to know what I think about circumcising babies. I mean, over my dead body! What? ... Actually, no...no, it wasn't, which is surprising because he's Jewish.
2830	Elliot	I gave her two Valium.
2831	Jill	Okay, I'm e-mailing you as we're talking HOW COOL IS THAT!!
2832	Dr. Cox	So, she's actually sedated as we speak?
2833	Elliot	Mm-hmm!
2834	Jill	Okay, bye.
2835	Jill	Hey, Elliot! Okay, first impression: Did I scare Michael off?
2836	Elliot	No!
2837	Dr. Cox	No.... Not if he enjoys a big, fat cup-a crazy!
2838	Dr. Cox	Miss Tracey, we're all extremely busy, so if we could get down to business, that would be
2839	Elliot	Oh, my God! I have the exact same e-mailing pagey thingie!
2840	Jill	Oh, get out!
2841	Dr. Cox	Ahahaha! Oh!
2842	Jill	Oh, my God. My "H" sticks a little bit; does your "H" stick?
2843	Elliot	It does, it does, it does!
2844	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2845	Turk	Baby, it may just be a bench, but you know what? It's quiet, and I can chill. It's like my special place.
2846	Carla	You are so damn cute, I can't even _stand_ it!
2847	Turk	Serious?
2848	Carla	Yeah. I love it that my man's all deep and whatnot.
2849	Turk	You know, I get deep.
2850	Carla	I know.
2851	J.D.	Hey-hey-hey what's happenin', Rerun.
2852	Turk	What up, Raj!
2853	J.D.	Okay, how 'bout a little of this.
2854	Carla	Oh, come on, it wasn't even that good a show.
2855	J.D.	Take it back.
2856	Turk	This second.
2857	Turk	Ooh, look at the time! Gotta go it's lunch-time! See you, Baby!
2858	J.D.	Are we still on for that, uh, Bresson exhibit?
2859	Carla	Yes, we are.
2860	Turk	Oh, I'm sorry, uh...did somebody just ask out my girlfriend?
2861	J.D.	You wanna come?
2862	Carla	Oh: Black and white photography; very artsy-fartsy; no boobies.
2863	Turk	Hell, no.
2864	Turk	Hello, sir.
2865	Dr. Kelso	Nice spot.
2866	Turk	Yes, sir...it is.
2867	Dr. Kelso	I usually try to get out here for lunch every day at 12:30.
2868	Turk	You don't say....
2869	Dr. Kelso	Yep. Every day. 12:30. For twenty-three years.
2870	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2871	Janitor	Hey, from now on, your name is "Scooter."
2872	J.D.	I don't get it.
2873	Janitor	It's short for "Scooter Pie."
2874	Janitor	I hate Scooter Pies.
2875	J.D.	Oh. Now I see.
2876	J.D.'s Thoughts	You big jerk.
2877	Carla	Hey, thanks again for the invite, Bambi; I love photography.
2878	J.D.	Baby, photography is for studs.
2879	J.D.'s Narration	After working at a hospital for a while, you develop a sixth sense for danger.
2880	J.D.'s Narration	Maybe there's a mass cas. alert...maybe there's a code....
2881	J.D.'s Narration	...Maybe someone spent the morning with the most annoying patient in the world and needs to vent.
2882	J.D.'s Narration	Luckily, I was prepared.
2883	Dr. Cox	Did you do your pre-rounds?
2884	J.D.	Yes.
2885	Dr. Cox	Discharge summaries?
2886	J.D.	Yes.
2887	Dr. Cox	Pharmacy renewals?
2888	J.D.	Yes!
2889	Dr. Cox	S.O.A.P. notes?
2890	J.D.	Yes.
2891	Dr. Cox	Central line changes.
2892	J.D.	Yes.
2893	Dr. Cox	Okay, Janet. But...did you go ahead and fix your beeper so it doesn't play that annoying song every single time you get paged?
2894	J.D.	...Yes.
2895	J.D.'s Thoughts	Crap.
2896	Fantasy Sequence	Dr. Cox is a boxer, and J.D. is his punching bag.
2897	Dr. Cox	I expect you to act like a professional around here!
2898	J.D.	Is that all you got!?!
2899	J.D.	Good one!
2900	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2901	Dr. Kelso	Interesting tidbit: Back during the gold rush, when a man staked a claim, if he came upon another man panning his spot...why, he could shoot that fella dead without even asking any questions.
2902	Turk	You don't say.
2903	Dr. Kelso	Simpler times.
2904	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2905	Jill	Okay, what if you've had three great dates and he likes you so much, he hasn't even tried to have sex with you yet?
2906	Elliot	Ooh. I could sabotage that relationship in two phone calls.
2907	Jill	I could do it in one.
2908	Elliot	Jill, Sabotage That Relationship!
2909	Jill	For starters, I would ask him why he finds me so repulsive, then I would coerce him into having phone sex with me, after which I would ask him if he thinks we have a future together...and then I'd probably just cry until he hung up on me.
2910	Elliot	We are _so_ alike!
2911	Jill	I know!
2912	Dr. Cox	Oh, stop! No, you stop! Oh, dear God.
2913	Dr. Cox	Miss Tracey, we're gonna go ahead
2914	Jill	Can you just give me one sec I'm on The Zone, I'm trying to arrange to have the food delivered here.
2915	Elliot	Mm.
2916	Jill	Fatty had a party and nobody came!
2917	Elliot	Preachin' to the choir.
2918	Dr. Cox	Okay. Think of what little patience I have as...oh, I don't know...your virginity: You always thought it would be there, until that night junior year when you were feeling a little down about yourself and your pal Kevin who _just_ wanted to be friends well, he dropped by, and he brought a copy of 'About Last Night' and a four-pack of Bartles and James and ba-dow! hoo-hoo-hoo! it was gone forever! ...Just like my patience is now.
2919	Jill	So you do scary little speeches.... How adorable!
2920	Elliot	This is so much fun!
2921	Dr. Cox	Careful, Rapunzel.
2922	Elliot	Oh!
2923	Dr. Cox	Fun time is officially over.
2924	Carla	You think you can just treat Bambi like that and walk away?
2925	Jill	Get him, girlfriend!

2927	Todd	What up, T-Dog!
2928	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, the only way to avoid the high-five with Todd is not to say anything that he can connect to sex.
2929	Todd	How you doin'?
2930	Todd	Dude; that's totally how my car was rockin' when I took this girl out last night.
2931	Todd	Am I right?
2932	J.D.'s Thoughts	Ahh, he earned it.
2933	J.D.	Pain.
2934	Turk	So Cox tore into you, huh?
2935	J.D.	Yeah; you know what really pisses me off? Is that no one ever calls him on anything, you know?
2936	Carla	You wanna kick and scream while you're teaching people here, that's fine. But if you _ever_ yell at my friend again over _nothing_, then I will personally wipe that scary smile off your face, put it in my purse, and keep it there until no one around here is any more scared of you than I am.
2937	J.D.	It's not fair. Wait, why are you eating in here?
2938	Todd	T-Man's afraid of Kelso.
2939	Turk	I'm not afraid of Kelso! I just felt like eating in here.
2940	J.D.	Go outside and stand up for yourself!
2941	Turk	Hell, yeah!
2942	Todd	Dude. You know what else stands up for itself?
2943	J.D.	You know, Todd, I'm not sure, but I'm I'm gonna guess that it's your penis.
2944	Todd	It is!
2945	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, no.

2947	Dr. Cox	Everyone, we can all relax now the planets have been realigned and order shall be returned to the people.
2948	Dr. Cox	Hey. You.
2949	Elliot	Just give me two seconds, I've just gotta finish e-mailing Jill.
2950	Dr. Cox	I have, right here, your little friend's test results. Shall we have some fun and take a look?
2951	Dr. Cox	Hmm. Interesting. EKG negative. Tilt-table negative. Echo negative. Nyet, nada, zilch nothing, in fact, is wrong with her but a little stress and exhaustion brought on most likely by ohh, let it come being her!
2952	Elliot	Yeah, but if
2953	Dr. Cox	No-no, no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no, no, NO! There's no time for 'yeah...but's. I want her punted outta here in the next five minutes or you will personally be responsible for covering every missed shift during this year's flu season. Now go. Now go. Now go.
2954	Dr. Cox	Hey, you.
2955	Dr. Cox	For what it's worth, I don't care if your beeper plays "Who let the dogs out woof, woof" as many times as ya like.
2956	J.D.	Actually, sir, it's "who, who", but thank you! That that's great.
2957	Dr. Cox	Sure. Oh, and Ginger, by the way, just a real smooth move running to your mommy.
2958	J.D.	'Scuse me?
2959	Dr. Cox	Yeah, your mommy ca-rushed me. She did. Uh, I'd like to issue a warning to everybody and I'm dead serious FYI: J.D.'s mommy has made it perfectly clear that she doesn't want her daughter picked on anymore. Nothing mean! She's a precious flower, and we should all be super-nice to her!

2964	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
2965	Jill	When I get out of here, we should totally hang!
2966	Elliot	I'd love to! I should warn you, though, I work a ton, and when I'm off I usually stay at home to catch up on paperwork or read medical journals just to stay ahead of the curve. Oh, I'm a nerd.
2967	Jill	Man, I wish I could stay home and read sometimes, you know? But, my job, it's like, Mm! you know? And with the "Married by the Millennium" thing still hanging over my head, I go on, like, a thousand blind dates. And then there's all my friends who, like, always need something. And there's me, who's, like, never wants to let anyone down, you know, ever! You know, with so many balls in there air, sometimes it gets, uh, it gets a little overwhelming! As soon as I leave here, I know I'm going right back to that mess. Oh, my God, I'm practically crying. How pathetic is that!
2968	J.D.'s Narration	Around here you have to make big choices every day.
2969	Elliot	Well, actually, I I came down here to tell you that, uh, we're gonna keep you here for the weekend just to get some rest.
2970	J.D.'s Narration	To tell you the truth, most of these choices actually have nothing to do with medicine.
2971	Turk	It's so on.
2972	J.D.'s Narration	In those cases, you have to make sure that your emotions don't get the best of you.
2973	Dr. Cox	Mommy...Mommy...Mommy...Mommy.
2974	Carla	Give me that, Bambi! That's not a toy!
2975	J.D.	Look, my name is not Bambi! Okay!? It's Dr. Dorian. And I don't I don't really need to be looked after, okay?! So loo how about I'll be the doctor, and you just...you be the nurse!

2982	J.D.	Look, Carla, wait.
2983	Turk	What did you do!?!
2984	Dr. Cox	What did you do!
2985	Elliot	What did you do?
2986	J.D.	She called me "Bambi" in front of everyone. My name is not Bambi!
2987	Janitor	It's Scooter!
2988	J.D.	Ugh!
2989	Janitor	It's short for Scooter Pie.
2990	Turk	Baby, J.D. is my best friend, but, listen, if you need me to kick his ass, I will kick his ass! 'Cause I care for you.
2991	Carla	And 'cause I'm willing to sleep with you.
2992	Turk	Hell, yeah.
2993	Carla	Well, sweetie, you know if I wanted his ass kicked, I'd do it myself.
2994	Todd	Meow!
2995	Carla	Todd, if you ever make that horny cat noise at me again, I will reach into your mouth and unscrew that 7-watt bulb that barely keeps your brain open for business.
2996	Turk	Damn!
2997	Todd	Dude, chick threats are hot.
2998	Turk	What did I tell you about annoying Carla? If she makes me choose between the two of you, you know how it's gonna end up.
2999	Todd	Yes, I do. And I thank you for that.

3004	Dr. Cox	Could you possibly excuse me for just one second?

3007	J.D.'s Narration	There's nothing worse than knowing you've wronged a friend and having to just lay it all out there and apologize.
3008	J.D.	Look, Carla
3009	Carla	It's okay. You over-reacted.
3010	J.D.	Yeah, but
3011	Carla	I should have realized you can stand up for yourself.
3012	J.D.	Well, actually, I
3013	Carla	Sweetie, I know you would take it back if you could; I do! We're okay, right?
3014	J.D.	I think I've said all I can.

3019	Elliot	For what?
3020	Dr. Cox	Hello, sad clown. Thanks for paging her.
3021	Elliot	How could you?
3022	Jill	He he called me "Cutie" and then he said something about my eyes...being as blue as the ocean I...I got confused.
3023	Elliot	Yeah, it probably woulda worked on me, too.
3024	Dr. Cox	You're damn right it would've. Come.

3030	Dr. Kelso	Consider that your last supper; I'm bored with the games.
3031	Turk	Are...you forbidding me to sit here?
3032	Dr. Kelso	This is a public bench; you are as welcome here as I am. But you won't come back again, you know why? Because you just don't have the mettle. Now get the hell out of here so I can eat my wife's egg salad sandwich before the tomato soaks through the bread!

3036	Carla	No; actually, I never went to college.
3037	J.D.	Ah. Don't tell any of my patients, but neither did I.
3038	Carla	What, is that supposed to make me feel better or something?
3039	J.D.	What? No, no, that's just it's just a joke. I'm doing the whole, like, "Turn that frown upside-down...."
3040	Carla	Yeah, you know what? Hold it! I don't think we're okay.
3041	J.D.	Wait! You just accepted my apology. You can't take it back!
3042	Carla	Have you _ever_ spent time with a woman?!
3043	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3044	Elliot	Is my punishment still coming, or is it just the horrible staring? Because the anticipation is killing me.
3045	Dr. Cox	Make your case.
3046	Elliot	Uh, I'm sorry, what?
3047	Dr. Cox	Well, you tell me why Chorey McCrazy Chore should get to stay here two more nights.
3048	Elliot	Okay.... You don't understand how hard it is for some women to make it on their own nowadays. I mean, Jill is _so_ exhausted, and it's not gonna get any easier because she's her own worst enemy, you know? I mean, she's constantly trying to please everyone! She judges herself harsher than anyone does.
3049	Dr. Cox	Have you actually seen what _you_ look like today?
3050	Elliot	I know: I'm a skank! And she never says no to anyone, so
3051	Dr. Cox	Could you swing by my apartment after work, pick up a sample of my dog's stool, then take it to the vet for me?
3052	Elliot	I can do it at lunch.
3053	Elliot	Oh....
3054	Dr. Cox	It's okay. Jill can stay a little longer. And if we're real lucky, she'll realize that it's okay to give yourself a break every once in a while. Right?
3055	Elliot	Yeah....

3057	J.D.	Hey, I I took a cab from the last stop you forgot your coat.
3058	Carla	I don't want it.
3059	J.D.	Why would you?
3060	Carla	You know I was only gonna go to that stupid exhibit because I wanted you to think I was brainy or something. I'm so angry at myself.
3061	J.D.	Oh, thank goodness; 'cause I thought you were mad at me.
3062	Carla	I've had hundreds of interns decide that they don't need me anymore. Why should You see, this is why you can't be friends with doctors.
3063	J.D.	Look, Carla, if it's a problem, then you, me, and Elliot and Turk, we'll get together and
3064	Carla	I don't work with Turk! And I'm not that close to Elliot. The only problem here is _you_, okay? We're supposed to be friends. Your self-esteem is so wrapped up in what you do. You're a doctor that's all you are, that's how you define yourself. And you think that you're better than me because of it.
3065	J.D.	Carla, I do not think
3066	Carla	Admit it. Admit it right now, or I'll never respect you again.
3067	J.D.	Okay, sometimes that's true.
3068	J.D.	Carla, you're a good nurse.
3069	Carla	I'm a _great_ nurse; you patronizing ass.
3070	Carla	You don't even get it, do you? For nine years, I never once felt bad about myself for what I do not for one second. And then I met you.
3071	J.D.	Please wait.
3072	Carla	Don't!
3073	Cut to	The Hospital
3074	J.D.	Hey.
3075	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes the only way to take a really good look at yourself is through someone else's eyes. If you're lucky, you'll like what you see.
3076	Dr. Kelso	Impressive.
3077	J.D.'s Narration	Or you'll learn from it.
3078	J.D.'s Narration	If you don't like what you see, I guess all you can do is hope that you haven't burned too many bridges.
3079	J.D.	Hey, Carla, how many M.A.Q.s of potassium should I give this guy?
3080	Carla	You know the answer to that; don't do that. But thanks, Bambi.
3081	J.D.'s Narration	From that moment on, I knew I'd be "Bambi" forever.
3082	Dr. Cox	See you tomorrow, Scooter.

3086	J.D.'s Narration	Ahh, Christmas Eve. Unfortunately, when you spend every waking moment in a hospital, it's kinda hard to get into the spirit.
3087	Nurse Roberts	Are you aware that you are in everyone's way?
3088	J.D.	Everyone's way? Or _your_ way? Think about it.
3089	J.D.	Thank God.
3090	J.D.'s Thoughts	Still, there are some traditions I enjoy. Like Nurse Tisdale's 9:15 cup-a coffee.
3091	Elliot	Carla, what time is it?
3092	Carla	Ohh, I don't know, but I'm guessing it's about hmm 9:15ish?
3093	J.D.	Oh , this thing?
3094	J.D.	Who put this up!?
3095	Janitor	I did. I drove around the whole city before my 5 a.m. shift just...looking for that trying to add a little cheer. You will not ruin my Christmas. Not again. Not this year.
3096	J.D.	But I've only worked here for three months.
3097	J.D.'s Thoughts	Things could be worse, I could be with Elliot, doing my mandatory day in the free clinic.
3098	Elliot	I understand that you took a cab all the way down here that doesn't mean that I can give you Vicodin because your teeth are itchy.
3099	Elliot	Dr. Kelso!
3100	Dr. Kelso	You know, I don't want to sound insensitive, but why don't these people have any money?
3101	Elliot	Uh...I I don't know, sir. They probably waste it all on...food.
3102	Elliot	Dr. Kelso, I need to present a patient: Nineteen-year-old complaining of abdominal pain turns out she's at least eight months pregnant. I'm just gonna let one of the Family Practice people handle it.
3103	Dr. Kelso	Well, that sounds like a wonderful idea, sweetheart; except I heard your smart-alleck remark a second ago, so why don't you just keep your little pregnant girl. It'll be good practice for you, since you'll probably end up in a female specialty, anyway.
3104	Elliot	What do you mean by that? I'm Internal Medicine.
3105	Dr. Kelso	Well, of course you are. But numbers don't lie, and most women end up in ON-GYN, Family Practice, or Pediatrics. It's like a rip-tide, sweetheart pulling and pulling, and you can swim against the current all you want; but when Mr. Stork comes a-calling, you're not gonna be thinking, "I'm Internal Medicine" nope. It's gonna be, "Ohhhh, look at the baby!"
3106	Elliot	Sir. I have to say, I'm offended!

3110	J.D.	None! It's like this when I wake up.
3111	Dr. Cox	Yeah. Quick tip, there, sports-star when you're defensive about your feminine side, it just makes you seem more girly.
3112	J.D.	I assume you want something.
3113	Dr. Cox	Easy; nobody likes a cranky punching bag. And yes, it's about a patient pretty good friend of mine, actually.
3114	J.D.'s Thoughts	Wow. I guess that means he respects me a little.
3115	J.D.	Huh!
3116	Dr. Cox	Hey, Randy, Jackie, whatta ya say? This is the monkey I got to videotape the birth.
3117	J.D.'s Thoughts	I hate him.
3118	J.D.'s Thoughts	....but not as much as moments like these. There's nothing I can do for that guy, and yet, when I go in there, the whole family's gonna look at me like I got some magical power to fix him.
3119	Patient	Hey, everybody!
3120	J.D.	Heyyy.
3121	J.D.	I'm sorry, but it's been two weeks and your son shows no neurological improvement.
3122	Turk	It was a miracle! First of all, the man was damn-near dead; then he comes out!
3123	J.D.	Oh, you're ridiculous.
3124	Turk	He was damn-near J.D., I'm telling you, it was a miracle!
3125	J.D.	It was not a miracle!
3126	Turk	Yes it _was_ a miracle! Dude!
3127	J.D.'s Narration	I kind of envy Turk to be that sure of something, to have that faith of course, that doesn't mean I don't love busting him about it.
3128	J.D.	Okay; so you think _God_ was responsible for his recovery?
3129	Turk	Mm-hmm!
3130	J.D.	That's fine; we all have our beliefs. I, for instance, carry around this tiny little Monopoly piece for good luck.
3131	Turk	Did you just compare my Lord and Savior to a tiny top-hat?
3132	Carla	He did, I heard him, Baby. Go get him.
3133	J.D.	Oh, excuse me, Nurse Theresa, have _you_ ever read the Bible?
3134	Carla	I started it...but then I skipped to the end and it ruined it for me.
3135	Turk	That's it the both of you to the window. Let's go.
3136	Carla	I'm goin'!
3137	Turk	Right now.
3138	Turk	See, when they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. Matthew...2:10.
3139	J.D.	Dude, that's just the big Christmas tree in Miller Park.
3140	Carla	I understand what you're saying, Baby.
3141	Turk	Oh, no, no; please. You can't just jump back on my good side. You see all of this right here? And this? And this? Consider yourself cut off full love embargo, Baby.
3142	Carla	Baby, that's not gonna last.
3143	Turk	It will last.
3144	Carla	Oh, yeah?
3145	Turk	It's gonna last.
3146	Carla	What if I came up to you all tired, you know, and I just... I had to yawn...?

3153	Meredith	What? That's not possible. What am I supposed to do?
3154	Dr. Kelso	Ohhh, look at the baby!

3159	J.D.	It's selfish, is what it is.
3160	Jordan	I thought I got Randy and Jackie in the divorce.
3161	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, God, his ex-wife. The tension actually hurts. You have to break it; say something, anything!
3162	J.D.	Banana hammock!
3163	Dr. Cox	I'm betting your ability to thrive under pressure is what drove you to medicine.
3164	Jordan	Oh, please, you should've seen him when he was a new intern: "I don't want to be a doctor!"
3165	J.D.	You know, I think we all know that's just not true.
3166	Dr. Cox	I'm assuming, since you already went ahead and took everything else, that you're here for my self respect but there's bad news on that one, sweet-cheeks: I already gave it to your mom when she begged me to marry ya!
3167	Jordan	Oh, I wouldn't have room for it, anyway, what with your testicles in my trophy case.

3176	J.D.'s Narration	One thing about Turk: He's always been good at rallying people.

3178	Congregation	Amen!
3179	Reverend Turk	'Tis the season of giving, y'all!

3181	Reverend Turk	"Lovest thou Me...then feed my sheep."
3182	Reverend Turk	But right here, at Sacred Heart, we are not only gonna feed His sheep but we gonna clothe them.
3183	Reverend Turk	And we gonna bathe them!
3184	Reverend Turk	And we gonna cut 'em open.... And then we gonna stitch 'em right back together!

3201	Narrator	Congratulations! You're expecting! Don't worry your doctor will tell you everything you need to know.
3202	Narrator	Hi, Doctor!
3203	J.D.	You'll fart, pee, puke, and poop in front of ten complete strangers who'll be staring intently at your vagina which, by the way, has an eighty percent chance of tearing!

3211	Elliot	Hello, I just got Meredith Fox's blood-work back and she's got HELLP Syndrome she needs to deliver immediately, so let's get her in a room and What do you mean she just left? Get me any contact numbers.
3212	Elliot	Why'd she leave?
3213	Orderly	Again: Bed-maker.
3214	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3215	Dr. Cox	Newbie, I always punch the tabs out of my tapes so there's no possible way they can be recorded over. So, puh-lease tell me you didn't use the tape that was already in the camera.
3216	J.D.	Banana hammock.
3217	Dr. Cox	So, in other words, there is no permanent historical record of the birth of my friends' baby.
3218	J.D.	Well... I think that the baby, itself, would serve as proof that it was...you know...born.
3219	Dr. Cox	You don't understand what you've done. My ex-wife is probably gonna hold this over my head for so long that I doubt I'll ever see the sun again. And I like the sun, Newbie; it made me hopeful.
3220	J.D.	Well, I was there; you know, I could certainly jot down some of my feelings and...impressions.
3221	J.D.'s Thoughts	You know, if he was really mad at me, he would've stayed and yelled at me.
3222	Dr. Cox	Don't kid yourself, Newbie I couldn't _be_any madder at you!
3223	Dr. Cox	Oh! Ah! Do _not_ do that again! That's a bad newbie! Oh, bad! Oh, bad!
3224	Dr. Cox	Bad!
3225	Dr. Cox	Ah! Oh! Oh! Oh! Bad newbie!
3226	J.D.'s Thoughts	At least I can go home now.
3227	J.D.'s Narration	You see, maybe it's because Christmas is a hard time for people, maybe it's because too many families get together, but, statistically, Christmas Eve it's one of the worst nights of the year to be on-call.
3228	J.D.	I can't believe I'm wearing a suit at 6:30 in the morning.
3229	Carla	If you ruin this for Turk, I'll have to hurt you.
3230	J.D.	Noted.
3231	Carla	Hey! You better hurry up mass start s in fifteen minutes.
3232	Turk	I'm not going.
3233	J.D.	Great! Can I go back to bed?
3234	J.D.	I'm kidding! Let's do it I wanna get me some of them church crackers.
3235	Turk	No, I'm not going ever.
3236	Carla	Baby? What happened? Turk? Turk, come on.
3237	J.D.'s Thoughts	Merry Christmas.
3238	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3239	Re-open	Nurses' Station
3240	J.D.	I think you're over-reacting.
3241	Elliot	A young pregnant girl said, "What am I gonna do," and I said, "Oh, babies aren't my thing"! How could I possibly be too hard on myself?
3242	J.D.'s Thoughts	Just don't say "banana hammock."
3243	J.D.	Look, I'm sure she'll turn up.
3244	Turk	Yeah, that's exactly what's gonna happen: She'll definitely turn up, she'll have a healthy baby, and nothing'll ever happen to either one of 'em.
3245	J.D.'s Narration	I never really thought of faith as important; but without his, I don't know, Turk kinda seems like he's fading away.
3246	J.D.'s Narration	Me, I could use a little faith. I have to tell the Wheelers I didn't tape a thing.
3247	Jordan	You made some interesting choices with the camera, Orson you didn't want to see any faces?
3248	J.D.	Excuse me?
3249	Dr. Cox	I switched the tapes, just go with it.
3250	Randy	Here he comes! I see the head!
3251	Jordan	Oh, what a gorgeous head of hair!
3252	Jackie	That's funny he was completely bald when he was in here a few minutes ago.
3253	Dr. Cox	Yeah, well....
3254	J.D.	We shaved the baby.
3255	Jordan	You shaved the baby?
3256	J.D.	Shaved it....
3257	Dr. Cox	Well, it's standard procedure, what with the recent outbreak of pre-natal lice.
3258	J.D.	Yep; definitely. Shave and a hair-cut...two bits.
3259	Jordan	Really?
3260	Fantasy Sequence	A Gift Shop
3261	Jordan	Yeah, I'm not buying it.
3262	Jackie	And you two are gonna go by the nursery and see Baby Charlie, right?
3263	Dr. Cox	Absolutely.
3264	Jordan	Yes! Charlie and his new hair-cut!
3265	&	Ohh!

3267	Elliot	Have we checked all the other hospitals?
3268	Nurse Roberts	They haven't seen her, honey.
3269	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Reid? Isn't this your day off?
3270	Elliot	Actually, it's that pregnant girl I was telling you about.
3271	Dr. Kelso	Oh, right! The one who went missing. And now you're here, voluntarily, hell-bent on finding one of your little lost ducklings.
3272	Elliot	Dr. Kelso, I think it's important you understand something: I'm not interested in babies I don't coo when I'm around them, I don't melt when I see them, I don't have some yearning to make them my life's work I'm a doctor who's interested in my patients male or female and right now one of them needs help.
3273	Dr. Kelso	God! Do I know women.
3274	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3275	Turk	I don't get it. Why are we on the roof?
3276	Carla	I just wanted to show you that, no matter how ugly things can get down there, there's still a lot of beauty up here.
3277	Turk	Is that gum...or pigeon crap on my sneaker?
3278	Carla	Come on, look around! There's nobody here...no one can see us...we could do whatever we wanted....
3279	Turk	Like what?
3280	Carla	Okay, how are you not getting this?
3281	Turk	Oh, you you mean, have relations. You wanna have relations right here on the roof.
3282	Carla	Mm-huh.
3283	Turk	Baby, there's a lot of pebbles on the ground; it'll make my ass look like a chocolate-chocolate chip.
3284	Carla	I can make you see God again or at least call out his name.
3285	Turk	Is this a joke to you!?
3286	Carla	No. I'm I'm just trying to help you feel better.
3287	Turk	Baby, you don't know how I feel!
3288	Carla	Well, then, tell me!
3289	Turk	I feel abandoned! All my life, I believed that God listens to our prayers, and that He cares for us, and that He watches over us. And last night, there were so many people that needed to be watched over. How am I supposed to believe in someone that is willing to let innocent people suffer? Huh? Answer me. Please!
3290	Carla	I can't.
3291	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3292	J.D.	Did you go see Baby Charlie yet?
3293	Dr. Cox	Oh, yeah, I was actually just planning on doing that...never.
3294	J.D.	You're such a special friend.
3295	Dr. Cox	Well, gosh, Marjorie, aren't you sassy today! Did Santa finally bring you the Y chromosome you always wanted?
3296	J.D.	What's your problem, anyway?
3297	Dr. Cox	Well, for starters, I hate Christmas.
3298	Dr. Cox	I don't like Bambasnoodles; I loathe dinkowallows; I _hate_ stagtomgoppers. I say, do you follow?
3299	Jordan	Do you think I'm a moron?
3300	Dr. Cox	Newbie!! Don't answer that question! It's a trick, that's a trick!
3301	Jordan	Oh, pre-natal lice? You do realize that would be lice _in the womb_!
3302	Dr. Cox	Oh, I've seen 'em; they're real. And they're gross.
3303	J.D.'s Narration	Maybe Dr. Cox has pushed me too far, I don't know; whatever it was, I told on him.
3304	J.D.	Plus, he didn't even go see Baby Charlie yet.
3305	J.D.'s Narration	And then something amazing happened they connected. And all the hatred they had for each other was suddenly focused on me!
3306	Jordan	Excuse me, Sally Sensitive, I don't remember asking you anything. Your mom's aware that she'll eventually have to stop the breast-feeding, right?
3307	Dr. Cox	Hoo! Good, Jordan, good! Now work the body, work the body! Under the ribs! Under the ribs!
3308	Jordan	I'm not gonna see that baby, either. Are you gonna tattle on me? Are ya? Are ya?
3309	Jordan	I'm frightened!
3310	Elliot	J.D., do you have a second?
3311	J.D.	Oh, God, yes.
3312	Jordan	That's right run away, Sally.
3313	Elliot	I talked to a 9-1-1 operator who got a call from this young girl who was in labor, but they lost the signal. I don't know what to do.
3314	J.D.'s Narration	One of the worst things about this place is how often you feel like there's no one to turn to.
3315	Turk	You're okay, okay? You're gonna be okay.
3316	J.D.'s Narration	Babies are amazing. Especially the way they bring people together.
3317	Dr. Cox	So, Baby Charlie is the bald one?
3318	Jordan	Yeah. He wouldn't be smiling so much if he knew how ugly his parents were.
3319	Dr. Cox	You're a sexy bitch.
3320	Jordan	Thanks.
3321	J.D.'s Narration	I really think it's impossible to be unaffected.
3322	Turk	What up, little dawg!
3323	J.D.'s Narration	Because a baby can stir something deep down inside you you didn't even know was there.
3324	Elliot	Aw! Look at the baby!
3325	J.D.'s Narration	They can help you find something you thought you'd lost.
3326	Carla	How did you know she was here?
3327	Turk	I don't know I just knew!
3328	J.D.'s Narration	So, I guess Turk was right after all: Miracles do happen.
3329	J.D.'s Narration	I think you just have to be willing to look for them.
3330	Turk	Merry Christmas, guys.
3331	J.D.	God bless us, every one.
3332	Turk	Dude, you could not be a bigger dork.
3333	Elliot	You're so lame.
3334	Carla	That was so cheesy.
3335	J.D.	Really? 'Cause I felt like it was it was right?

3341	J.D.'s Thoughts	Crap.
3342	J.D.	Well, shouldn't there be some sort of sign that say
3343	J.D.	...Oh. Look at that. Well, you should put it back down before someone slips and falls.
3344	Janitor	Oh, is that what I should do. Good. Because I make most of my decisions based on your opinion.
3345	Janitor	You know what, I'm thinking of splitting up with the wife maybe you could mull that one over, get back to me? We can powwow?

3349	Elliot	"Q-Tip"! 'Cause you're skinny and your head's fuzzy.
3350	J.D.	Something's going down.
3351	Dr. Cox	All right, bring it in here, you knuckle-heads. Come on, take a knee if you need to, you confound-its. I have been on since midnight so I stand here with my usual level of contempt for all of you, but with the added wrinkle of having thirteen cups of Nurse Roberts' piss-poor excuse for coffee passing pretty much straight through me. The not-so-hidden message being, of course, that if you screw up today, HA! I'm gonna hit ya hard! and HA! I'm gonna hit ya fast! Now then, I think some of you may have noticed that all twenty-seven of the patients that were here in the I.C.U. when I started last night are still alive; and I damn-sure intend for them to still be breathing when I get the hell out of here at midnight. I think you understand what kind of opportunity we have in front of us.
3352	Elliot	What opportunity?
3353	Doug	No; shush, shush.
3354	J.D.	Shut up!
3355	J.D.	You see, in baseball, when a pitcher's really hot no one talks to him, no one looks at him, you just stay out of his way!
3356	Elliot	Why are you talking about baseball?
3357	Dr. Cox	Because you should never, _ever_ jinx a pitcher when he has a chance to throw a perfect game! My GOD, Barbie, how do you put your bra and panties on in the morning?! All by yourself! It's...remarkable!
3358	J.D.	See, 'cause he's the pitcher
3359	Elliot	Yeah, I get it now!

3361	Re-open	I.C.U.
3362	J.D.'s Thoughts	Getting a chance to be a part of a perfect game is like a once in a lifetime opportunity it just never happens.
3363	J.D.'s Thoughts	Which is why I don't mind Dr. Cox paging me for the thirteenth time this last hour.
3364	J.D.'s Narration	You see, the I.C.U. is where all the most critical cases get turfed. So many patients die here, you start to think of death as just another co-worker always looking over your shoulder with the same annoying demands as every one else you work with.
3365	Death	DR. DORIAN. Listen, I know you're busy, but my daughter's selling cookies.
3366	J.D.	Put me down for two boxes of those mint thingies.
3367	Death	She's in second place in her troop; 'course, if that girl who's in first keeps doing as well as she's doing, we're just gonna take her!
3368	Dr. Cox	What, exactly, do you think you're gonna do, cash it in? In your face!
3369	Dr. Cox	You're fine; thank you. Barbie!
3370	Elliot	Whatever you need, Dr. Cox, I'm your girl!
3371	Dr. Cox	Peachy. Now get down to the pharmacy and get me thirty grams of Kayexalate and don't dilly-dally around trying to refill your prescription of Prozac, you're on my time now. Go, go, go.
3372	Dr. Cox	Nervous guy.
3373	Doug	Yessir!
3374	Nurse	Excuse me!
3375	Dr. Cox	Go down to Bed 18 and get me his tox-screen; and you better cross your fingers that the news is good, because if it's not I'm blaming you.
3376	Dr. Cox	And Newbie: I want you to start a drain on the purulent pericarditis in Bed 23 now that's a tricky bastard, he's tried to die five times on me already today. Keep an eye on him.
3377	J.D.	I'm your wing man, Maverick!
3378	J.D.	I was watching, uh, 'Top Gun'. Did you know that Goose is actually the guy from 'E.R.'?
3379	Dr. Cox	No, I didn't! But but, please, keep talking!
3380	J.D.'s Narration	You really do have to keep an eye on things around here, 'cause just when it seems like everything's going great....
3381	J.D.'s Narration	...that's when the tiniest thing can throw it all out of whack.
3382	Turk	What are you doing? When the lunch-lady asked "French fries," you said no.
3383	Carla	Yeah...but I wanted french fries.
3384	Turk	So why didn't you _order_ fries?
3385	Carla	'Cause I can't _have_ french fries. Duh!
3386	Turk	Here. Have 'em all.
3387	Carla	Wha ?
3388	Turk	Have a fry salad.
3389	Carla	Tu what the? Turk? Baby, come on!

3394	Dr. Kelso	Well, that's just fine, then, kiddo. I'm not going to be able to make the board meeting today I'm going to be tied up all afternoon at Dr. Dorian's pity party. Should I bring something? Maybe I could rent you a clown.
3395	J.D.	A drunk clown hurt me once.
3396	Dr. Kelso	Just listen to the damn lawyer. Go, Tom.
3397	Lawyer	Uh, it's Ted, but hey, it's only been twelve years. This morning, one of the social workers that covers this hospital slipped and knocked herself unconscious; we're concerned she might turn around and sue us. If that happens, some of the higher-ups' heads could roll!
3398	Dr. Kelso	The point is that people are less likely to sue an institution if we can put a friendly face on it. You've got a friendly face.
3399	J.D.	But, sir, I
3400	Dr. Kelso	Sacred Heart is calling for your help, sport. Will you accept the call? 'Berring!'
3401	Lawyer	Oh! Uh... 'Ber' uh 'berring'.
3402	Dr. Kelso	By the way, this is a special phone if you don't answer it, you get to be the intern who does the physicals over at the state prison!

3413	Carla	So...what'd you do?
3414	Mike	Well, some ow! some random woman just pushed me off the bus; it was totally unprovoked.
3415	Carla	Mr. Davis....

3422	Turk	Cross-covering the day for a buddy of mine, I know
3423	Carla	Whatever. Thirty-six-year-old male, possible dislocated shoulder.
3424	Turk	All right. So, how are you doing?

3431	Dr. Cox	I'll tell you what: Second chance you go get the results of Mr. Churbin's unrinalysis; but if the numbers aren't good, I'm gonna take one of your kidneys and give it to him.
3432	Dr. Cox	Ten bucks says I can make that kid wet himself before the day is over.
3433	Nurse Roberts	Oh, everybody's afraid of Mr. Man!
3434	Dr. Cox	Laverne, you give good sass!
3435	Elliot	Dr. Cox! I got the Kayexalate _and_ I pulled all the x-rays you asked for, so I am yours for the night do whatever you want with me. Oh! My God! Um, that totally came out wrong! I just I meant that I want you to use me, and I don't care how degrading it is.
3436	Dr. Cox	What?
3437	Elliot	No...no! No, it's just that I know you like torturing people, and I am totally up for that. I just want to make you happy!
3438	Nurse Roberts	Marshmallow, hush.
3439	Dr. Cox	This guy needs a lumbar puncture, and I need an extra set of hands. Get over here.

3448	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Dorian, I owe you an apology. Obviously I was unclear when I said, "Stay in the M.R.I. room with that patient." It must have sounded like, "Leave, and do other things."
3449	Dr. Kelso	Let me rephrase it so there'll be no more confusion: Get your ass back down there!
3450	Alex	You have no idea how loud that is in here!
3451	J.D.	Oh, I'm sorry. The good news is you'll be done in a second.
3452	Alex	Was that a good sound?!
3453	J.D.	Not that good a sound.
3454	Alex	Oh, my God! Is it stuck!?
3455	J.D.	Well, stuck is such a literal term. It's more like, not moving.
3456	Alex	Well, pull me the hell out of here!
3457	J.D.	I can't; you were knocked unconscious, you could have a serious head injury. Just be glad you're not claustrophobic.
3458	Alex	Promise you won't leave me.
3459	J.D.	I promise.
3460	J.D.	Dr. Cox must have my pager on speed dial. He's completely on top of me today.
3461	Elliot	Oh, do you know how much I wish Dr. Cox was on top of me?
3462	J.D.	That's naughty!
3463	Elliot	You make me so mad, I might actually scream! Every day you bitch and you bitch about how hard Dr. Cox is on you, and you don't even realize that you're his go-to guy.
3464	J.D.	Oh, come on, you're over-reacting a little bit.
3465	Elliot	What has he had you do today? Hm?
3466	J.D.	Ummm.... He had me intubate and extubate Mrs. Pollard; float a Swan on Mr. Caulca; and then do two thoracenteses, a paracentesis, a radial art. line...oh, and then place a transvenous pacemaker for a complete heart-block. Why? What did you do?
3467	Elliot	Oh, uh....
3468	Elliot	Cream. No sugar.
3469	J.D.	He takes it sugar, no cream.

3475	Carla	Oh, be nice. He's my boyfriend.
3476	Mike	Not for long.
3477	Carla	Excuse me?
3478	Mike	Please! He's been dying to run out of here since the second he came in.
3479	Carla	Oh, he did not _run_ out of here.
3480	Mike	Oh, okay, I'm sorry, you're right it wasn't running, it was, uh, fleeing, like he was being chased by a swarm of killer bees.

3504	J.D.'s Narration	Sure, I was probably thinking a little bit about the M.R.I. girl, but I also like to believe that, perfect game or not, giving a friend the chance to shine was just as important to me.
3505	J.D.	Sir, it's, uh, Dr. Kelso he's making me baby-sit this patient downstairs.

3507	Dr. Cox	Oh, no.
3508	Elliot	What?
3509	Unseen Umpire	Play ball!
3510	Elliot	Come on, baby, right here! Bring it in!

3512	Re-open	I.C.U.
3513	Elliot	Look, Dr. Cox, you can trust me to help you. For gosh sakes, I was top five in my class!
3514	Dr. Cox	Enggghhh! That's the noise I make when somebody lies to me.
3515	Elliot	Okay! I was eighth but I can do this! I'll get us this perfect
3516	Dr. Cox	Don't say it!
3517	Elliot	...The perfect game!
3518	Dr. Cox	No, don't say ! What part of "don't say it" did you not understand? Was is the "don't"? Or was it the "say it"? Help me to help you, Barbie. Help me to help you; help me to help you; help me to help you.
3519	Elliot	I, um...should get to work.
3520	Dr. Cox	That would be lovely.
3521	Elliot	Mm-hmm.
3522	Dr. Cox	Wow!
3523	J.D.	Hey, Elliot, do you
3524	Elliot	No time!
3525	J.D.'s Thoughts	We all have important things to do.
3526	J.D.	Hey, do you know what Alex Hanson looks like?
3527	Doug	He's okay.
3528	Nurse Roberts	I don't know. I don't look at the ladies.
3529	Dr. Kelso	Young man, I've been married for over three decades. I would've gone there, though; oh, yes, I would've.
3530	Janitor	Who cares? No one'll ever love you.
3531	Lawyer	I don't find her pretty; but since my wife left, when I look at a woman, I find it hard to see past the evil. Heh.
3532	Carla	I know something's wrong.
3533	Turk	Nothing's wrong.
3534	Carla	You always say nothing's wrong, then you sulk for a week and then you finally tell me.
3535	Turk	First of all, we haven't known each other long enough for me to "always" be doing anything.
3536	Mike	Well, I've only known you for ten minutes, and you're always hurting me.
3537	Carla	Oh, so now you're getting defensive?
3538	Turk	Woman, I am _not_ defensive.
3539	Mike	Yeah, y'are, a little bit.
3540	Carla	Turk, we're stuck here, why don't you just take a deep breath and tell me what's wrong?
3541	Mike	OW! That did it!
3542	Turk	Well, I guess we're done here.

3544	Dr. Cox	Barbie, plates are wobbling everywhere.
3545	Elliot	His H & H dropped three grams, so I'm starting pressers.
3546	Dr. Cox	Or, you could transfuse him.
3547	Elliot	Okay, I'll do that.
3548	Dr. Cox	Although, transfusions are riskier.
3549	Elliot	Which is why my first instinct was to do pressers.
3550	Dr. Cox	You know what they say about your first instincts.
3551	Elliot	Yeah: You should always stick with them. Shouldn't you?
3552	Dr. Cox	Should you?
3553	Elliot	Should I?
3554	Dr. Cox	"Should I?" You'll have plenty of time to think about it on the bench, because that's where you're headed. Now go. Gimme this, precious. Get outta here. Go ahead. Go, go.
3555	Dr. Cox	Hippity-hop to the barber shop.

3558	Carla	You want to know what she looks like...did she ask what you look like?
3559	J.D.	No, she can tell I'm handsome I have a husky voice: "Hellllooo, baby!"
3560	Carla	Well, why don't you look into your heart and see how it feels?
3561	J.D.	My heart hates uggos.
3562	Carla	You know what, that's exactly what's wrong with you men. You're all so superficial, so afraid of what you really feel. I'm so sick of it!
3563	J.D.	So, do you know what she looks like?
3564	Carla	Yeah, I do. But I ain't telling you.
3565	J.D.	Ohh.... Come on, just tell me, does she look anything like Jimmie Walker?

3567	Lawyer	You know, I'm noticing that the bottoms of your slippers are rather slick perhaps they contributed in some way to the incident this morning.
3568	Dr. Kelso	Those are hospital booties, you moron!
3569	Lawyer	And now I'm a moron.
3570	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Dorian! Why don't you take Miss Hanson out for a lovely dinner?
3571	Alex	Dr. Kelso, I'm not suing the hospital.
3572	Dr. Kelso	Oh!
3573	Alex	It turns out I only have a mild concussion, and plus, I work here and that's
3574	J.D.	Uhh, Alex, he's gone.
3575	Alex	Oh. So, what, uh, restaurant are you taking me to?
3576	J.D.'s Thoughts	You know, you're not a bad guy if you wanna wait and see what she looks like.
3577	Alex	I'm kidding! You don't have to take me out to dinner.
3578	J.D.	Ohhh....ohh....are you sure? 'Cause....okay.
3579	J.D.	Ah! I gotta go. Sorry.
3580	Alex	Hey, yeah, yeah, don't sweat it I mean, we'll see each other around. J.D., listen, I'm really glad that you were
3581	Lawyer	Miss Hanson, he's gone.
3582	Alex	Oh.
3583	Lawyer	You know, if I were in your slippers, I'd sue this hospital for all it's worth.
3584	Alex	Really?
3585	Lawyer	We could run away together.

3587	J.D.	Come on, dude, you know what to do: You just gotta be straight with Carla, no matter how hard it is.
3588	Turk	I hate this part.
3589	Elliot	I just don't know what to do about Dr. Cox!
3590	J.D.	What the hell is going on, here?
3591	Elliot	It's like, I say one thing, he says the other. I seriously can't take it anymore.
3592	J.D.	Fine, why don't you just quit, become a lesbian, and hook up with some hot model?
3593	Elliot	What does that have to do with anything?
3594	J.D.	I don't know...I just thought it'd be hot. Elliot, he's testing you. If you ever want Cox to respect you, you can't be afraid to disagree with him.
3595	Elliot	You're afraid.
3596	J.D.	But I still do it. Get back in the game, Elliot.
3597	Five For Fighting's "Easy Tonight" montage	Elliot and Dr. Cox slave hard all night to attain the perfect game.
3598	Dr. Cox	Ah! Dammit!
3599	Dr. Cox	Dammit! Dammit! So close! DAMMIT!
3600	Dr. Cox	I'm sorry. I'm fine.
3601	Dr. Cox	Perfect game! ...Call it.
3602	Elliot	Just five minutes left, and it's just the two of us here! Couldn't we just...wait?
3603	Dr. Cox	Just...call it.
3604	Elliot	No. We all need this, so no. I won't call it.
3605	Dr. Cox	You know, that's probably the dumbest thing anybody's said to me around here in a long time. There's nothing wrong with a one-hitter, there, Barbie. In fact, it's miraculous. And I won't have you of all people cheapen what should be an endless pursuit of perfection just because you want the world to laugh with you tonight. Now, call it.
3606	Elliot	Time of death: 11:55.

3610	Carla	I'm gonna go crash at my place tonight, like you said!

3612	Carla	God, you're so sexy right now.
3613	Turk	I've been doing a lot of thinking, and, you know...we're past that whole new, exciting relationship phase, and...all that's left is us. Baby, I gotta tell you: You drive me crazy. All right? You take my french fries; you you boss me around in front of my friends
3614	Carla	You said strong women turn you on!
3615	Turk	Forget about it.
3616	Carla	Look, we all know what you're gonna do, so why not be a man and do it so I can go home?
3617	Turk	Okay.
3618	Turk	I love you. You annoy me more than I ever thought possible, but...I want to spend every irritating minute with you.
3619	Carla	Me too.
3620	Turk	Yeah.
3621	Carla	I love you.
3622	Turk	Hey, I don't get it, though; why are you doing this to me? All I wanted to do was have sex with a foxy nurse, and...and now I'm in love?
3623	Carla	Mm...Sweetie...it happens.
3624	J.D.'s Narration	I've been thinking a lot lately about taking chances.
3625	Dr. Cox	I want you to run a tox-screen and a full blood work-up for the guy in 37 you can handle all that, right?
3626	Elliot	Yeah.
3627	Dr. Cox	Good girl. Up on the second floor, holy cow, there's a laundry list of stuff I want you to do....
3628	J.D.'s Narration	...And how it's really just about overcoming your fears. Because the truth is, every time you take a big risk in your life, no matter how it ends up, you're always glad you took it.
3629	J.D.	Wait! Stop the machine!
3630	Alex	What the hell are you doing!?
3631	J.D.	Will you go out with me?
3632	Alex	If I say no, will you still let me out of this thing?
3633	J.D.	It's iffy.
3634	Alex	Then I guess I have to say yes, don't I?
3635	J.D.	So, say it.

3642	J.D.	Yes! YES! YES!!! You _are_ hot! Smokin' hot! In your face! WOO-HOO-HOOOOO!

3644	J.D.'s Narration	Had our first dinner....
3645	J.D.'s Narration	Rented our first movie....
3646	J.D.'s Narration	Took our first long drive....
3647	Alex	Look out!
3648	J.D.'s Narration	...Killed our first raccoon.
3649	J.D.'s Narration	Ever since then, every date we've been on has always ended the same way.
3650	Alex	Nooo!
3651	J.D.	Oh, it's Cox he wants me back at the hospital.
3652	Alex	But the page is addressed to Lillian.
3653	J.D.	Yeah, that's me.
3654	J.D.'s Thoughts	What a drag....

3657	Re-open	I.C.U.
3658	Dr. Cox	Here's the deal: I have been coerced by the forces of evil into conducting rounds this morning.
3659	Dr. Kelso	Why do you have to do rounds? Because I'm sleeping. How's that?
3660	Dr. Cox	So, in order to make this a more palatable experience for moi, I am not going to call you by your names instead, I'll be referring to you by whatever distinguishing physical characteristic occurs to me first. Okay...you, Chicken Beak : What causes pneumonia presenting with diarrhea?
3661	Dr. Simotas	Legionella.
3662	Dr. Cox	Nice job! It turns out your mind's just as sharp as your nose. Whoo! And you, Dye Job:
3663	Dr. Cox	What are the elements of Whipple's Triad?
3664	Elliot	Uhh....
3665	J.D.'s Narration	It's hard to describe how scary it is when you don't know an answer at rounds.
3666	Elliot	I can't remember. I am so sorry.
3667	Dr. Cox	Sorry? What in the hell are you sorry about?
3668	Elliot	Well, it's just, Dr. Kelso always yells at us when we don't know the answer, and
3669	Dr. Cox	Oh, children, you can't let that bloated bag of hate affect you like that! And, besides, being a doctor is as much about finding the answers as it is about knowing them. For instance, take Clara Belle's patient, here, Mr. Yeager. Now, we have no idea what in the hell's wrong with him, so we have run tests for everything from Meningitis to Intracranial Mass. And according to these results oh! everything seems to have come back negative.
3670	Dr. Cox	Which doesn't necessarily mean that Clara Belle, here, is a failure it doesn't. It just means that she's got to keep trying, no matter how frustrated she just might get. Now, 'course, if you are lazy and incompetent, then, yes, that will buy you a one-way ticket out of here. Doug.
3671	Dr. Cox	Uh-huh. Listen to me carefully: Kelso can't do a damn thing to you if you just answer a question wrong. It doesn't work that way. Moving on.
3672	Dr. Cox	Not you you still have work to do.
3673	Dr. Cox	Johnny No-Tan?
3674	Doug	Yes, sir?
3675	Dr. Cox	I'd like you to present the next patient to me.
3676	Turk	I love you.
3677	Carla	Mmm. Now say it in Spanish.
3678	Turk	Te amo.
3679	Carla	Now...say it like Astro.
3680	Turk	I ruv roo.
3681	Carla	You are very, very cute.
3682	Turk	Yeah, I know. You know, I've been thinking about this whole "I love you" thing?
3683	Carla	Mmm?
3684	Turk	It's gonna make everything so much better. I mean, we're so in sync. Better conversation...better dancing....
3685	Carla	Ooh. And...?
3686	Turk	Way better _________.

3693	Janitor	You mind not staring at me while I'm eating? I hate it.
3694	J.D.	But, I'm not, I was....
3695	Janitor	What am I doing right now?
3696	J.D.	Eating.
3697	Janitor	What are you doing?
3698	J.D.	Staring....
3699	Janitor	Okay.
3700	Janitor	There. Now no one gets to eat it! Ya happy?
3701	J.D.	Not really.
3702	Alex	Hey, you!
3703	J.D.	Hi!
3704	J.D.	You know what's great about you working in the hospital?
3705	Alex	Hm?
3706	J.D.	Like, even when our dates get interrupted, we can just have a date here. Yeah, like, let's say for instance you wanted to watch a movie we could just go to the conference room and watch that video on S.T.D.s. It's funny, and it makes you think!
3707	Alex	Look, maybe it would be good if we actually had a date that...ends.
3708	J.D.	Well, how does a date with you end?
3709	Alex	It can range from a kiss at the door to...all I have for breakfast is yogurt, and I'm out of bowls, so you'll have to eat off my stomach.
3710	J.D.	Tonight. Dinner. Hyde's.
3711	Alex	It's a date.

3713	J.D.	So, judging from the ataxia dysarthia and the mental status change, I've concluded that Mr. Yeager is suffering from...Kuru.

3716	Dr. Cox	Kuru.
3717	J.D.	Yes, Kuru.
3718	Dr. Cox	Wow. I'd actually never thought of that.
3719	J.D.	Hell, yeah.
3720	Dr. Cox	Were you aware that the only documented cases of Kuru were members of a cannibalistic tribe in eastern Papua New Guinea?
3721	J.D.	I was not.
3722	Mr. Yeager	Actually, Doc, I was in New Guinea just last week.
3723	J.D.	Really?
3724	Mr. Yeager	No.
3725	Dr. Cox	Newbie, do you happen to know what a zebra is?
3726	J.D.	That patient just mocked me!
3727	Dr. Cox	It's a diagnosis of a ridiculously obscure disease when it's much more likely that the patient has a common illness presenting with uncommon symptoms. In other words, if you hear hoof-beats, you just go ahead and think horsies not zebras. Mm'kay, Mr. Silly Bear?
3728	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
3729	Elliot	What's wrong?
3730	Carla	It's personal.
3731	Elliot	Why won't you ever open up to me? I came to you when I thought I had a broken tailbone and it was just a really bad pimple!
3732	Carla	It's a sex thing, okay?
3733	Elliot	You mean like a gender issue or like intercourse? Because I'm book-smart on both!
3734	Elliot	Carla! Use me.
3735	Turk	So, last night, when I was with Carla....
3736	J.D.	Dude, I'm sorry I can't talk right now. I really gotta figure this Mr. Yeager thing out.
3737	Turk	Cool. Cool.
3738	J.D.	Okay.
3739	Turk	Let's just say my horse didn't finish the race. I mean, I'm at the filling station but my credit card gets declined. I'm on the jet ski
3740	J.D.	I got it!
3741	Turk	Good, 'cause I had no idea what I was gonna say after that one.
3742	J.D.	No, no, no. Mr. Yeager!

3746	J.D.'s Narration	Afternoon rounds that day began like any other.
3747	Dr. Kelso	This patient is hypoglycemic; what would be the most telling sign of an insulinoma, Dr. Reid?
3748	Elliot	Uh, elevated fasting C-peptide levels.
3749	Dr. Kelso	Score! But before you do your crazy end-zone dance, can you tell me the spinal fluid findings in Guillain-Barré Syndrome?
3750	Elliot	Uhh, Xanthochromia?
3751	Dr. Kelso	Wrong!
3752	J.D.'s Narration	And then it happened: Suddenly, Dr. Kelso didn't seem as frightening.
3753	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Reid, what do you have to say for yourself?
3754	Elliot	Win some, lose some.
3755	J.D.'s Narration	In fact, nothing he did seemed to scare us.
3756	Dr. Kelso	Booga-booga-booga-booga!!!
3757	J.D.'s Narration	Not anymore.
3758	J.D.'s Narration	Not even the most horrible thing he could think of.
3759	Carrot Top	All right! Welcome to the I.C.U!
3760	Carrot Top	No, really, sit down. All right.
3761	Carrot Top	Check it out, it's a cookbook for women who don't know how to cook I put the yellow pages in there. What do you want? Mexican? Italian? Japanese? American Cuisine?

3772	Carla	You know, that's really getting annoying. In fact, every time you say it, it makes me not want to talk to you all the more.
3773	Elliot	Talk to me....
3774	Carla	All right! Fine! Last night, Turk and I were...you know, messing around?
3775	Turk	...It's really hot, like always.
3776	Todd	Well, hot like how? Describe it.
3777	Turk	Dude! So, suddenly, things aren't happening. Know what I mean?
3778	Carla	I don't understand it; the only thing that's changed is that we said "I love you" to each other.
3779	Turk	Okay, it's true, I have never said "I love you" to a woman before.
3780	Todd	Well, then, how do you get them to sleep with you?
3781	Carla	It's three little words, it shouldn't have this effect, right? Anyway, I told him it wasn't his fault these things happen occasionally
3782	Elliot	Try "constantly"!
3783	Elliot	Um...well, I have cold hands....
3784	Todd	So, when I saw you in the hall this morning, and I said, "How's your penis?" and you didn't want to talk about it....
3785	Turk	Dude. It's not me.
3786	Carla	It's _me_. Last night, for the first time ever in our relationship, no matter how long we tried, I was unable to have an....a....uh....

3793	J.D.	See, I noticed he had a rash on his legs, right? And then I realized he's been having jaw claudication, which led me to....
3794	Dr. Cox	Temporal Arteritis. Of course it is. Nurse?
3795	Dr. Cox	Will you start Mr. Yeager on high-dose Solumedrol and get the surgery resident he needs a temporal artery biopsy, stat.
3796	Dr. Cox	Now, Newbie, I'm relatively certain I can handle this. You're off anyway, aren't you?
3797	J.D.	Yeah, whatever. I'm with you.
3798	Dr. Cox	Fair enough. Let's go treat the patient.

We're still...cool, right?

3826	J.D.	"Look, J.D., we're still great," right?
3827	Alex	I-I think you're a really good guy, okay, but....
3828	J.D.	Alex dumped me.
3829	Dr. Cox	Aw, you mean the blind girl you've been dating?
3830	J.D.	She's not blind.
3831	Dr. Cox	Of course she's not. Okay, Newbie, how'd you drop the ball on this one? And don't tell me you cried, or I'm gonna have you banned from the men's room again.
3832	J.D.	Well, I was just so excited about what we were doing here last night, I just forgot all about our date.
3833	Dr. Cox	You didn't forget. You kept looking at your watch. I saw you.
3834	Dr. Cox	I just naturally assumed that you were just afraid of missing 'Judging Amy' it never occurred to me that you were choosing work over being with that sweet little biscuit, you stupid piss-ant.
3835	J.D.	Well, you know what? That that means a lot coming from you, Mr. Right Here With Me Two Hours After His Shift, Also...And Last Monday Night, Too...Guy.
3836	Dr. Cox	What?
3837	J.D.	You heard me.
3838	Dr. Cox	Newbie, what are you saying? That you want to be like me? Do you understand that...I just barely want to be like me?

3840	Elliot	Listen, Carla, I can't even pretend that I can give you tips on intercourse....
3841	Carla	I got one for you stop calling it that.
3842	Elliot	My therapist thinks my trouble in bed stems from a basic fear of intimacy. But I just think it's just because any type of repetitive motion makes me nauseous. Oh, and since I was a little kid, I've always had nightmares about being crushed.
3843	Carla	That poor shrink.
3844	Elliot	Yeah.... The one thing I do know is that I've sabotaged a lot of relationships by never talking things out with the guy that I'm seeing.
3845	Carla	Thanks.
3846	Elliot	Sure.
3847	Carla	Hey!
3848	Carla	So...you've _really_ never had....?
3849	Elliot	Nope.

3854	Dr. Kelso	Ted. I need you to take care of some lawyer crap for me, and it would be a great help if you would go to traffic court for me and make this go away.
3855	Lawyer	I...don't think so.
3856	Dr. Kelso	Excuse me?
3857	Lawyer	No, Bob. I have my own things I need to take care of.
3858	Dr. Kelso	Of course. Of course....
3859	Lawyer	Walk off, bitch.
3860	Dr. Cox	How is it, exactly, that _you_ just said that and your pants are still dry?
3861	Lawyer	Don't you understand what you did when you spoke to those interns? You took away the fear. You...are a wonderful person. And...I love you.

3863	J.D.'s Thoughts	I have to ask Alex for another chance. I have to.
3864	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, she's with a very hot guy. Stay calm, she's gonna be psyched to see you.
3865	Alex	J.D. Hey.
3866	J.D.'s Thoughts	Or not....
3867	J.D.	You were right, I don't prioritize you over my job, but I'd like to. Look, Alex, I wanted to be a doctor for so long, I sort of forgot how to want anything else. And now I meet you and I Look, all I'm trying to say is, I'll do anything in the world if you give me a second chance.

3875	Turk	No time for talk we have a specific problem, and we need to take care of it.
3876	Carla	Why are you wearing one of those nose breathing thingies?
3877	Turk	Baby, bear with me I got big ideas.
3878	Carla	Look, I've been having all these thoughts going through my head, and I'm afraid that if I tell you I would scare you away; that's the last thing that I want to Just take that damn thing off!
3879	Carla	Oh, God.
3880	Turk	Baby, there's nothing that could scare me away.
3881	Carla	Ever since we said "I love you" to each other, I've been feeling all this pressure, and wondering about the future our future. Like, are we gonna get married? Are we gonna have kids? If so, how many, and when will I get my figure back? Should I keep working? Where're we gonna live? Is my mother gonna live with us? How big a house do we need? How many bathrooms? What if my mother walks in on you while you're in the bathroom, you slip and fall, and I can't afford the funeral costs?
3882	Turk	Okay, that's a little scary.
3883	Carla	I guess...I just need to know you think about that stuff, too.
3884	Turk	Carla! Oh....
3885	Turk	....No, I don't.
3886	Carla	Oh.
3887	Turk	But I love it that you do.
3888	Carla	Yeah?
3889	Turk	Yeah. I think that's what makes this relationship work; we're so different. I keep us in the present, and you look out for what's up ahead.
3890	Turk	Besides, there is no way in hell your mother is ever going to live with us.
3891	Turk	I'm serious, if she ever walks in on me while I'm in the bathroom, I guarantee you: she's getting a trip to Florida.
3892	Carla	No she's not!
3893	Turk	I'm telling you hey, ow, ow she's going to a home!

3895	Dr. Cox	Now, ladies and germs, I guarantee you that if you get this shorthand down, it has a way of making your day go just a little bit quicker. "C.T.D." of course being "circling the drain" your patient is on the way out. "S.O.B." "shortness of breath"; and "W.N.L." "within normal limits." Elvis, you go ahead and feel free to write this down anytime you want before you leave the building, sweetheart.
3896	Dr. Kelso	You paged me?
3897	Dr. Cox	I didn't page you.
3898	J.D.'s Narration	And that's when Dr. Cox started poking the old bear with a stick.
3899	Dr. Cox	You know what, I'm sick of the old grill-'em-and-drill-'em. What do you say we shake things up a littler bit, here? You kids ask me the questions, and I'll just give you the answers; whatta you say?
3900	Dr. Kelso	Uh, Dr. Cox, could I talk to you?
3901	Dr. Cox	Well, sure you can, Bob, but you're gonna have to go ahead and raise your hand like all the other children.
3902	Dr. Kelso	I I just think it's inappropriate
3903	Dr. Cox	Bobbo, now, you've got five good ones right there. Whatta you say you put 'em up in the air like you just don't care.
3904	Dr. Kelso	Get over here. Right now!
3905	J.D.'s Narration	Maybe he felt sorry for Kelso and didn't want to take away the one thing the guy had.
3906	Dr. Kelso	How on earth are they ever going to learn anything....
3907	J.D.'s Narration	...maybe he just hated rounds, I don't know.
3908	Dr. Kelso	...ridiculous! Now get the hell out of my I.C.U! I'm taking over!
3909	J.D.'s Narration	But if you didn't know Dr. Cox like I did, you'd have believed his performance, too.
3910	J.D.'s Narration	I guess the key to a lot of things is balance. Whether it's balance of power...
3911	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Simotas, stop smiling!
3912	Dr. Kelso	I hate smiling.
3913	J.D.'s Narration	...balance in love...
3914	J.D.'s Narration	...or sometimes just balance.
3915	J.D.'s Narration	For some of us, it seems too far out of reach...
3916	J.D.'s Narration	...too difficult to achieve.
3917	J.D.'s Narration	....But the important thing is just to never stop trying...

3923	J.D.'s Narration	The air feels crisper, the sun seems brighter...even your morning breath smells good.
3924	Alex	You taste like old eggs.
3925	J.D.	Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
3926	Alex	I love old eggs.
3927	Alex	You are so different from the guys I usually go out with.
3928	J.D.	How so?
3929	Alex	Well, for starters...
3930	Alex	...I'm still wearing pants.
3931	J.D.	Yeah, well, that is because I respect you.
3932	Alex	Oh, yeah?
3933	J.D.	Yeah. And also, this triple-knot, I couldn't get out.
3934	J.D.	Argh!
3935	Alex	Hey, thanks for being so patient with me. I hope you don't think I'm a big tease. I just...I love sleeping in the same bed with you. I've never slept better, you know?
3936	J.D.	Me neither.
3937	Alex	Mm.
3938	J.D.	You know, in fact, I'll go ahead and say it: I hope we never have sex.
3939	Alex	What would you say...if I told you I feel ready right now.
3940	J.D.	Whatever....
3941	Alex	Oh, okay, then I think tonight, we should get a nice bottle of wine
3942	J.D.	Yeah, tonight is good, but I think now also good.
3943	Alex	Yeah, now works...sure.

3967	Dr. Cox	Tell me, Laverne, are you in fact part golden retriever?
3968	Nurse Roberts	Keep it holy, now.
3969	Dr. Cox	I only ask because, every time I toss this guy, you bring him right back to me.
3970	Dr. Cox	All right, Will and Grace: break down.
3971	Elliot	Judging by Mr. Barnes' elevated lipase, I'd say it's pancreatitis.
3972	Dr. Cox	Okay, Grace, you wanna finish?
3973	J.D.	I'd start him on a Demerol drip and
3974	Dr. Cox	Ohhh, the throbbing's back.
3975	Elliot	Mr. Barnes has been admitted for substance abuse three times in the past year.
3976	J.D.	Yeah, but he said he quit.
3977	Dr. Cox	Oh! The addict said he quit? Why wouldn't you tell me something like that? 'Cause, don't you see, that changes everything.
3978	J.D.	I believe in Mr. Barnes.
3979	Dr. Cox	Lookit, Newbie: Just because you have a new girlfriend doesn't mean that the world has suddenly turned in to a giant green M&M. The Red Sox still suck, they do; Barbie, here, still can't decide what to do with those annoying bangs....
3980	Dr. Cox	...And addicts everywhere will still lie, cheat, and steal just to get a fix.
3981	Dr. Cox	...Now, you've got to wake up, Sweetheart, you're gonna be late for school Aw, you wet the bed! Why can't I have a normal child without these problems?!

4012	J.D.	Yes, please!

4014	Alex	Hm?
4015	J.D.	...Or, like, eighty minutes?
4016	Elliot	I just wanted to tell you the nurses just did a check of the narcotics drawer, and there's 50 Percocet missing.
4017	J.D.	What we should do is split up into teams and search every room. We'll take this one.
4018	Elliot	Fine.
4019	Alex	You know they're gonna go right to Mr. Barnes; I'm gonna go check on him, okay?
4020	J.D.	Uh, Alex?

4035	Rude Man	Son of a bitch. Do you mind, lady? I am in a rush.
4036	Carla	Oh, my goodness! I'm so sorry. What am I doing thinking I can take an extra six seconds to pick my breakfast? I'm gonna have to call my mom and tell her she did a lousy job raising me. Thank you, so much.

4048	Elliot	Yeah, and three of them are in comas, two others can't walk, and one's a nun.
4049	J.D.	Also a very valid point.
4050	Alex	Look, Elliot, I'm sure Mr. Barnes didn't take the drugs he has been in rehab for over six months!
4051	Elliot	Mmm?
4052	Alex	There's no reason to be so judgmental.
4053	Elliot	I am _not_ judgmental. If I were, I'd tell you your shoes are ugly.
4054	J.D.	Do _not_ stoop to her level.
4055	Alex	Your bangs make you look like a chipmunk.
4056	Elliot	It's a _frame_. Why can nobody see that!?
4057	J.D.	Can we get back to the matter at hand? This is about Mr. Barnes.
4058	Alex	Fine. So who do you think's right?
4059	Elliot	Yeah?
4060	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, crap.
4061	Turk	Hey.
4062	Dr. Cox	Oh, for the love of Oprah! Why, why, _why_ would you come to Pediatrics!?
4063	Turk	'Cause I can't go unless you're around. You're my little pee buddy!
4064	Dr. Cox	Whatta you say we cut to the chase? You're dating Carla, the one person in this hospital I can remotely stand, and she wants us to get all kissy-face with each other I get it, I do. But, you see, every single time I shake my magic 8 ball and ask it, "Are we gonna be best friends forever?" do you know what it says?
4065	Turk	No.
4066	Dr. Cox	"Outlook is buh-leak."
4067	Turk	Well, Dr. Cox, you really can't trust those things. I mean, when I was nine, I asked mine if I should crack it open and drink the fluid inside; I puked blue for, like, three days!
4068	Dr. Cox	Just a real cute story. Here's what you're gonna do: Go back to Carla, and don't obsess about why she's with you in the first place. Just...tell her we went to a ball game and we borrowed each other's sweaters. Nn'kay, little buddy?
4069	Turk	What?

4073	Nurse Roberts	Pippin. Bob Kelso is a bad man.
4074	Carla	I don't know; I mean, we never think about how hard it is to always be the bad guy, you know?
4075	Nurse Roberts	I want him to die!
4076	Nurse Roberts	Hello, Sweetness!
4077	Dr. Kelso	Ladies. Carla, I was thinking about what you said this morning about your mother's birthday, and I don't want her spending it alone, so I've arranged for you to swap shifts with the nurse on the third floor.
4078	Carla	Oh, Dr. Kelso....
4079	Dr. Kelso	Don't mention it! And, should I pick you up tomorrow morning at the same place?

4085	Turk	Smooth.
4086	J.D.	Yeah. It's just, you know, they both have a point
4087	Turk	Stick to the booty principle.
4088	J.D.	What's that?
4089	Turk	The booty principle: Which one do you want to sleep with?
4090	J.D.	Alex.
4091	Turk	Then I think _she_ might be right.
4092	J.D.'s Thoughts	I'm not sure about Turk's advice; I mean, sometimes he oversimplifies things especially when it comes to booty.
4093	Alex	What would you say if I told you I feel ready right...now.
4094	J.D.	I agree with Alex. Yeah, I've been thinking about it a lot, and I think that, you know, she's right about Mr. Barnes we can't we can't just jump to conclusions.
4095	Elliot	Oh, I am _so_ surprised.
4096	J.D.	Hey, tell me something: What do what do you think about Alex?
4097	Elliot	No way! I am not saying anything about a girl that you're sleeping with!
4098	Janitor	He's not sleeping with her.
4099	J.D.	I'm serious. Look, no ramifications, nothing, just tell me what you think
4100	Elliot	I don't like her; I don't trust her, and I'm afraid that she's gonna hurt you.
4101	J.D.	You're jealous!
4102	Elliot	Shut up!
4103	J.D.	So, "Shut up" because you're so jealous of her...that you don't even care that I'm happy for once.
4104	Elliot	Do you honestly believe that's what's going on here?
4105	J.D.'s Thoughts	Do not, under any circumstances, say what you're thinking.

4113	Dr. Kelso	That's what I like about you, Carla! You don't give a rat's ass what anybody thinks!

4126	Turk	Yeah, yeah; well, um, what's up?
4127	Dr. Cox	The guy has two-vessel disease, and he hasn't been tried on medical management, so he's got a couple options and neither....
4128	J.D.'s Narration	When an Attending calls a lowly intern for a consult, it's an unwritten law that the intern should agree with whatever he says.
4129	Dr. Cox	...Don't you agree?
4130	Turk	Actually, sir, uh, I recommend bypass surgery.
4131	J.D.	Wow...that's my pager!

4137	J.D.'s Thoughts	I can't believe how stubborn she is she she is not even moving out of the way. I am the wrong man to play chicken with, missy. She'll blink.... Any second now.
4138	J.D.	She is so stubborn!
4139	Carla	Laverne, could you had me some gauze, please?
4140	Nurse Roberts	Maybe Dr. Kelso can pick you up in the morning and take you to the gauze store.
4141	Carla	All right, now listen
4142	Dr. Kelso	Carla, this paperwork has your signature on it, and it is totally sub-par!
4143	Dr. Kelso	I won't stand for this kind of shoddy work!
4144	Nurse Roberts	Let me help you, Honey.
4145	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
4146	Turk	So, you went behind my back and got an intern to agree with you so the guy doesn't get surgery.
4147	Dr. Cox	Oh, no; you caught me.
4148	Turk	Cox, a bypass is the right call.
4149	Dr. Cox	Considering the inherent risks in surgery, I didn't
4150	Turk	The guy's a diabetic, with two-vessel disease!
4151	Dr. Cox	And antianginals can be equally effective.
4152	Turk	So we agree that either treatment could work?
4153	Dr. Cox	Yeah, sure.
4154	Turk	Then what the hell are we arguing about!?
4155	Carla	Hey!
4156	Turk	Hey, Babe.
4157	Dr. Cox	Hey, Sweetie.
4158	J.D.'s Narration	And it was just then that they realized what was really going on: Dr. Cox was in love with Turk's girlfriend!
4159	Carla	Hey, either one of you want half a sandwich?
4160	Dr. Cox	I'm all set.
4161	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
4162	J.D.	So, every tox-screen came back negative on Mr. Barnes. He didn't...take anything.
4163	Elliot	So?
4164	J.D.	So...you were wrong.
4165	Elliot	Yeah, it's not about that anymore, is it?
4166	J.D.'s Narration	When you can't make things right with one of your best friends, nothing can make you feel better.
4167	Alex	Hey, I'm finally off; do you wanna get out of here?
4168	Alex	Hello?
4169	J.D.	So, are we doing this, or what?
4170	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
4171	Carla	Dr. Kelso.
4172	Dr. Kelso	Yes, what is it?
4173	Carla	I wanted to thank you...for what you did. You know, when you yelled at me in front of the other nurses. I appreciate it.
4174	Dr. Kelso	Young lady, I yelled at you because that paperwork looked like it had been done by a drunk four-year-old. Listen, Carla, I have a family who loves me, a handful of close friends, and a wonderful hobby shop in my basement; I don't spend much time worrying about people's feelings around here I just do whatever makes me happy.
4175	Carla	So...can I still get a ride tomorrow?
4176	Dr. Kelso	I don't know if I've forgiven you yet for hiding this morning. But, uh, you could always skip the bus tomorrow morning and take your chances.
4177	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
4178	Dr. Cox	Look, we're both men; one of us a little more than the other, but that's okay.
4179	Turk	What do you want?
4180	Dr. Cox	I'm not gonna do anything to mess up what you got with Carla that's not my game.
4181	Turk	I won't tell Carla how you feel about her that's not my place.
4182	Dr. Cox	But, the minute you screw this thing up and you will screw it up I'll be waiting.
4183	Turk	Well, if you're gonna wait, I'd bring a book, 'cause it's gonna be a while.
4184	Dr. Cox	You goin' in?
4185	Turk	Oh, yeah, I'm right behind you.
4186	Dr. Cox	Cool.
4187	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
4188	J.D.	You remember, like, when the new 'Star Wars' movie came out, and it was all built up, and then people went to see it and it really wasn't that great in bed?
4189	Alex	Relax! The first one's a freebie, so you can get your form back.
4190	Alex	Mmm. I'm gonna change.
4191	J.D.	Mm-mm, Mm-mm. Don't look, no, no. Don't look, no, no.
4192	J.D.	I already brushed, like, eight times, but I'm gonna wanna take some mints out of your purse.
4193	Alex	See, all I did was lose the pants, but I think it gives me a completely different look.
4194	J.D.	These are Percocet.
4195	Alex	J.D....
4196	J.D.	So, you never came over here last night 'cause you just passed out.
4197	Alex	Yep...I should I should go; yeah.
4198	J.D.'s Narration	The speech always sounds the same, no matter whose mouth is comes out of even if it's someone you thought you could really like.
4199	Alex	Hey, look, you don't understand, okay; my job comes with a lot of stress. It's it's not like I have a serious problem.
4200	J.D.'s Narration	We ended up talking for a while after that....
4201	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
4202	J.D.'s Narration	And I gave her some names of people that could help her.
4203	J.D.'s Narration	But she never got back to me.
4204	J.D.'s Narration	After that, things pretty much got back to normal.
4205	Janitor	You owe me twenty bucks.
4206	J.D.	No, but I never even made
4207	Janitor	Twenty bucks.
4208	J.D.	All right, I should've done this a long time ago; so, here goes: I'm sorry. I shouldn't accuse you of being jealous, you were just looking out for me, and...you were right about Alex.
4209	Elliot	You never did sleep with her, did you?
4210	J.D.	No.... But, why does that matter?
4211	Elliot	Because I was jealous.
4212	J.D.	Are you sure?
4213	Cut to	J.D.'s Bedroom
4214	Elliot	What are you thinking about?
4215	J.D.	This.
4216	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
4217	An alarm clock, reading a little after 6	5, goes off.
4218	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, my God; you slept with your best friend! This will be a disaster unless you say he right thing, so choose your words carefully.
4219	J.D.	Great job last night, buddy.
4220	J.D.'s Thoughts	Ew.
4221	J.D.	Good thing you came along. I've been stuck on four since med school.
4222	J.D.	OWWWWW!
4223	Cut to	The Living Room
4224	Elliot	Dammit.
4225	Elliot	We we really shouldn't feel weird about this. I mean, this things like this happen all the time.
4226	J.D.	All the time!
4227	Elliot	Yeah, it's, uh, it's really not a big deal.
4228	J.D.	It's not a big deal!
4229	Elliot	Okay, you've gotta stop repeating everything I say in that weird tone of voice.
4230	J.D.	No more repeating....
4231	Elliot	Look, J.D., what happened last night was a wonderful mistake. I think it's probably best if we just go back to the way things were.
4232	J.D.	I totally agree.
4233	Elliot	Well, I'm gonna see you tomorrow.
4234	J.D.	Tomorrow...
4235	J.D.'s Thoughts	What are you doing? Elliot's amazing, and you're crazy about her. If you let her leave, I'm gonna do this all day: "I get knocked down! But I get up again! You're never gonna keep me down! I get knocked down! "
4236	J.D.	Wait, Elliot.
4237	J.D.	Look, I just, uh.... Argggh.... I...I....
4238	Elliot	Oh, my God, just say it! Say, "Elliot, stay in bed and have sex with me all day until neither one of us can move."
4239	J.D.	Yeah, let's do that.
4240	Elliot	I cannot believe you almost let me leave.
4241	Elliot	You're gonna pay for that.
4242	J.D.	Oh, I'm I'm good for that.
4243	J.D.	Whoa.... I got...to, uh....
4244	JD	Ow!

4246	J.D.	We are really good at having sex.
4247	J.D.	We should, like, take this show on the road.
4248	Elliot	Oh, don't joke. My mom would come sit in the front row and tell me I'd look prettier if I smiled more.
4249	J.D.	You don't really smile, though, you just make this face...
4250	Elliot	What about you? You just look surprised that you're actually having sex!
4251	J.D.	Well, I was, girl. I mean, four times? I mean, seriously, give it up.
4252	Elliot	I think I already did.
4253	J.D.	Yeah, you did.
4254	Elliot	God, how weird was that this morning? I mean, have you ever been more uncomfortable in your entire life?
4255	J.D.'s Grandmother	What movie are we watching?
4256	J.D.	It's 'Basic Instinct', grandma.
4257	J.D.	...Yeah, once. But see, all this sex, it just soothes my soul....
4258	Elliot	Mmmm.
4259	J.D.	...And I really like your nose....
4260	Elliot	How did that last time even start?
4261	J.D.	I don't even remember. I just know I went to the door, and when I came back, you said I looked sexy holding a pizza.
4262	Elliot	Oooh, you did.
4263	Elliot	Okay, for safety reasons, I should go. I should really go.
4264	J.D.	No, no....
4265	Elliot	Yep.
4266	J.D.	You're not going anywhere; 'cause you know why? You gotta help me eat this pizza.
4267	Elliot	Okay.
4268	J.D.	See, now, you even look sexy holding that slice.
4269	Elliot	...I do, don't I?
4270	J.D.	You do.
4271	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
4272	Elliot	I was not, you were!
4273	J.D.	Hey, baby, sometimes I like a little sugar in my coffee!
4274	Elliot	No, J.D. J.D., I just think it's best if we keep this between us for right now. I mean, it's hard enough at work without everybody talking.
4275	J.D.	But it'll it'll help people.
4276	J.D.	Like those two, for instance. I mean, they've been dancing around each other for months, now.
4277	J.D.	And you know what, excuse me for not being afraid to show people around here how I feel about you.
4278	Elliot	You just want the guys to know you're getting some!
4279	J.D.	Not just the guys.
4280	J.D.	Good morning, Dr. Cox!
4281	Dr. Cox	We are short staffed today because Kelso has volunteered all of you scut-monkeys for some psychologist's research project give me a break which means, of course, you won't be helping patients. Instead...oh, you'll be blabbering about your feelings and what it's like working in the hospital, and how that affects your personal lives...and: Wah. Wah. Wah.
4282	Dr. Cox	And there he is now; oh, Big Bobbo, himself. Okay, all nurses and interns, let's gather 'round and dance for the puppet master! Oh, yes! Dance!
4283	Dr. Kelso	It's not just the nurses and interns....
4284	Dr. Cox	Don't be that guy, Bob.
4285	Flash to	A Small Office
4286	Dr. Cox	Well gosh, I guess I became a doctor because, ever since I was a little boy, I just wanted to help people. I don't...tell this story very often, but, I remember when I was seven years old, one time I found a bird that had fallen out of its nest. And so, I picked him up, and I brought him home, and I made him a house out of an empty shoebox, and Oh my God! I became a doctor for the same four reasons everybody does: Chicks, money, power, and chicks. But, since HMOs have made it virtually impossible to make any real money, which directly affects the number of chicks who come sniffing around and don't ask me what tree they're barkin' up, 'cause they're sure as hell not pissin' on mine. And as far as power goes, well, here I am during my free time letting some thirteen-year-old psychology fellow who couldn't cut it in real medicine ask me questions about my personal life. So, here's the inside scoop, there, pumpkin: Why don't you go ahead and tell me all about power.

4288	Todd	Check her out!
4289	Turk	Dude, H.F.F.A.
4290	J.D.	Excuse me?
4291	Turk	"H.F.F.A"? "Hot From Far Away", but up close, she's nasty?
4292	Turk	Baby, I am so sorry I made an incredibly insensitive statement about an ugly person.
4293	Carla	I'm taking one of those quiet moments where I weigh your good qualities against your bad ones and decide if you're actually worth the trouble.
4294	Carla	You made it. But that was close.
4295	Turk	Thank you, baby!
4296	Carla	You're welcome!
4297	Turk	So, Elliot says she's looking for a surgical consult. Do you know where she is?
4298	J.D.	I don't know. Why should I know? You know, it's funny that you think I would know I have no idea where she is.
4299	Todd	I know where The Todd would like Elliot to be: In his pants!
4300	J.D.	Ha! Clever! You know, she told me she's not going out with anyone, you should ask her out.
4301	Turk	Whoa, Ell no, no. Elliot and The Todd? That's a terrible couple. That's that's worse than Joanie and Chachi.
4302	J.D.	Dude, Joanie loves Chachi.
4303	Todd	The Todd is asking Elliot out. I think she'd be lucky to ride my
4304	J.D.	Please....
4305	Todd	...Motorcycle! Gotcha!
4306	Turk	God bless him.
4307	Flash to	The Psychologist's Office
4308	Turk	When I was seven years old, the only things that I loved were my ColecoVision and Sandi Lowe. Now, Sandi was as fine as a seven-year-old could be; I mean, she had the body of a nine-year-old. And I pretty much joined the t-ball team because she was on it. I mean, I didn't really care that much about sports. But, uh, during the first game, I got all caught up, you know? And...fell in love with competing; and so, through high school and college, I pretty much played everything, because I needed to compete it was my drug. I think that's why I became a surgeon, too, because, every day, you get to step up to the table and go one-on-one against what's-ever wrong with the patient. And if you're really good at it, you win most of the time....
4309	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
4310	Elliot	Are you following me?
4311	Todd	No! You wanna go out sometime?
4312	Elliot	With you?
4313	Todd	Me...and a bottle of Jagermeister!
4314	Elliot	No. No, Todd, I don't. But I don't want you to think it's because I just broke up with someone, or that I'm a lesbian, or because I want to 'preserve our friendship.' It's because I find you so creepy I think you should have to walk around with a bell around your neck.
4315	Todd	All I heard was "lesbian."
4316	J.D.	You know what, let me let me talk to her for ya.
4317	Todd	Okay.
4318	Elliot	Why did he ask me out?
4319	J.D.	I don't know.... Because you're cute, and you're fun...and I told him to....
4320	Elliot	What?
4321	J.D.	Plus, there's rumors going around that you're a lesbian.
4322	J.D.	Look, you told me not to tell anyone about us, and I guess maybe I just wanted to make a point. And, uh...now I'm gonna kiss you.
4323	Todd	Oh, no, it's cool. J.D.'s in the closet talking to a girl for me.
4324	Nurse Roberts	White boys.

4328	Carla	When I was a little girl, my mom used to have what she liked to call "Episodes." "Episodes" is a flattering term for this thing where she'd sweat a lot and...well, let's just say, her stomach talked. Anyway, this one time, we were at the supermarket and she actually passed out. And, out of nowhere, this fancy-looking guy comes forward and tells everyone to "step aside!" give my mother some air. And everyone did! You have to understand: in my family, nobody ever listens to a word anybody else says; even screaming at the top of our lungs nothing. So, when this man said "step aside" and everyone did, I asked my aunt, "Who is this guy?" And she said he was a doctor. And I thought, "Wow.... I wanna be a doctor, too." But, when I lost my first tooth, and nobody left a hundred-and-eighty-thousand dollars under my pillow, I decided to become a nurse....

4330	J.D.	You okay?
4331	Elliot	...Yeah. I mean, I may, eventually, need a vagina transplant.
4332	EMT	Go, go, go, go, go!
4333	EMT	We don't have much time!!!
4334	Elliot	You know what, after I have sex five times with somebody, I...usually like to have the relationship talk.
4335	Elliot	I know, I know it seems rushed, but, you have to understand, five times usually takes me anywhere between six months and seven years.
4336	J.D.	Okay, let's do it; let's have the talk.
4337	Elliot	Okay. You my boyfriend?
4338	J.D.	Yep. You my girlfriend?
4339	Elliot	Yep!
4340	J.D.	Cool.
4341	J.D.	Good to talk things through.

4345	Elliot	What?
4346	J.D.	I've seen you naked, so, like, everything you're doing, I'm watching you do it...naked.

4348	J.D.	Yeah, I just, I saw all of that.
4349	J.D.	Ohh, don't be shy; come here, baby.
4350	J.D.	...See the echo report on the aorta...
4351	Dr. Cox	Bravo; just a big bravo. Heaven help me, I love Newbie Theatre. Honest, I do.
4352	Dr. Cox	It's the way you both play your parts with such wonderful commitment that almost had me believing that you aren't having whiny, neurotic, extremely pale sex with each other.
4353	J.D.	What are you talking about?
4354	Dr. Cox	Please stop. The whole floor knows; we do. Watch this.
4355	Dr. Cox	Laverne, did you know?
4356	Nurse Roberts	Was it supposed to be a secret?
4357	Dr. Cox	And, Carla?
4358	Carla	Please. I knew before they did.
4359	Dr. Cox	So, there it is. Oh, and, if you go ahead and listen very carefully, you'll hear the familiar sound of no one caring.

4362	Dr. Kelso	When the Kelsonoviches settled in Monroeville, P.A., there were two steel mills, three bars, not a doctor in sight. Then, my old man set up a shingle and started delivering babies and stitching up three-fingered steel men by the wagon-load. Everybody loved him. When they couldn't come up with the cash, he would always gladly accept a handmade sweater or a bushel of turnips.... Jackass.

4369	J.D.	Oh, please, you guys are just jealous 'cause you're not the new hot couple in town anymore.
4370	Turk	Jealous, my chocolate butt!
4371	Carla	I'm telling you, we are so damn hot; last night, when I was home waiting for Turk, I put on this tiny negligee it was so small, I took it off my Latin Barbie
4372	Turk	Yeah but, baby, when I got home you were sound asleep and drooling like a sheepdog.
4373	Carla	You don't have to tell them that.

4402	Elliot	Yeah, I love it so much, I can't stop using it.
4403	J.D.	Well, see, it's not as charming if you're mad.
4404	Elliot	You know you only laugh at your own jokes? I mean, you never laugh at anything I do.
4405	J.D.	That's not true.
4406	Elliot	Oh hey, Dr. Cox, I'm open! Hit me!
4407	Elliot	There was nothing funny about that.
4408	J.D.	Oh, all right, maybe you just don't know funny. Okay; let me help you out: Silly hats are funny; ALF, very funny; anyone in a chicken suit.... Oh! Over-sized phones are funny.

4410	J.D.	Hold on.
4411	J.D.	Hello? ... ... She's right here.
4412	J.D.	It's for you.
4413	Elliot	You know what, you're not as funny as you think you are.
4414	Cut to	The Psychologist's Office
4415	Dr. Cox	...And bam! The shine's off the apple. And that's when you find out that that pretty little girl you married isn't a pretty little girl at all. No, she's a man-eater. And I'm not talking about the "whoa-whoa, here she comes" kind of man-eater. I'm talking about the kind that uses your dignity as a dishtowel to wipe up any shreds of manhood that might be stuck inside the sink. Of course, I may have tormented her from time to time; but, honest to God, that's what I thought marriage was all about. So much so that, by the end of that relationship, I honestly don't know who I hated more her or me? I used to sit around and wonder...why our friends weren't trying to destroy each other, like we were. And here, it turns out, the answer's pretty simple: They weren't unhappy. We were.

4417	Elliot	I suck at this. Sorry.
4418	J.D.	You look great bent over!
4419	Elliot	I'm not being obsessive, but I rolled that damn thing exactly the way the video I bought told me to.
4420	J.D.	Probably just a bad ball.
4421	Elliot	You don't always have to patronize me, I mean, you could just be honest with me and tell me that I suck.
4422	J.D.	You know what, Elliot, it's hard to be honest with you when you're so neurotic, you don't even trust the computer to keep your score.
4423	Elliot	Oh, so now I'm neurotic.
4424	J.D.	I'm sorry!
4425	Elliot	Is it always this hard?
4426	J.D.	Bowling's a tricky sport.
4427	Elliot	No, I meant
4428	J.D.	I know what you meant. It's difficult for everybody.

4432	Turk	My baby know how to knock 'em down! My baby know how to knock 'em down!
4433	Carla	Turk! Turk! I'm dizzy!
4434	Turk	Sorry.
4435	Carla	I'm sorry about him.

4437	J.D.	Want me to pick you up...?
4438	Elliot	Mm-hmm.
4439	Cut to	The Psychologist's Office
4440	Dr. Kelso	Enid has always understood how much my career meant to me. She knows I'm an important man in my field, and it helps her get on all those little boards of things her friends are on.... You know, like, uh, bringing art to the underprivileged kids in the community, blah-blah-blah. When I first met her, uh, she wanted the be a psychiatrist, but, uh...we both decided that that wasn't a fitting profession for a family woman no offense, sweetheart. I know she's grateful. She likes to joke that I "choked the last breath of life out of her long ago, now she's just a shell of a woman." I think that's so cute; I call her "shelly"! You know, when I call her that, sometimes she laughs so hard she cries a little.

4442	Dr. Cox	Oh, what the hell, Barbie? You should have gotten the cardiology fellow to give Mrs. Zuckerman a transvenous pacemaker one hour ago.
4443	Elliot	Sir, I was waiting to see if
4444	Dr. Cox	Oh! You were waiting! I'm sorry, that's that's my mistake.... Oh! I'm gonna wait with ya!
4445	Elliot	Dr. Cox
4446	Dr. Cox	You gotta give it time; because you see, when you're waiting for someone to magically get better all by themselves, the whole thing becomes about time.
4447	Elliot	Dr. Cox, I was waiting to see if she would tolerate her low heart-rate, which is exactly what all the medical textbooks tell us to do. Am I right, J.D.?
4448	Dr. Cox	Is she right, J.D.?
4449	J.D.	Uhhhh.... Well, technically, yes.
4450	J.D.	But, you know, it's it's really a judgment call, and if she really was that bradycardic, I probably would've called the fellow....
4451	J.D.	But I, that's that's me. I....
4452	Dr. Cox	Wow. Always side with the hoochie, Newbie. It's rookie mistake. Gosh, you you hate to see it.
4453	Cut to	The Psychologist's Office
4454	Carla	You want me to tell you about my boyfriend?
4455	Turk	You want me to tell you about my girlfriend?
4456	Turk	Okay, um.... I can be myself around Carla, you know?
4457	Carla	Turk makes me feel completely safe, and totally independent at the same time.
4458	Turk	...And uh, it's it's all the same, whether I'm with her, or with my boys.
4459	Carla	I can say whatever's on my mind and even if he doesn't like it even if he doesn't understand it he respects it.
4460	Turk	Don't get me wrong, I'm not gonna give my boys a back rub; I mean, sure, if a brothah's got an itch, I'll scratch it, but...
4461	Carla	He seems to like who I am.
4462	Turk	She's a cool lady.
4463	Carla	I love him.
4464	Turk	I love her.
4465	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
4466	J.D.	Hey.... I shoulda stood up for you with Dr. Cox.
4467	Elliot	Yeah, you should've.
4468	J.D.	I just I I don't want him to think it's about our relationship.
4469	Elliot	Look, I know that you want Dr. Cox to like you and to respect you, but you should want me to like and respect you, too.
4470	J.D.	Well, if I didn't respect you, I wouldn't be having sex with you. ...That's not true, I totally would be!
4471	Elliot	Look, if you can't talk about this for real, then forget it.
4472	J.D.	Ohh, a perfect dismount off her high horse.
4473	Elliot	If you don't like something, why don't you just say it; I mean, why do you always have to hide behind your stupid little jokes!?
4474	J.D.	Why is it impossible for you to ever let anything go?
4475	Elliot	Oh, I let tons of stuff go; like when you wouldn't stand up for me in front of Dr. Cox. Or when you started telling everyone we know that we're having sex.
4476	J.D.	And when are you when are you letting that stuff go?
4477	Elliot	Fine. You wanna know why I won't let that go? Because the only reason that you wouldn't stand up for me is that you're so terrified that someone, somewhere, in this hospital won't like you.
4478	J.D.	Oh, and that's a bad thing? That's a bad thing, Elliot? Why don't why don't we get all of my friends together in a room and we'll fight your friend.
4479	Elliot	I'm getting so tired of this.
4480	J.D.	Look, Elliot, this is me, okay? And there's a lot of people here who like me for who I am. I thought you were one of 'em.
4481	Elliot	I thought I was, too.
4482	Dr. Cox	Relationships don't work the way they do on television and in the movies: Will they, won't they, and then they finally do and they're happy forever gimme a break. Nine out of ten of them end because they weren't right for each other to begin with, and half the ones that get married get divorced, anyway. And I'm telling you right now, through all this stuff, I have not become a cynic, I haven't. Yes, I do happen to believe that love is mainly about pushing chocolate-covered candies and, you know, in some cultures, a chicken. You can call me a sucker, I don't care, 'cause I do...believe in it. Bottom line...is the couples that are truly right for each other wade through the same crap as everybody else, but, the big difference is, they don't let it take 'em down.
4483	Dr. Cox	....One of those two people will stand up and fight for that relationship every time, if it's right, and they're real lucky. One of them will say something.
4484	Cut to	The Psychologist's Office
4485	J.D.	Things that wouldn't'a bothered you a week ago in a friendship become so incredibly important when sex is involved. I just...I think it'd be easier if you weren't friends with your girlfriend.... At all.
4486	Cut to	Elliot, taking her turn.
4487	Elliot	I've always been so sure about everything in my life. I was I was sure I that wanted to be a doctor, and I was sure that I was gonna be married by the time I was 25.... But, relationships.... I always heard that when they were right, they were easy. That that, even when things got hard...that they were easy. I don't get that at all, you know. How is that possible?
4488	Cut to	J.D.
4489	J.D.	Am I in a relationship now?
4490	Back to	Elliot
4491	Elliot	...No. Uh, I'm not in one now.

4498	J.D.	Oh please, Elliot, I had, like, two pieces.
4499	Elliot	If you tell anyone anything about today, please leave that part out.
4500	J.D.	I will. 'Cause I'm a gentleman.
4501	Elliot	So...

4510	J.D.'s Thoughts	Don't let her get the last word.

4512	Elliot	You watch where you're walking!
4513	J.D.	Damn!

4516	J.D.'s Thoughts	And the next day.
4517	J.D.	You don't even play sports.

4525	J.D.'s Thoughts	I guess the only positive is that our hospital is like one
4526	J.D.	Dr. Cox, I was wondering-
4527	Dr. Cox	I'd say you're about a B-cup. Yeah.
4528	Janitor	At least they're real.

4540	J.D.	My mom called and said my favorite high school teacher just died.
4541	Dr. Cox	Yeah, the correct answer to that question is 'Nothing, Sir.'
4542	Dr. Cox	Oh. My. God. Would you look at this hellhole? If I have to see
4543	J.D.	I used to like the Silver Surfer.
4544	J.D.	Hang ten! Hang...
4545	Dr. Cox	Get in here.
4546	J.D.'s Thoughts	I guess after a while you get used to Dr. Cox's rants.
4547	Dr. Cox	And of course the lab tech is nowhere to be found, so I can't get
4548	J.D.'s Thoughts	The truth is that Dr. Cox isn't really angry. He's just
4549	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, maybe he's a little angry.

4556	Turk	But I don't have a packet.
4557	Turk	Look at that, Turk's packet. So you did this last night.

4563	J.D.	It's you.
4564	Elliot	Yeah. It's me.
4565	J.D.'s Thoughts	Ugh. Could Turk have picked anyone worse to be doing this
4566	Janitor	If this is a peripheral vascular disease study, they might find it
4567	J.D.	Uh, I'm going to go to bed.

4789	Elliot	Oh, my God! Turk, that was amazing!
4790	Turk	Woman. Woman! Shush.

4794	J.D.'s Thoughts	Whatever.
4795	J.D.'s Narration	The point is, we've found our stride; we know all the ins and outs.

4833	Dr. Kelso	Okay, let's go get 'em, doctors.
4834	Elliot	They're actually buying it.

4839	Turk	I gotta go.
4840	Turk	I gotta go meet up with my med student up in surgery.

4845	J.D.	So, I dunno-I'm just thinking I wa-I want someone I can be friends with, you know?

4857	J.D.	Don't worry about it, man, I do that all the time.
4858	Josh	Really? Do you ever part your hair on the wrong side just to see what you look like to other people?
4859	J.D.	No.
4860	Josh	It totally messes everyone up!
4861	J.D.	So, do you have any questions before we get started?

4884	Josh	Oh, um.... I can't really walk and write at the same time it makes me nauseous.
4885	J.D.'s Narration	A famous doctor once said, "Show me a med student that only triples my work, and I'll kiss his feet."
4886	Elliot	Philip, I'm gonna need you to shave this patient's groin so I can place a femoral _______.
4887	Philip	Yeah.... I'm not so much with the shaving a guy's curlies.
4888	Elliot	It's your call, Phil. 'Course, if you do go ahead and get one bad evaluation from me, it'll pretty much torch your class rank; so I suggest you do what I tell you.
4889	Elliot	And if I ask you to shave a patient's groin, I think you should thank your lucky stars I said "shave."

4895	Kristen	I'm kidding.

4897	Turk	Yeah.
4898	Dr. Cox	Introduce me.
4899	Turk	Excuse me?
4900	Dr. Cox	Next time we're face to face, you give me her name and then you tell her my name. Or you go: her name, my name; my name, her name. Whatever you're comfortable with.
4901	Turk	No. You like Carla.
4902	Dr. Cox	Do you actually listen to yourself when you speak, or do you find you drift in and out?
4903	Dr. Cox	Fine. Then, I'm gonna go ahead continue to focus all my energies on Carla.

4924	J.D.	Yes, Carla! They're each one mistake, but when you put 'em all together, it makes, like, 4 million mistakes!
4925	Carla	Did you just snap at me? Because I think he just snapped at me.
4926	Nurse Roberts	Mmm-hmmm.
4927	J.D.	I'm sorry.

4929	J.D.	I'm s I'm sorry.
4930	Carla	Egh.
4931	J.D.	Carla... I gotta go home.
4932	Nurse Roberts	Hold it, Q-Tip. You have to co-sign all these orders, fill out a vascular consult on Bed 3, and get a tox-screen for Mrs. O'Brien.

4959	Josh	I came by because...I know I didn't do so great yesterday, but
4960	J.D.	Wh-what was it that tipped you off? Was it your, uh, inability to perform even the simplest task? I'll bet it was the fact that I only got home twenty minutes ago because I spent the entire night cleaning up after you!
4961	Josh	I'm sorry. Um...I was just really scared.
4962	J.D.	Well, you know what, Josh, you should be scared. Because, I gotta be honest with you I don't think you got what it takes. Do you?
4963	J.D.	I didn't think so.
4964	J.D.	You can stare at me all you want, I'm still not gonna feel bad about what I said to Josh.
4965	J.D.	You don't scare me, woman!

4988	Carla	Hey, Laverne, what'd you first say about J.D. when he started working here?
4989	Nurse Roberts	That he was the most incompetent young doctor I ever worked with.
4990	J.D.	It's not my fault he failed.
4991	Carla	He didn't fail you did. You're supposed to be his teacher.

4998	Lady	No.
4999	Dr. Cox	Good. See? I'm fine over here.
5000	Turk	Okay. You know how men are always talkin' about themselves, right? Well, apparently, women like to talk about themselves even more.
5001	Dr. Cox	Well, thank you, Sensei, you've touched me deeply.
5002	Turk	Okay, you can be cynical if you want, but I'm telling you the honest-to-goodness truth if you get Kristen to talk about herself, it's on. It's on and poppin'. And if that doesn't work, you just simply do what I do.
5003	Dr. Cox	Which is what, exactly?
5004	Turk	Show a little booty!

5011	Philip	From now on, whenever you're wondering whether or not I'll do something, just ask yourself, "Where's the fun?" I think it'll be a time-saver for both of us.
5012	Elliot	You know what's sad? I'm betting that if you were really honest with yourself, you'd realize how unsatisfying it is to ride through life on your father's coattails.

5054	Dr. Cox	Newbie, the only way you could be less productive right now is if you were, in fact, the wall on which you're leaning against. Of course, then you'd be providing some jackass with a wall on which to lean against and reflect on what a jackass he truly is. I know! Here, it's a conundrum. But don't you worry about it I'll tackle that one right upstairs . In the meantime, you could at least pretend to be doing some work. And right about now, even though you don't have your basket, aw, it's just a terrific time for you to skip away, Shirley. Skip away. Skip away. Go on. Skip away.

5061	Philip	I don't wanna. But, if you've got a problem with that, go-go see my father.
5062	Elliot	I think I'll do that.

5072	Kristen	Why are you washing your hands?
5073	Dr. Cox	I don't honestly know, to tell you the truth. I'm I guess it's 'cause I don't have anything of interest to say.
5074	Turk	You got nothing to worry about, 'cause I got something to say. Dr. Cox, you are an attending; so you should know that it is highly inappropriate for you to be sniffing around this woman all day long!
5075	Turk	And you! You are a med student who should be learning from me, but every time I turn around, you're talking to him. So I'm telling you right now, I forbid you to get involved with that guy.
5076	Kristen	Sorry, doctor.
5077	Dr. Cox	You do...realize, of course, that you just effectively signed your own death warrant.

5107	Kristen	Cheers.
5108	Kristen	This is fun.
5109	Dr. Cox	I love the part right before we start hating each other.
5110	Kristen	Oh, really....
5111	Dr. Cox	You wanna know something?
5112	Kristen	What?
5113	Dr. Cox	I feel like I'm using you to get past another person.
5114	Kristen	That's not as sexy as you think it is.
5115	Dr. Cox	It's this nurse....
5116	Dr. Cox	This unavailable nurse! I swear....
5117	Kristen	Ahh....
5118	Dr. Cox	Look, Kristen...
5119	Dr. Cox	I think you're great. But this whole thing's just not fair to you.
5120	Kristen	Yeah.
5121	Kristen	If it's okay with you, I think I'll go ahead and decide what's fair to me.
5122	Dr. Cox	That works for everybody.
5123	Kristen	Perry....
5124	Dr. Cox	Actually, I prefer 'Dr. Cox'.
5125	Kristen	You like strong women, don't you?
5126	Dr. Cox	Are you kiddin' me? They're the only ones I let ruin my life.
5127	Kristen	This is way too easy.
5128	Dr. Cox	Oh, baby; bring it on!
5129	Kristen	Stop talking.

5132	Philip	Dr. Reid, I wrote out your admission orders, and I got the blood cultures that you wanted.
5133	Elliot	Good. Now beat it I'm eating.
5134	Carla	Elliot, you ball-buster!
5135	Elliot	I know, isn't it great!
5136	J.D.'s Narration	I think a lot of us get freaked out when med students come because it feels like being forced to accept new people into your family.
5137	J.D.'s Narration	It changes everything. Me, I was more struck by how these "newbies" made me look at myself....

5147	Elliot	Can I trade clipboards with you?
5148	Elliot	Okay fine... but mine's better ...
5149	Jerry	You wanna trade?
5150	Elliot	I guess.
5151	J.D.	Elliot, have you seen my clipboard?
5152	Elliot	No. Nope. Oh, this'll be fun. J.D., I would like you to meet, J.D.
5153	J.D.	How's it going, man?
5154	Jerry	Make him leave.
5155	J.D.	Are you bummed out that we have the same name?
5156	J.D.	Oh, don't don't worry about it, man; I'll tell you what you're a little bit older than I am, so you were J.D. first. So how about you'll be J.D. Number One, and I'll just be J.D. Number Two. How about that?
5157	Jerry	Hey Number Two.
5158	J.D.	Hey Number One. So, uh, I've got one more patient, do you want to have lunch in ten minutes and you can bring my clipboard?
5159	Elliot	Yeah.
5160	J.D.	Okay.
5161	Jerry	Hey, Number Two!
5162	J.D.	Number One!
5163	J.D.	All right, cool.
5164	Jerry	Hey, Number Two!
5165	J.D.	Number One!
5166	J.D.'s Narration	I honestly think the best part about working here is the patients. When they see how much you care, they're always grateful.
5167	Mr. Simon	About time. Idiot.
5168	J.D.	Okay, Mr. Simon. Good morning, how you feeling?
5169	Mr. Simon	I was just asking Nurse Fajita here if you guys get extra points for asking stupid questions.
5170	J.D.	No, sir, I was just trying to assess how you're
5171	Carla	Bambi. Don't bother.
5172	J.D.	Carla, please. Sir, if there's anything I can do to make your stay here more comfortable
5173	Mr. Simon	You can kiss my man-sized ass!
5174	J.D.	Okay. Will you hold me after?
5175	J.D.	Maybe we shouldn't bother.

5180	Carla	Hey Bambi, you know Mr. Simon made one of the night nurses cry?
5181	J.D.	Which one?
5182	Carla	Frank.
5183	J.D.	Frank used to be a Navy SEAL.
5184	Jerry	Hey, Number Two!
5185	J.D.	Hey, Number One.
5186	Kristen	You are a brave man. You're an attending here and not only you're dating a med student, you're holding hands with her in public.
5187	Dr. Cox	Well, normally I would never do this, but there are mitigating factors.
5188	Kristen	Like what?
5189	Dr. Cox	Well, for starters, you are very hot.
5190	Kristen	Listen, I have kind of a special evening planned for us. I'm not going to give away everything, but I will say it involves wine, an amazing dinner, and a safety word we've agreed upon in advance.
5191	Dr. Cox	God, you are going to make a great mom.

5193	Turk	I told you what to do if the stitches on your chest start to itch.
5194	Mr. Sloane	Don't scratch.
5195	Turk	Unless they're really itchy. Then you go to town, you go nuts, you do your thing.
5196	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Reid, one of the nurses found your stethoscope in the bathroom.
5197	Elliot	Oh, thank you so much, sir
5198	Dr. Kelso	This isn't it, sweetheart. I had them leave yours where it was. Let's try to be a little more responsible, shall we?
5199	Mr. Sloane	I think I went to college with that guy.
5200	Elliot	Oh, lucky you.
5201	Mr. Sloane	Used to play his guitar every Saturday night at this coffee house off-campus.
5202	Turk	Remember the guy's name?
5203	Mr. Sloane	Oh...Robbie, something, I think.
5204	Elliot	You know, Dr. Kelso's name is Bob, which is short for Robert, and Robbie is another nickname for Robert!
5205	Turk	Like, oh, my God!
5206	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
5207	J.D.	Just give Mr. Simon thirty milligrams of MS Contin. I don't understand why I have to come with you.
5208	Carla	Because, Bambi, you're kind of like a doctor. Now come on, he's just another patient.
5209	J.D.	Simon says "Hello"!
5210	Mr. Simon	What the hell do you want?
5211	J.D.	Just going to have Carla here give you a little stronger pain medication.

5222	Dr. Cox	Hey, Kristen, slow down!
5223	Kristen	You have no idea how many times you're going to say that tonight.
5224	Dr. Cox	Boy, you're making it hard.
5225	Kristen	You're going to say that, too.
5226	Dr. Cox	Kristen, look, something has come up and I'm not going to be able to make it tonight.
5227	Kristen	What?
5228	Dr. Cox	I know, I know, I'm sorry. But it's important. It's _very_ important.

5230	Carla	So thank you so much for giving me a ride to pick up my new dresser.
5231	Dr. Cox	Please, you know I love doing favors.
5232	Carla	You hate doing favors.
5233	Dr. Cox	But I like doing them for you, that's a fact. Now listen, even though I am in the best shape of my life and I am, by the way...I mean, fact of the matter is you could pretty much bounce a damn quarter off my butt, you know, if you...if you wanted to.
5234	Carla	I...don't have any change.
5235	Dr. Cox	Anyway, uh, I'm probably going to need your help getting the dresser up on the roof here.
5236	Carla	Oh, I'm sure you guys can handle it.
5237	Dr. Cox	Uh, I beg your pardon.

5242	Turk	Hey. You know that dresser I got for Carla yesterday? It's not for her place, it's for mine. Is she moving in? No-one asked me.
5243	Turk	What the hell is this crap?
5244	Elliot	It's Dr. Kelso! Mr. Sloane dropped the tape off.
5245	Turk	Why do you care so much, anyway?
5246	Elliot	I mean, I think it would be so interesting if there was this whole, like, romantic, creative, vulnerable side to him.
5247	Elliot	I think it's a fascinating study of human behaviour.
5248	Turk	I think you're a fascinating study of human behaviour.
5249	Elliot	The music's not that bad.
5250	Singer	"You played a part/sweet Bunny/you broke my Tuscaloosa heart..."
5251	Turk	"My Tuscaloosa heart"?
5252	Elliot	You have to admit, if that was him, it'd be pretty weird.
5253	Turk	You have to admit, you're pretty weird.
5254	Elliot	Stop doing that!

5257	J.D.'s Thoughts	Ahh, Mr. Simon's room.
5258	Carla	You don't have to hide from Mr. Simon.
5259	J.D.	I'm not hiding from Mr. Simon, I have a new exercise program; it's called 'Short Bursts'.
5260	Carla	Mmm, is it working?
5261	J.D.	Do you have to ask?
5262	Carla	Yeah.
5263	J.D.	Huh. Where did Mr. Simon go?
5264	Carla	Well, I'm guessing not heaven. He died.
5265	Jerry	Hey, Number Two!
5266	J.D.	Hey, Number One. What happened?
5267	Carla	Bambi, he had terminal metastatic colon cancer, he went into respiratory arrest and passed away.
5268	Jerry	Hey, Number Two!
5269	J.D.	Hey, Number One. Did you give him a dose of naloxone?
5270	Bambi	Yes, Bambi, we tried intubating him, we did CPR, we even tried transcutaneous pacing.
5271	Jerry	Hey, Number Two!
5272	J.D.	He went so fast.
5273	Carla	Yeah. Say "Hey, Number One".

5278	Dr. Cox	You are a stupid, stupid man.
5279	Jordan	Hey honey, I'm home. You know, you should lock your door, there's horrible people out there.
5280	Dr. Cox	There's horrible people right in here.
5281	Jordan	Maybe you forgot how this works. See, when I say that "Hi honey" thing, you take your pants off. See, thems the rules of the booty call.
5282	Dr. Cox	Jordan, believe me, I enjoy our meaningless post-divorce sex as much as the next guy you marry will, but your timing cou-hould not be worse.
5283	Jordan	Oh, maybe you don't remember the terms of our settlement. When Jordan needs sex, Jordan gets sex.
5284	Dr. Cox	Listen, Sweetcheeks, I am seeing someone who
5285	Jordan	Let me guess, let me guess dark haired, domineering, doesn't take any of your crap? You see, a lesser person would mock your inability to move on. I'm going to consider it an homage.
5286	Dr. Cox	There is something so... soft about you.
5287	Jordan	Yeah.
5288	Dr. Cox	Look, I am seeing someone right now who, by the way, is great and yet there's this other woman who I cannot get out of my head. She's totally unavailable, which may be why I can't get her out of my head; and _maybe_ and this is a whole new theory I keep thinking of this other woman the unavailable one because I am so afraid that the first thing might actually work out; and God forbid I ever do something that might actually make _me_ happy. Do you have any idea what I'm talking about?
5289	Jordan	Oh my God. If I have to stay here and listen to this crap, I'll need a stronger drink.
5290	Dr. Cox	I hate you.
5291	Jordan	I hate you, too, honey.
5292	Dr. Cox	Fair enough.

5298	Elliot	I really think it was him.
5299	Turk	It wasn't.
5300	Elliot	Yeah, but what if it was?
5301	Turk	Oh, good Lord, woman.
5302	Dr. Kelso	Having a late-night tea party, are we? Oh, I guess my invitation must have been lost in the mail. Well, as long as I'm here, I'm partial to Lemon Zinger.
5303	Elliot	Sir, the reason Dr. Turk is here is because his patient is going into surgery tomorrow; but I was kind of hoping we could do an ERCP first?
5304	Dr. Kelso	Ahh, you're breaking my Tuscaloosa heart. Just turf him.
5305	Elliot	"Tuscaloosa heart", hmm? Um, this is what I like to call my 'Told-You-So Dance'.

5312	Carla	Not now, maybe in the morning before work...
5313	J.D.	Just thought I'd talk to you guys.
5314	Turk	J.D., when you were a kid, did you used to walk into your parent's room in the middle of the night?
5315	Young J.D.	Mommy, are you and Daddy playing wheelbarrow?
5316	J.D.'s Dad	Son, you go back to bed, I'm fixing Mommy's back.
5317	J.D.	Yes, once.
5318	Carla	Turk, you're not being very sensitive.
5319	Turk	I'll be sensitive at breakfast, baby. Turk out.
5320	Carla	What's up, Bambi?
5321	J.D.	I just can't stop thinking about Mr. Simon. I neglected him because he was such a jerk; and I'm just kinda worried that's what killed him.
5322	Carla	Well, could have been the neglect. Could have been the terminal cancer. Bambi, you're a conscientious doctor, you'd never do anything to hurt a patient, you know that.
5323	J.D.	You're right. Argh...thank you, Carla.
5324	Carla	Mmm-hmm.
5325	J.D.	Peace out, Turk!

5335	J.D.'s Narration	And most importantly, it's the place where you can let everything go and finally just sleep...

5338	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, so you got a good eight, nine minutes of sleep last night. Just remember it's a new day; yesterday's gone and it's never coming back.
5339	Carla	Bambi. About yesterday.
5340	J.D.	It's back?
5341	Carla	Uh, they want you to present Mr. Simon at a M and M conference this afternoon.
5342	J.D.'s Narration	Morbidity and Mortality conferences are just fun little meetings they have when they think you may be in any way responsible for a patient's death.
5343	Carla	Bambi. Don't be nervous.
5344	J.D.	Is it hot in here? It's, like, it's hot!
5345	J.D.	No, I'm fine.
5346	Bambi	Okay.

5361	Dr. Cox	Listen, I I gotta say something to you here, you, uh... you are so great. You know, you're sexy, you're smart; God knows you're dangerous.
5362	Kristen	Do you think I'm a spy?
5363	Dr. Cox	No. Look, I just want you to know that I haven't been in this relationship a hundred percent, and it's because of how great you are and just exactly how much that scares me. But from now on, if you want... sister, you're going to be getting the whole shebang. 'Cause I'm all in, baby.

5368	Turk	That's because it's physically impossible to write a love song about anyone named "Enid".
5369	Elliot	Turk, don't you get it? This tape shows exactly why Kelso is... Kelso! I mean, he he used to be this beautiful, wonderful, sweet, caring man; he he found the love of his life and somehow she slipped through his hands.
5370	Carla	Oh, that is so sad.
5371	Turk	Have you guys ever stopped to think that maybe Bunny is just a real bunny.

5376	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Dorian, we have examined Aaron Simon's file. Before we begin, do you have any last words?
5377	J.D.	I'm a kay? That was terrible; can I have a do-over?
5378	Dr. Kelso	Initially there were concerns that Mr. Simon may have been over-medicated. We have concluded that his pain control was both adequate and well within normal limits. Thank you for stopping by.
5379	J.D.	Actually, Sir, I I'm not sure how this whole thing usually works, but I was kinda hoping we could take a closer look at me.
5380	J.D.	I've been sorta doubting my performance, and it would it would be really helpful if we could all talk about it. As a group.
5381	J.D.'s Narration	Bottom line, Dr. Kelso isn't looking to do me any favors. If I did something wrong, he'd call me on it...

5384	Dr. Cox	Oh, joy.

5387	Jordan	No way, same here.
5388	Kristen	Really?
5389	Jordan	Yeah.
5390	Dr. Cox	Ohh-kay, this is beyond horrible.
5391	Jordan	Would you relax, Perry, I just came by for a board meeting and I wanted to meet the new lady in your life... and warn her.
5392	Kristen	Thank you.
5393	Jordan	You're welcome.
5394	Dr. Cox	Kristen... this is my emotional baggage. Baggage... Kristen.
5395	Kristen	Ohh, be nice.
5396	Carla	Hey, um, I just wanted to thank you again for helping me move that dresser last night.
5397	Dr. Cox	Oh, sure, no problem.
5398	Carla	Thank you. He's a great guy.
5399	Dr. Cox	See ya.
5400	Carla	Oh. Bye.
5401	Kristen	That's why you blew me off?
5402	Jordan	Oh, I should leave.
5403	Kristen	Moving furniture with that nurse you have a crush on. That's your "hundred percent"?
5404	Dr. Cox	No no, no no, the hundred percent actually came well after that. Look, her boyfriend was there the entire time, and if you want to know the truth, bailing on you is far and away the best thing that could have happened because it made me realise that I was sabotaging myself again. What, if you don't believe me, ask Jordan. Would you please tell her what I said to you right before you left this morning.
5405	Kristen	Left where?
5406	Dr. Cox	Uhh... um... uh...
5407	Kristen	You're unbelievable.
5408	Jordan	That's too bad, I liked her.

5412	Elliot	Why don't we just say something to him?
5413	Turk	Like what?
5414	Elliot	I don't know... I heard some of your songs and I think they're extraordinary.
5415	Turk	Elliot, don't.
5416	Elliot	I won't.
5417	Turk	Pinky swear.
5418	Elliot	I heard some of your songs and I think they're extraordinary!
5419	Dr. Kelso	Excuse me?
5420	Turk	You swore!
5421	Elliot	You know what, um, just forget it. We won't bother you anymore.
5422	Turk	Sir... whatever happened to Bunny? We gotta know.
5423	Dr. Kelso	Well, actually, the music came before Bunny. I learned to play the guitar growing up as a young rapscallion in Mississippi; but things didn't really take off until I moved to Memphis. Then I met the Colonel, and the hits just kept coming! Unfortunately, it went to my head, I gained a lot of weight, started wearing a white jumpsuit and ate tranquilizers like they were trailmix.
5424	Elliot	Sir
5425	Dr. Kelso	Then, in 1977, I died on the toilet... Or did I?
5426	Turk	You never played the guitar, did you?
5427	Kelso	Son, that crap is for hippies. Now for God's sake, get back to work!
5428	Elliot	Yes sir.
5429	Kelso	Thank you very much.

5431	J.D.'s Thoughts	Ultimately, I always turn to the person I trust the most. Because I know when he looks me in the eye and says I didn't do anything wrong, I'll actually believe it.
5432	Dr. Cox	Yep, looks like you screwed the pooch there, Tinkerbell.
5433	J.D.	But I didn't overmedicate him!
5434	Dr. Cox	Of course you didn't, and I always check your orders after you make them. But if you're wondering whether or not you treated Mr. Simon differently because he's a complete jerk, well... I think you know the answer to that one already, don't you?
5435	J.D.	Depends what you mean by different, I
5436	Dr. Cox	I have to warn you, I just got dumped in front of my ex-wife not ten minutes ago, okay Betty? It's always easy to treat the nice ones nice, isn't it?
5437	J.D.	Uh huh.
5438	Dr. Cox	But your drug addicts, your child abusers, your garden-variety jerks... Man.
5439	J.D.	You know, it's, uh it's barely misting out...
5440	Dr. Cox	It's my hair, if it even gets damp, it frizzes out and becomes wildly unmanageable.
5441	J.D.	Mine too!
5442	Dr. Cox	It was a joke, you girl.
5443	Dr. Cox	Lookit, Newbie, the only way to judge your growth as a doctor hell, as a human being is by making sure you don't repeat the same mistakes over and over.
5444	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
5445	Jordan	That was really great and all, but next time would you do me a favour and not look at me in the eye, it really gets in the way of what I come here to do.
5446	Dr. Cox	Then, for God's sake, stop turning around!
5447	Jordan	Oh, that's classy.
5448	Dr. Cox	No, wait a minute you don't have to go... you know, if... if you don't want to.
5449	Jordan	Oh my God, are you really that lonely?
5450	Dr. Cox	Kinda, yeah.
5451	Jordan	All right, I'll toss you a quickie, but no talking.
5452	Dr. Cox	I'll talk if I want to, you know!
5453	Jordan	Yeah, be quiet!

5455	J.D.'s Narration	The worst part of being a doctor is that you fall short a lot. The best part is that if you wait around for a few seconds, you'll get a chance to redeem yourself.
5456	Jerry	Hey, Number Two!
5457	J.D.	Hey, Number One. How you doing, man?
5458	J.D.'s Narration	I guess there's good and bad in all of us.

5462	Dr. Kelso	Hey, Bunny! No, I forgot Yeah no Yeah, I'll I'll do it as soon as I get home. Well, I'm sor Yeah...well, I guess hanging up on me is the right thing to do.

5472	Open	Hospital - Admissions Area - Day
5473	J.D.'s Narration	So, here’s the deal: A month ago, Turk and Elliot wrote a paper on peripheral vascular disease. And now they’re upset because they have to present it at a big medical conference.
5474	J.D.	Do you know how many interns would die to do something like that? Not me, ‘cause I don’t really care about that stuff. Besides, I know in my heart my paper was, like, a trillion times better. And anyway, it’s so political I mean, surprise, surprise, they went with the black guy and the girl!
5475	Carla	Bambi.
5476	J.D.	What!?
5477	Carla	Mm-mm. Mm-mm.
5478	J.D.	Come on, what right do they have to be so damn mopey?
5479	J.D.'s Narration	And that’s when Elliot said something that explained everything.
5480	Elliot	Our parents are coming.
5481	J.D.	Oh, I am so sorry.
5482	J.D.'s Narration	I could tell my friends were pretty upset. Still, there was a bright side....
5483	J.D.	It’s all right.
5484	J.D.'s Narration	...I knew I could make it worse.
5485	J.D.	You missed a spot!
5486	Turk	You know, you can help. You can't even hear the television!
5487	J.D.	I like the pictures.
5488	J.D. Narration	If I believed in karma, I might be a little more cautious about giving these guys a hard time...
5489	J.D.	Hey, Dad. No, no, nothing. Turk and Elliot are freaking out because their parents are coming to visit.
5490	J.D. Narration	But karma doesn't scare me!
5491	J.D.	No, no, no, no, it hasn't been that long since you and I saw each other.
5492	J.D.	Dad...
5493	Turk	Hey, Mr. Dorian!
5494	Mr. Dorian	Hey, boys. What's shakin'? Who needs a beer?
5495	Turk	Who doesn't?
5496	Turk	See, J.D., this is what goes around. And this? Is what comes around.
5497	Mr. Dorian	Only two left!
5498	Turk	That's okay. J.D.'ll go out.
5499	Mr. Dorian	Oh, get some chips!
5500	Mr. Dorian	Wowzer! Rowdy's a boy dog.
5501	J.D. Narration	My mom and dad got divorced when I was seven. I know that's not so unusual but even though everyone's relationship with their father seems different, mine always seemed *very* different.
5502	Mr. Dorian	God, I'd like to take a run at her. Would you take a look at her rack?
5503	J.D.	Dad, please!
5504	Mr. Dorian	I'm sorry, Johnny. I'm just a man. And you know what they say about men.
5505	Turk	They love the boobies.
5506	Mr. Dorian	That is correct, Christopher.
5507	J.D.	Okay, you know, I think I'm going to hit the sack before I get even more uncomfortable.
5508	Mr. Dorian	You know, your mother had a beautiful bosom.
5509	J.D.	There it is!
5510	Mr. Dorian	Sit, would you? Stay. We've got a lot of catching up to do. Please. Do you guys have a policy on farting?
5511	Turk	No, let 'er rip.
5512	Mr. Dorian	Fire in the hole!
5513	J.D.	Oh, my God! Dad!
5514	Turk	Count it!
5515	J.D.	That was a nice moment.
5516	J.D. Narration	I guess everyone's parents drive them crazy.
5517	Elliot	So, this is my hospital.
5518	Dr. Reid	It's... stunning.
5519	Mrs. Reid	Honey, is there a rule against looking pretty here?
5520	Elliot	Uh, nothing official.
5521	Ms. Turk	I just think you would look so much more handsome in blue scrubs.
5522	Turk	Thank you, Mommy, but I really like my green scrubs better.
5523	Ms. Turk	Mmm-hmmm.
5524	J.D. Narration	Parents have a way of making their children regress.
5525	Young Turk	I don't wanna wear blue scrubs!
5526	Ms. Turk	C'mon, boy, you better watch your manners! Come on now!
5527	Young Elliot	Wahhhhhh!
5528	Mrs. Reid	No, you can't have one, sweetheart! Perms are for trailer trash!
5529	Dr. Cox	What in the hell is this? Parents weekend?
5530	J.D.	Well, sort of. Elliot and Turk wrote this paper and then my dad decided "I want to come, too!"
5531	Dr. Cox	Look, Reba, if I ask you a question that doesn't specifically deal with a medical issue, you can bet your powdered bottom that I don't want you to answer. Do you understand?
5532	J.D.	Yeah...
5533	Dr. Cox	It's like... working with a monkey!
5534	J.D.	Ooo! Ooo!
5535	Dr. Cox	What?
5536	J.D.	Nothing.
5537	Carla	Why didn't you introduce me to your mother this morning?
5538	Turk	Because she just came by to say hey before she checked into her hotel. Besides, she's coming back later on to look around.
5539	Carla	Okay. I was worried that you thought she might not like me.
5540	Turk	She's not going to like you. Baby, look, my mother's never actually called any girl I've been with by her actual name. Hell, she called my college girlfriend "The Big Easy".
5541	Carla	Well, was she fat and slutty?
5542	Turk	She had beautiful skin. Don't smile, woman. She did. Just beautiful.
5543	Elliot	So, what do you guys think?
5544	Mrs. Reid	Well, I think it's time to get back to the suite and get me into a bath. This place makes me feel dirty.
5545	Elliot	Dr. Kelso, Dr. Kelso! Uh, these are my parents.
5546	Dr. Kelso	Ah, well, it's always a pleasure to meet the trees from which our little acorns fall. Bob Kelso.
5547	Dr. Reid	Simon Reid. I'm Chief of Medicine at St. Augustine's. It's a private hospital in Greenwhich.
5548	Mrs. Reid	I know what you're thinking. You didn't ask. Nobody ever does.
5549	Elliot	So, uh, how long are you guys staying?
5550	J.D.	Can I help you, sir? Sir?
5551	Man	You can help me by minding your own damn business!
5552	J.D.	Excuse me?
5553	Man	Oh, aggressive, huh? Do you really want to get it on with me, Pipsqueak? Because if you do, I guarantee it'll be the last stupid thing you ever do on God's green earth.
5554	J.D.	Nice meeting you.
5555	J.D. Thoughts	What the hell was that about?
5556	Janitor	Dad! Don't wander off like that.
5557	Dr. Cox	This is your basic arthrocentesis, there, Newbie. Your resident should've showed you how to do this a long time ago.
5558	J.D.'s Thoughts	He can't be that mad. We both know that even though residents are supposed to teach you, they really only show up when they want something.
5559	Dr. Steadman	Hey, I have to give the med students a lecture on heart murmurs tomorrow. Could you cover for me?
5560	J.D.	Actually, I
5561	Dr. Steadman	Thanks, man.
5562	J.D.	That sucks. I totally wanted to spend some time with my dad tomorrow.
5563	Dr. Cox	Then take him?
5564	J.D.	What do you mean?
5565	Dr. Cox	Uh, I don't know, secure a vehicle of some kind car, balloon, tricycle and transport your father from wherever he is to where you're going to be.
5566	J.D.	I don't I don't think you really get my dad. He's not really interested in my work. He's more like a buddy.
5567	Dr. Cox	Ohhh-kay, that was my mistake. Here I engaged you and gave you the impression that I actually care which is just so wrong! God!
5568	J.D.	The thing is, I don't really need a buddy. What I need is a father.
5569	Dr. Cox	Well, you definitely need something. Um, maybe a backbone, or perhaps some testicles. At the very least, a pillow that you could carry around the hospital and just cry your sad eyes out into whenever drama occures.
5570	J.D.	I have testicles.
5571	J.D.	He's he's a kidder! Heh.
5572	Turk	All right, this is it. You just brace yourself and let me handle this all nice and smooth like. All right? Hey, Mom! Guess what?
5573	Carla	Hi, Mrs. Turk. I'm gonna cut right to the chase. I'm Carla, and I apologize if your son hasn't told you about me yet. Honestly, I don't know how you put up with him as long as you did. Still, you should know he loves me very much, I feel the same way, and we're really, really good together.
5574	Mrs. Turk	Are you two sharing a bed?
5575	Turk	Noooo!
5576	Carla	Yes, ma'am, we are, but if you're a good judge of character, I think you can tell, I'm not messing around.
5577	Mrs. Turk	Carla. That's a nice name.
5578	Carla	Thank you.
5579	Turk	Listen, it is, Mother Mrs. Turk: Oh, please! Not telling me about her. Dear, do me a favor. Don't give him any for a month or so.
5580	Carla	Done!
5581	Turk	No, it can't go down like that! It just can't go down like that!
5582	Dr. Kelso	After you, sir.
5583	Dr. Reid	Well, I'll be. I haven't seen a ward like this since Vietnam.
5584	Dr. Kelso	So where in Connecticut was your National Guard unit stationed?
5585	Dr. Reid	Amusing.
5586	Dr. Kelso	I thought so.
5587	Elliot	I think they're totally getting along, don't you?
5588	Dr. Reid	I'm about to open a big fat can of whoop ass on you!
5589	Dr. Kelso	Bring it on, bitch!
5590	Dr. Kelso	All right, sports fans! We have a guest today at rounds so let's try and be sharp. Why don't we begin with, uh... I don't know... Dr. Reid! What is the nutritional cause of high output cardiac failure?
5591	Elliot	Wet beriberi from thiamine deficiency?
5592	Dr. Kelso	Yes, it is. Next question. Why don't we try, um... Dr. Reid!
5593	Elliot	Um, I already went, sir.
5594	Dr. Kelso	Oh, are you done for the day?
5595	Elliot	No.
5596	Dr. Kelso	What is the mechanism of cheyne-stokes respiration in systolic dysfunction?
5597	J.D.'s Thoughts	What? Nobody knows that.
5598	Elliot	Prolongation of circulation time from the lung to the brain, causing diminished sensitivity of the respiratorcenter to arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide?
5599	Dr. Kelso	Yes.
5600	Elliot	Can you believe my dad winked at me?
5601	J.D.	If that's not saying, "I love you and I'm proud of you," I'm not really sure what is.
5602	Elliot	I know! Lemme tell ya, there are no gratuitous winks in the Reid household. It's like...
5603	J.D.'s Narration	And that's when I decided to take a chance.
5604	Mr. Dorian	Are you kidding? I'd love to come to your heart murmur lecture! I'm a big fan of those things!
5605	J.D.	That means a lot, Dad.
5606	Mr. Dorian	Yeah, absolutely.
5607	Dr. Cox	Oh, dear Lord, please make it stop.
5608	Carla	It's absolutely stunning.
5609	Ms. Turk	Thank you. And I understand you make them.
5610	Carla	Yes, I make them. I'd be happy to make...
5611	Turk	Look at them. Like two wolves gabbing about which sheep to eat. Unfortunately for them, I'm a man.
5612	Carla	Turk!
5613	Turk	Coming!
5614	Carla	Thank you.
5615	J.D.	Hi, Ms. Turk.
5616	Ms. Turk	John Dorian, get over here.
5617	J.D.	Well, uhh, umm...
5618	Ms. Turk	After all these years, are you still afraid of me?
5619	J.D.	Well, remember on Thanksgiving when I said your turkey was dry and you picked me up and shook me?
5620	Ms. Turk	Well, then, don't say that.
5621	Carla	Silly Bambi.
5622	Turk	Okay, you guys, leave him alone. And I've had enough of you two conspiring and whatnot. It ends now!
5623	Ms. Turk	It is so cute when he thinks he's in charge.
5624	Carla	I know! It kills me!
5625	J.D. Narration	And that's when it happened.
5626	Carla	You should see him prance around when I pretend to let him
5627	Both	Make a decision!
5628	J.D. Narration	That's when Carla realized she was exactly like Turk's mom.
5629	Dr. Kelso	Great job at rounds today, Dr. Reid.
5630	Elliot	Thank you, sir!
5631	Dr. Kelso	Your dad must have been very impressed.
5632	Elliot	I think so. I could tell that he really respected you, sir.
5633	Dr. Kelso	Well, that's very nice, but lucky for me, my self-esteem isn't tied up in that kind of poppycock. You see, I didn't become a doctor to impress my daddy, or anyone else. I did it for me. I've seen lots of doctors who got into this for the wrong reasons. You know what happens to them?
5634	Elliot	No...
5635	Dr. Kelso	They quit and get their real estate license. You look upset, sweetheart. You shouldn't be. I think you'd look super in a gold blazer.
5636	Elliot	Thank you?
5637	Dr. Kelso	This is almost too easy.
5638	Mr. Dorian	Work is great, Johnny. I like to believe that I'm selling dreams.
5639	J.D.	But Dad, you sell office supplies.
5640	Mr. Dorian	Yeah, I prefer to call them dreams. I'm gonna-I'm gonna steal another Jell-o.
5641	J.D. Narration	I always thought parents were like tornadoes.
5642	J.D. Narration	They blow into town and devastate everything in their path.
5643	Elliot	Hi...
5644	J.D.	There's no food on your tray.
5645	Elliot	Oh.
5646	J.D. Narration	But it's different for me.
5647	Mr. Dorian	How you doin', Elliot?
5648	Mr. Dorian	Great talk. Uh, anyway, Johnny, I was talking to my buddy Jake this afternoon. You remember my buddy Jake?
5649	J.D.	No.
5650	Mr. Dorian	Well, anwyay, Jake's my buddy and he's leaving the country for who knows how long so I thought I might get out of here tomorrow afternoon and go catch up with him which would mean I'd miss your thing but I wouldn't know what I was hearing anyway. Right?
5651	J.D.	Right!
5652	J.D. Narration	I think what surprised me the most was that I was actually surprised.
5653	Mr. Dorian	You still talking to yourself? I thought you'd outgrow that by now.
5654	J.D. Narration	I probably should have woken him up to say good-bye, considering he'd be gone before I got home. I told myself I wanted to let the old guy get some sleep but even I didn't believe that.
5655	Mrs. Reid	Honey, you keep eating that, there won't be anything left for a man to put a ring on.
5656	Elliot	Mom, I started therapy.
5657	Mrs. Reid	Did you know that Amy Swanson married Drew Gertson? Drew is such a nice boy.
5658	Elliot	Drew used to hold people down and spit into their mouths.
5659	Mrs. Reid	He doesn't do that anymore.
5660	Elliot	Mom, when I was a little girl, did I used to want to be a doctor? Maybe I used a toy stethoscope on one of my dolls?
5661	Mrs. Reid	Oh, honey. You'd have to ask the nanny.
5662	Elliot	Have you ever reached a point in your life when you just really wished you knew how you got there?
5663	Mrs. Reid	Are you trying to tell me you're a lesbian?
5664	Elliot	Yes, I am. Yup. Exactly. Exactly what I'm saying, Mom.
5665	Turk	Yo, J.D., you wanna grab a bite with us tonight after Elliot and I do our presentation?
5666	J.D.	Yeah, I'm not that busy.
5667	Dr. Steadman	Well, if you're not that busy, then you have time to do this discharge summary for me.
5668	J.D.	I meant that later I'm not that busy
5669	Dr. Steadman	Fantastic!
5670	J.D.	Arrrrgh!
5671	Turk	So I told my mom how much you liked that Cuban restaurant downtown and she loves cuban food, so
5672	Carla	I hate that restaurant!
5673	Turk	Wow. So I must have really misunderstood when you said that you loved that place and you wanted to be buried in a vat of their plantains so you could eat you way out.
5674	Carla	See? That's our problem. You don't get me!
5675	Turk	No argument there!
5676	Janitor's father	Hey, hey, hey, hey! You missed a spot right there!
5677	Janitor	You know, lucky for me, Dad, I spend my life making a big circle around this place cleaning up after sick people so tomorrow I'll probably be here around the same time.
5678	Janitor's father	You know that I hate sass! So just drop right down and give me twenty.
5679	Janitor	Dad, that could be fecal matter.
5680	Janitor's father	Make it thirty!
5681	Janitor	Fine.
5682	Janitor	One...
5683	J.D. Narration	What is with parents anyway? Why is it so easy for them to make us feel bad?
5684	Janitor	Three...
5685	Janitor's father	Sound off like you've got a pair!
5686	Janitor	Dad, I don't gotta put up with this
5687	Dr. Cox	Now, you've got to at least try and pace yourself, Newbie, otherwise sure as shootin' you're going to burn out. Come.
5688	Dr. Cox	Oh, I heard the sad sigh, I see your shoulders are slumped, and I'm aware that you have some whiny-ass problem that you want to talk to me about because you probably think it'd be cathartic to get it the hell off your chest but believe me it won't be. What you've got to do, for me, is the healthy thing. Keep all of your feelings bottled up inside where they *so* belong!
5689	J.D.	My dad flaked on me again.
5690	Dr. Cox	I'm sorry, um, you're not on drugs, are you?
5691	J.D.	What? No!
5692	Dr. Cox	Are you in jail? Have you been beaten? Are you malnourished?
5693	J.D.	I skipped lunch but I've been snacking all day.
5694	Dr. Cox	You are, in fact, a perfectly healthy twenty-six-year-old doctor who keeps crying about how horrible his father was.
5695	J.D.	Well, he did some considerable emotional damage, so...
5696	Dr. Cox	Every one of our parents does some considerable emotional damage and from what I've heard it just might be the best part of being a parent. Now, if some guy ever does put a ring on your finger and you're lucky enough to pop out a youngster, I'm sure you'll understand but for now trust me when I tell you that I wouldn't care if today was the first time you ever met your daddy. Because in reality, well, he could have done a much, much worse job. Okay?
5697	Turk	All right, Elliot, at the presentation I was wondering, can I do the ending? Because I really love the ending of our paper.
5698	Elliot	Do you think I'm cut out to be a doctor?
5699	Turk	Okay, fine, you can do the ending. I just want to say, "Thanks, folks! We've been great!"
5700	Elliot	I'm serious. Do you think this is what I really want to do?
5701	Turk	Elliot, I don't know.
5702	Elliot	You can tell me. I can take it.
5703	Turk	No, Elliot, I'm saying I don't know because I really don't know. What the hell is going on here? Why have all women gone crazy?
5704	Elliot	I'm not crazy, am I? No, shhh, it's okay.
5705	Elliot	It's okay, Elliot, you're normal...
5706	Carla	Turk?
5707	Turk	He's not here.
5708	Carla	Turk. I do like that Cuban restaurant.
5709	Turk	Well, I think the important thing is we got through this together.
5710	Carla	I just freaked out because your mom and I have so much in common.
5711	Turk	So?
5712	Carla	I don't know, I got this crazy idea that you only fell for me because I'm just like your mom.
5713	Turk	Aw, baby...
5714	Turk	That's *exactly* why I fell for you.
5715	Carla	Okay, I'll probably just have a friend pick up my stuff...
5716	Turk	No, wait, sit down. What's wrong with wanting to be with someone because they're smart and independent and always looking out for you? Okay?
5717	Carla	Yeah.
5718	Turk	Okay.
5719	Carla	But if we ever get married, we're gonna have to talk about this in therapy.
5720	Turk	Relax. I don't do this with my mama.
5721	Carla	I hope not.
5722	Turk	Oh, yeah, mama!
5723	Carla	Oh, that's just wrong.
5724	Turk	Oh, mama!
5725	J.D. Narration	Part of me thought Cox was wrong and I had every reason to be angry with my father.
5726	Patient	So... how's it going down there?
5727	J.D.	If it's okay with you, we just won't talk right now. Got a needle. Need to focus.
5728	J.D. Narration	But then I stopped thinking of my dad as a father, and started thinking of him as a man. And I realized some things that deep down I probably always knew. Like, maybe he wasn't crashing on my couch to spend more quality time with me but because he couldn't afford a hotel room.
5729	J.D. Narration	And maybe he wasn't going to see his buddy Jake to catch up, but because Jake was someone he might be able to sell something to and he really needs a sale.
5730	J.D. Narration	And maybe the truth is, he's just a middle-aged lonely guy trying to get by and it sure would be nice if someone would give him a break once and a while.
5731	J.D.	Hey, Dad.
5732	Mr. Dorian	Hey, there he is! I thought you had to work all day.
5733	J.D.	You know, I did, but I got someone to cover for me because I wanted to make sure I caught you and let you know how cool it was to see you.
5734	Mr. Dorian	Really?
5735	J.D.	Yeah.
5736	Mr. Dorian	Well... Well, listen, I, um, you know, I have to travel a lot lately so I'm sure I'll be back in this region again soon. I could swing back out to see you.
5737	J.D.	That would be really great.
5738	Mr. Dorian	Great.
5739	J.D.	Great.
5740	Mr. Dorian	Great. I'd be happy to see you.
5741	J.D.	I see you've been taking advantage of the farting policy.
5742	Mr. Dorian	Hey, pull my finger!
5743	J.D.	I'm not gonna pull your finger!
5744	Mr. Dorian	Pull my finger, see what happens.
5745	Mr. Dorian	I pooed a little.
5746	Elliot	Dr. Kelso.
5747	Dr. Kelso	Well, if it isn't daddy's little girl.
5748	Elliot	Dr. Kelso, I just wanted to tell you what happened to me this afternoon.
5749	Dr. Kelso	I'm going to go right ahead and keep eating my soup but you rest assured I'm holding my breath on the inside.
5750	Elliot	First, I came out to my mother.
5751	Dr. Kelso	Well, then it appears the boys down in radiology owe me quite a bit of money.
5752	Elliot	But this afternoon...
5753	Elliot	A patient puked on me... and I smiled.
5754	Elliot	You know why I was smiling? Because I really like what I do. I mean, you were right, I got into this for all the wrong reasons but I lucked out because now that I'm here, I can't imagine being anywhere else.
5755	Dr. Kelso	I still don't like your father!
5756	Elliot	Oh, me neither, sir.
5757	Elliot	Oh, they were all out.
5758	Elliot	Placement of an iliac stent when hemodynamic results of PTA are inadequate or primary stent placement at the initial time of PTA...
5759	J.D. Narration	Maybe the mistake we make is thinking our parents will change.
5760	J.D. Narration	And maybe they did a better job than we give them credit for.
5761	J.D. Narration	And maybe there, amid all the crap they dumped on us, are some things worth keeping. Like a passion for something you never knew you had. Or the ability to constantly surround yourself with people who love you.
5762	Elliot	In conclusion, the difference in the outcome between the two strategies was not significant in either short-term or long-term prognosis.
5763	Turk	Thank you very much, folks. We've been great.
5764	J.D.	And "Z" is for the Zs you'll be getting, now that you know heart murmurs from "A" to "Z."
5765	J.D.	What are you doing here?
5766	Dr. Cox	Yeah, I just figured I'd come down and check it out. You know, see how you were doing. And for the record, that was atrocious. I mean, downright abysmal.
5767	J.D.	I know, but did you see "A" through "K"? 'Cause I did a really cool thing with "A" through "K."
5768	Dr. Cox	Actually, I showed up at "Y." As in, "Why, dear God, why?!"
5769	Janitor's father	You know, this has got to be the most piss-poor sorry excuse for a hospital that I have ever set foot in.
5770	Janitor	Well, Dad, in that case, feel free to not stop by every day that you're in town.
5771	Janitor's father	Good-bye, son.
5772	Janitor's father	See you tomorrow.
5773	Janitor	Yup.
5774	Janitor	Heh, heh. Parents, huh?
5775	J.D.	Tell me about it.
5776	Janitor	Yeah, what's that, a shot at my dad? That's stepping over the line, pal.
5777	J.D.	I missed this.

5779	Turk	Nothing.... Nothing.... Nothing.... Nothing.... Nothing.... Nothing....
5780	J.D.	I can see!
5781	Turk	Nothing.... Nothing.
5782	J.D.	Come on, man, let's get out of here. There's something to do, there's......film festivals, there's theatre, there's museums. Let's get out and get some culture! How 'bout some of that!
5783	Turk	Let's put Rowdy on top of the TV and see which one of us can throw a hat on him first.
5784	J.D.'s Narration	Turk turns everything in to a competition. It can get kind of annoying.
5785	Turk	Let's play Steak.
5786	J.D.	What?
5787	Turk	Steak: The first person to finish their steak is the winner of Steak.
5788	J.D.	No, see, I paid seventeen dollars for this steak, and I'm not gonna....
5789	J.D.	You want some?
5790	Turk	Uh-huh.
5791	Turk	Ankles is a simple game: The first one to get embarrassed and pull up their scrubs loses.
5792	J.D.'s Narration	The problem is, these stupid games always seem to end the same way.
5793	Turk	HA! HahahahaHA! Say it!
5794	Turk	Say it!
5795	Turk	Just say it.
5796	J.D.	I'm your beeyotch.
5797	Turk	Yes, you are! Now, sit back, baby, 'cause 'Iron Chef' is on.
5798	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
5799	Turk	I win!
5800	J.D.	I wasn't racing, I was just walking in.
5801	Todd	Good, clean win, T-Dog. Now, let's go down to the Caf and get our doughnut on.
5802	J.D.	It wasn't a race! Okay, fine! Let's just play, uh, let's play Tip Over the Trash-Can! Okay?
5803	J.D.	I win!
5804	J.D.	I...I win.
5805	Janitor	Can I play?

5810	Elliot	Sorry to keep you, Mr. Kelly, I was just, uh....
5811	Elliot	So, what are you, uh...sick or something?
5812	Sean	My my heartbeat, it's like, uh, it's irregular. What's the medical word for it?
5813	Carla	"Irregular."
5814	Sean	Yeah! That's it, it's irregular.
5815	Elliot	Ah! Of course! The heart...the old ticker!
5816	Sean	Wow...you're my doctor. I have something for you in my pants.
5817	Sean	No. No, no, no, no, no. Not not I'm not wearing any pants...right now. My pants are over there, and there's a note...from my my G.P. in, um, in the pocket.
5818	Sean	If you guys need me, I'll be under here.
5819	Elliot	This might sound weird, but I'm in love with that guy. And if I don't sleep with him, I'm gonna kill myself! It's inappropriate to jump a patient, isn't it?
5820	Carla	Totally.
5821	Elliot	Have you ever done it?
5822	Carla	Tons of times.
5823	Turk	Tons of times what, Baby?
5824	Carla	Nothing, Baby.
5825	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
5826	Dr. Cox	Why hasn't he had a surgical consult? Oh, you know what, I'm sorry, that's my fault. I didn't make it clear to you how I feel about things that should already be done, so, here it is: I almost always wish things were done already.
5827	J.D.	Look, Mr. Hoffner asked for all his treatment options, and I gave them to him; he never specifically asked for a surgical consult.
5828	Mr. Hoffner	Could I have a surgical consult?
5829	Dr. Cox	You may have whatever you want, there, cowboy.
5830	J.D.	How is that helpful? Do you not get the whole doctor-patient relationship thing? We're supposed to be a team.
5831	Mr. Hoffner	You and me? We're gonna get killed.

5833	Dr. Cox	Oh, for the love of Our Lady of Guadalupe, that is a fine brew.
5834	Nurse	Oh, it's just coffee.
5835	Dr. Cox	Oh, no, no. This is liquid crack; this is a mug full of sunshine; my dear, for me, this is like sex.
5836	Nurse	Oh! Is that why you always finish so quickly?
5837	Dr. Cox	Mmm. And sassy, too. If you could cook a steak, I'd eat it right off your bottom!
5838	Dr. Cox	Oh, ladies! This is that beverage that I've been trying to describe to you. And, it turns out this is gonna sound weird, but the secret is you grind it from beans...not crap.
5839	Nurse Roberts	I'll grind your beans.
5840	Dr. Cox	Oh, Laverne, honestly, when are we gonna get it over with?
5841	Carla	Look, we are already understaffed, and Dr. Kelso just fired two nurses for no good reason, so you will forgive us if we don't have time for The Dr. Cox Show today. Okay?
5842	Carla	Now, we have to reschedule every single nurse for the week.
5843	Nurse Roberts	Well, I don't understand what we're gonna do about the...
5844	Dr. Cox	We don't need them...do we.
5845	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
5846	J.D.'s Narration	Here's the problem about getting a surgical consult: I think Mr. Hoffner should be treated medically, but any surgeon is gonna want to slice and dice him. You see, surgical and medical interns are kind of like two rival gangs not real gangs, more like those cheesy gangs you see in Broadway musicals.
5847	J.D.'s Narration	Still, I knew there was one surgical intern I could count on.
5848	J.D.	"If you have some molds, I will inspect them"
5849	Turk	"I'll remove tumors from your brain to your rectum"
5850	Together	"Between the two of us, there is no wall / We're a surgeon and a doc above it all / A surgeon and a doc, above...it...all!"
5851	Turk	No problem, man. Whatever you want me to tell your patient, I'm your guy.

5853	Elliot	How are you feeling?
5854	Sean	Uhh, well, I'm not tired, if that's what you're getting at.
5855	Elliot	Don't get all male on me! Stress tests are supposed to be hard. Um, it helps if you visualize yourself running towards something, like your girlfriend....
5856	Sean	Mm, I don't have a girlfriend.
5857	Elliot	How could you possibly be single?
5858	Sean	I don't know, I mean, I'm kind of anal-neurotic.
5859	Elliot	Oh, my God! Me too!
5860	Sean	Really?
5861	Elliot	Please! I like to keep my pens in order from least to most ink.
5862	Sean	Oh, that is hot. I don't know, I guess the truth is that I, uh, I don't go out a lot, you know? I always seem to put my foot in my mouth.
5863	Elliot	Oh, I'd let you put your foot in my mouth.
5864	Sean	What?
5865	Elliot	Oh, um, I said I'd let you put your foot in my mouth!
5866	Sean	Oh. That's weird.
5867	Elliot	I know!

5869	Dr. Kelso	Who gets to tell us the symptoms of Menier's Disease? Dr. Murphy!
5870	Doug	Can you use it in a sentence?
5871	Dr. Cox	Ahhh, sorry to interrupt you, there, Bobbo, but I gotta ask you a quick question. Now, when you were born nay, "spawned" by the Dark Prince himself, did that rat-bastard forget to give you a hug before he sent you along your way? Because you can't just let two good nurses go on account of feeling small and insignificant. And, besides, with your money, you oughtta able to keep a little man tucked away in the closet and bring him out whenever you want to knock him around, huh?
5872	Dr. Cox	As you were.
5873	J.D.	Doug. Look away!
5874	Doug	I...can't!

5876	Mr. Hoffner	What are you serving for dinner tonight?
5877	J.D.	You know, that's not really my area.
5878	Mr. Hoffner	I'd like chicken.
5879	J.D.	Okay, Mr. Hoffner, here's your surgical consult. But, I have to warn you, he's gonna agree with the medical course I set out for you. Now then, Dr. Turk, why don't you tell Mr. Hoffner whether or not you think he should have surgery.
5880	Turk	I think he should have the surgery.
5881	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, the important thing to remember is that we're both professionals, and we should behave as such in front of the patient.
5882	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
5883	Dr. Cox	No! Tell me he did not fire her!
5884	Carla	You had to do it! You had to show up Kelso, and now another nurse is out of a job.
5885	Dr. Cox	Excuse me, I went down there to confront
5886	Carla	I am not done! Am I done?
5887	Nurse Roberts	You don't look done.
5888	Carla	You know what your problem is?
5889	Dr. Cox	There are times I put myself in situ
5890	Carla	Oh, my God! Who answers that question!? You see, _that_ is your problem you think you have the answers to e-heh-everything, but instead, you end up throwing gas on the fire, and everyone else has to pay the consequences.
5891	Dr. Cox	That's almost exactly what I was going to say.
5892	Elliot	Carla, um, I'm sorry, can I talk to you for a second?
5893	Dr. Cox	Oh, my God Barbie needs you!
5894	Carla	To be continued.
5895	Dr. Cox	Whoo.
5896	Elliot	Why hasn't he asked me out? I mean, he knows I'm single, I've mentioned, like, five movies that I want to see, I I even keep dropping things so that when I pick them up he can see how flexible I am!
5897	Carla	Look, Elliot, you have to understand, these things take time and self-respect...so we're gonna focus on time.
5898	Elliot	That's a good point. I mean, nobody likes me when they first meet me and
5899	Carla	Exactly!
5900	Carla	I'm helping.
5901	Elliot	'Kay. I mean, we've got all the time in the world, right?
5902	Carla	Right.
5903	Elliot	Oh, no.
5904	Sean	Oh, I knew it. I'm dying. I was exhausted the whole time I was on that treadmill! I should have said something; but I never do, nope. I mean, not when it comes to my well-being. And now...I'm getting a pig heart!
5905	Elliot	No, you're perfect.... You're free to go...today.
5906	Sean	That seems like good news?
5907	Elliot	Best news ever!

5914	Mr. Hoffner	And no girlfriends. It's a...gassy disease.
5915	J.D.	You can't consider this a reoccurrence! He was under-treated last time!
5916	Turk	He's high-risk for colon cancer!
5917	J.D.	That's why we're gonna give him frequent colonoscopies!
5918	Mr. Hoffner	How frequent?
5919	J.D.	I can't believe you're turning this into a competition. Luckily, it's not up to you it's up to Mr. Hoffner.
5920	Mr. Hoffner	I'm gonna go with surgery.
5921	J.D.	You're getting a meat plate for dinner!
5922	Mr. Hoffner	But I eat chicken!

5962	Dr. Kelso	Who?
5963	Dr. Cox	Who? I'll tell you who! ....Coffee Nurse. When you fired Coffee Nurse, you made this whole thing personal!
5964	Dr. Kelso	No, you made it personal. You gave me all that lip yesterday in front of the interns. Look, you wanna know why I laid off those first two nurses? Budgetary constraints forced a cut, and those two had negative reports. And you think I did it to make myself happy...heh-heh.... I wouldn't notice if they all caught on fire.
5965	Dr. Cox	Well, then, why in God's name did you axe Coffee Nurse?

6018	Turk	You're damn right I'm competitive. See, that's what makes me a good doctor I want to win at everything every day, and you should, too.
6019	J.D.	Oh, you know, that sounds like a great friendship.
6020	Turk	Dude, if you don't wanna play Steak again, that's fine, all right? This has nothing to do with friendship, and you know it! So stop blaming me, because the truth is you're angry at yourself 'cause you couldn't get the guy to believe in you!

6055	Sean	I'm okay. Bye.
6056	Carla	You two are perfect for each other.
6057	Elliot	WOO! I got a date. I got a date.
6058	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, sometimes, your ego leads you into battles you can't possibly win.
6059	J.D.'s Narration	And sometimes, you have to admit that feeling competitive isn't a bad thing. Because, if you truly believe you're right, you have to be willing to fight for it.
6060	J.D.	Listen, I know what I'm telling you is the right way to go, and I am not gonna take "no" for an answer. So, what do you say?
6061	Patient	Okay, let's do it.
6062	Janitor	You won. Now beat it.
6063	J.D.	What?
6064	Janitor	Go.
6065	Janitor	Let's get you some sherbet!
6066	J.D.'s Narration	Bottom line, when the stakes are high, you have to go for the win. You know, as long as you don't get caught up in the petty stuff.
6067	Dr. Cox	Newbie, by God, if we lose to these cutters, don't even bother showing up tomorrow!
6068	Dr. Wen	I don't want to beat them, I want to embarrass them!
6069	Together	"A surgeon and a doc, above...it...all!"
6070	Carla	And, GO!
6071	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
6072	Sean	Do you know what I wanna do to you tonight?
6073	Elliot	You...didn't say anything.
6074	Sean	Yeah, I know. It was gonna be really kinky, and I got embarrassed.
6075	Elliot	Really kinky? Was I...a bad girl?
6076	Sean	Very bad. You had to go to the principal's office.
6077	Elliot	Ohhh.
6078	Elliot	Mmm...I have an early shift tomorrow morning I've gotta get some sleep.
6079	Sean	You want me to take you home?
6080	Elliot	No. But, if we're gonna pick up a school girl outfit _and_ have sex, we have to leave this minute.
6081	Sean	Yep. Right.
6082	J.D.'s Narration	One of the best things about women is that they're so unpredictable. Of course, that can really bite you in the ass.
6083	Carla	Boink. Who's your new friend?
6084	J.D.	Look! It's got a letter!
6085	Turk	Okay, fine, so I've put on a few pounds. But how would you like it if somebody did this to you?
6086	Carla	Oh, I wouldn't!
6087	Turk	I just don't think it's fair.
6088	Carla	It isn't fair. Now eat your doughnut.
6089	Turk	"Eat your doughnut."
6090	J.D.'s Narration	And I was having problems with my lady, too.
6091	Nurse Roberts	Can we get a move on, Q-Tip? I got tickets to "Bring in Da Noise, Bring in Da Funk" and I don't want to miss The Noise.
6092	J.D.	Nurse Roberts is gonna take a blood sample so we can check your Hepatitis viral load absolutely no big deal.
6093	J.D.'s Thoughts	No big deal at all!
6094	J.D.	Could somebody get that?
6095	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
6096	Carla	Bambi, these tests are gonna come back negative. Believe me, everybody who works in a hospital eventually gets stuck.
6097	J.D.	Thanks for being so nice to me.
6098	Carla	Who wouldn't be nice to you right now?
6099	Dr. Kelso	Hello! Dr. Dorian, I understand you might need a refresher course in hospital safety. This is a syringe. When filled with infected blood, where is the last place you might want to stick it?
6100	J.D.	In my arm.
6101	Dr. Kelso	Very good, Dr. Dorian!
6102	Lawyer	Ooh, Mr. Sarcastic strikes again!
6103	Lawyer	For God's sake, sir, just fire me!
6104	Dr. Kelso	Just get him to sign the damn paper!
6105	J.D.	What's this?
6106	Lawyer	If you should develop any symptoms that suggest you may have contracted Hepatitis B, this form simply states the hospital is not responsible.
6107	J.D.	Thanks. That's, uh, that's comforting.
6108	Lawyer	Um, I'm I'm sure you'll be fine.
6109	J.D.	Hey, here's your pen.
6110	Lawyer	Uhhh...keep it.

6113	Carla	Isn't that what you were wearing when you left last night?
6114	J.D.'s Narration	Ahhh, the Walk of Shame. All you can really hope for is a supportive friend to help you get through it.
6115	J.D.	Elliot got some booty! Some booty! Some what? What? Elliot got some
6116	Elliot	Stop it!
6117	J.D.	What? It's my "Elliot Got Some Booty" dance.
6118	J.D.	Oh, come on! Elliot, it's not like anybody else knows.
6119	Dr. Cox	What's up, porn star?
6120	Nurse Roberts	Somebody toasted that marshmallow!
6121	Elliot	Well?
6122	J.D.	Somebody got some a action!
6123	Elliot	Ugh!
6124	J.D.	She got some aaaction!
6125	J.D.	Come on...it's funny!
6126	Elliot	I can't find my scrubs top! I must have left it at Sean's.
6127	J.D.'s Narration	The curse of the scrubs machine one of the hospital's most annoying money savers. The only way to get clean scrubs out is to put dirty ones in.
6128	J.D.	How can I help?
6129	Elliot	Give me your shirt.
6130	J.D.	How else can I help?
6131	Elliot	Just go!
6132	J.D.	Okay.
6133	Elliot	Oh! Um.... Good morning, sir!
6134	Dr. Kelso	And yet another proud day for Dr. Reid. I'd say it can only get better, but we both know that isn't true, right sweetheart?
6135	Elliot	....Yeah.

6137	Carla	You know I'm crazy in love with you! Don't tell me you're still obsessing over some stupid joke I made!
6138	Turk	No, I'm not obsessing.
6139	Carla	Good. Beso.
6140	Turk	No, careful. I just might eat you.
6141	Carla	Turk, I see it all the time the long hours, the stress eating, no exercise there's not a doctor here who's in shape.
6142	Dr. Cox	Woo! There's nothing better than a good sweat!
6143	Carla	Mmmm-hmmmm!
6144	Carla	Turk! It was a joke!
6145	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
6146	J.D.	All righty. What do we have here?
6147	Man 1	What you've got here, young man, are four cases of Legionnaires' Pneumonia.
6148	Man 2	So I would start us out on I.V. aminoglycosides.
6149	Man 3	And make sure you check for urinary Legionella antigen.
6150	Man 4	I don't know...it could be viral, considering my gastro-intestinal situation.
6151	Man 3	Here comes the fart joke!
6152	Man 4	No, no, no, really! I think I may have Strep pneumo!
6153	Man 1	All four of us are doctors.
6154	J.D.	Let me guess golf cart accident?
6155	J.D.	Playing.
6156	Man 2	Medical convention.
6157	Man 1	So, junior, what's with the antecubital veinal puncture?
6158	J.D.	Oh, I got hit with the business end of one of my Hep-B patients' syringes last night.
6159	Man 1	I once had a colleague who got bit by a patient with rabies.
6160	J.D.	He's okay, right?
6161	Man 1	No, he died.
6162	Man 3	A friend of mine from med school contracted leprosy. They had to amputate one if his toes just popped it right off!
6163	Man 2	Oh, but Hepatitis! Scary stuff.
6164	J.D.	Well, I'll I'll be okay.
6165	Man 4	Ohhh...maybe!
6166	J.D.	I, uh, I have to go check on a...thing.
6167	Man 1	To interns!

6169	Elliot	I'm sorry, we cannot have intercourse tonight.
6170	Sean	You've gotta stop calling it that.
6171	Elliot	It's just I'm falling so behind in my reading, and I really
6172	Sean	Elliot, don't always assume that I want to be fooling around. Sometimes I'm I'm perfectly happy just being with you and thinking about fooling around.
6173	Elliot	Why can't couples these days just _be_ together? You know?
6174	Sean	Why is it always about sex?
6175	Elliot	Yes! Sean, yes.
6176	Seam	You know, Freud said that ninety percent of all human behavior is motivated by sexual impulses? But, come on. You know, give me some credit. I'd say at least thirty percent of my behavior is motivated by advertising, and the rest by violence in film!
6177	Elliot	For me it's ninety-eight percent getting my dad to love me, two percent chocolate.
6178	Sean	Aha....
6179	Elliot	Now, you have to stop talking to me so I can get some work done.
6180	Elliot	Say it.

6184	Todd	Dude! Way to get your burger on!
6185	Dr. Cox	Now, just exactly what in the hell is this?
6186	Turk	I need to talk to you about something.
6187	Todd	So, Dr. Cox, I haven't had the chance to tell you this yet: Your. Name. Rocks!
6188	Todd	Come on!
6189	Dr. Cox	This conversation stops until cabana boy, here, goes.
6190	Todd	He's not the boss of me!
6191	Turk	Todd.
6192	Todd	Cool!
6193	Turk	So, how do you do it, man? How do you stay in shape?
6194	Dr. Cox	It's called discipline. Some of us work on our appearance.
6195	Turk	Well, you think it's possible that I could work out with you sometime?
6196	Dr. Cox	I don't know about that, stay-puff. I'm not particularly fond of you. Although, it might be fun to see you flail about for a couple of days.
6197	Turk	You know what? Forget about it.
6198	Dr. Cox	Suit yourself, stud. But you see that guy over there?
6199	Dr. Cox	That's you in five years.
6200	Dr. Cox	You in ten years.
6201	Dr. Cox	And guess what, he-man? You in twenty.
6202	Turk	I'm in!

6204	J.D.'s Thoughts	I'm not gonna let those old doctors scare me! John Dorian always gets right back on the horse.
6205	Carla	I'm so sorry you're alone, Mr. Winston, but meningoccocus is highly contagious.
6206	Mr. Winston	I don't have anyone to talk to.
6207	J.D.	Good news, friend. The doctor is in!
6208	Mr. Winston	I asked for a newspaper, and they gave me a bunch of Judy Bloom books from Pediatrics.
6209	J.D.	I don't know anything about those.
6210	J.D.	You have to read "Tales of the Fourth Grade Nothing" completely turned high school around for me!
6211	J.D.'s Thoughts	You see, nobody keeps John Dorian from moving on. Nobody!
6212	Janitor	We've secretly replaced this doctor's blood with Hepatitis blood. Let's see if he notices!
6213	J.D.	You know, I could be really sick here! Could you be nice for once in your life?
6214	Janitor	How's that?
6215	Elliot	I have not been this happy since...well...ever! Don't you think Sean and I are such a great couple?
6216	Dr. Simotes	I don't know who Sean is, and you've never spoken to me before.
6217	Elliot	We just...we just click on every level, you know? God, and the sex! Oh!
6218	Dr. Simotes	Hi, my name is V.J.!
6219	Dr. Kelso	Let's see who's on their game today and start off with a simple case of Pheochromocytoma. What is the initial test of choice, Dr. Reid?
6220	Elliot	24-hour urinary metanephrine?
6221	Dr. Kelso	Right-o! And what is your pre-operative treatment?
6222	Elliot	ACE inhibitors!
6223	Dr. Kelso	Wrong-o! Why don't you attempt to crawl out of your little shame hole, Dr. Reid, and tell me the etiology of hypercalcemia in sarcoidosis.
6224	Dr. Kelso	Gutter ball! Dr. Reid, yesterday you were running around my hospital half naked
6225	Dr. Simotes	Yeah, baby.
6226	Dr. Kelso	today, you're mucking up my rounds! Is your ponytail too tight? Perhaps you have a mild case of the boogie-woogie flu? Something is different; because you, my dear, are slipping. Next patient.
6227	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
6228	Dr. Cox	The key to my exercise program is this one simple truth: "I hate my body."
6229	Turk	What!?
6230	Dr. Cox	Do you understand that the second you look in the mirror and you're happy with what you see, baby, you just lost the battle!
6231	Turk	You should give speeches to teenage girls!
6232	Carla	Baby! I've been looking all over for you!
6233	Dr. Cox	You didn't happen to bring his leash, did you?
6234	Carla	What are you doing down here?
6235	Turk	I'm gonna go for a little run with Dr. Cox.
6236	Carla	But I haven't seen you in forever! We're supposed to go to the park...sorta let you tell me how pretty I am.
6237	Dr. Cox	See ya, chubby.

6253	J.D.	Oh, Carla! Could you do me a favor and just give him a follow-up neuro. exam? I am just so swamped right now that it's

6268	Elliot	Great, so he's thoughtful, too!
6269	Sean	Are you mad at me?
6270	Elliot	No!
6271	Sean	Oh, 'cause the yelling thing makes it seem like you're mad at me.
6272	Elliot	Oh...you would know. I mean, you're so thoughtful, _and_ handsome, and you would never forget your scrubs!

6287	J.D.	..."tom-ah-to".
6288	Dr. Cox	Sure.
6289	J.D.	What?
6290	Dr. Cox	I'll take him. You just gotta grab my three gomers in 408.
6291	J.D.	What's wrong with them?
6292	Dr. Cox	I don't know, Newbie, I'm assuming they're sick.

6304	Elliot	Shut up!
6305	J.D.	What's your problem?
6306	Elliot	This stuff doesn't come as easy to me as it does for you, okay? I study every night, and you know what else I have to do to try and remember all this crap? I tape-record myself saying it, and then I listen to myself over and over. Do you have any idea how annoying it is to hear myself go on and on and on...and on...and on...?
6307	J.D.	No. Oh, come on, I have problems, too!
6308	Elliot	Oh?
6309	J.D.	I traded my meningitis patient just traded him, like a baseball card. And you wanna know why? Because I was afraid of him!
6310	J.D.	I'm a doctor who's afraid of sick people! You wanna take a picture with me?

6345	Sean	I'm not sure. But, I am, I'm really, really sorry.
6346	Elliot	I should be the one apologizing. I just, I got so buried in work and then I just took it all out on you, you know?
6347	Sean	Well, I'm big on forgiving people who look like they're about to kiss me.
6348	Elliot	Ugh, the work never ends, you know? I mean, every day I have to be ready for rounds, I have to take care of patients, I have scut work and research papers due.... Plus I'm starting a new rotation, and if my internship does not got well this year then there's no way I'm getting a good residency next year; and without the residency, there goes my fellowship. And I know that that doesn't leave a lot of time for us. So, on some level, I think that maybe we should make this more casual. But, come on, I mean, I know I could never be casual with you.... We'd just end up here again, right?
6349	Sean	So, what are you saying?
6350	Elliot	I don't know.
6351	Sean	Then why are you saying it?
6352	Elliot	Oh, my God. I th ...I think I'm saying that I can't make this work right now.
6353	Sean	I've got an idea. Let's just you know what, let's just go back to the part where you said that you should be the one apologizing, and then we'll kiss again 'cause that was you know, that was good, and then I'll just, I'll run to my car.
6354	Elliot	Sean, you don't understand how hard it was for me just to get to this point. I mean, if I don't do the very best that I can, I'm gonna hate myself forever.
6355	Sean	What is this obsession with being the best, huh? I mean, what is what is so bad about being adequate? That's what I do.
6356	Elliot	No.... You don't....
6357	Sean	I know.
6358	Elliot	I have to go back in. Um....
6359	Sean	All right, I'll I'm I'm just gonna stand here and...wait with these flowers, 'cause I think in about two minutes you're gonna realize what a big mistake you're making.

6362	J.D.	I want my meningitis patient back.
6363	Dr. Cox	No. Hey, do you know any women who hate themselves enough to actually date me?
6364	J.D.	Why did you let me switch patients with you?
6365	Dr. Cox	Because you asked me to. Oh, and because of your puppy-dog eyes.
6366	J.D.	No, see, you're full of it you knew I was scared, why didn't you just tell me to go in there and deal with it?
6367	Dr. Cox	Well, gosh, Newbie, I don't know what it was about that day. Maybe I hadn't had enough sleep. Maybe my mind was on other things. Maybe I didn't have enough fiber in my diet, and I failed to do my morning business. I don't know what the hell it was, but the bottom line is I didn't feel like spelling it out for you. And I know, I know, you want your little speech, and that's fine because here it is: You're a doctor. You might get sick. Get over it.
6368	J.D.	Thank you. Now, can I have my patient back?
6369	Dr. Cox	No. Because, aside from his weird Judy Bloom obsession, I like him. You will be de-lousing Mr. Schaffer guy's like fly-paper!
6370	J.D.	Fantastic.
6371	Dr. Cox	Oh, and, Belinda? D'you know what else is real contagious?

6373	J.D.'s Narration	You know, when you start med school they warn you that you're gonna have to make sacrifices.... But I guess that means different things to different people.
6374	Hospital Entrance	Elliot exits on her way home. Scattered along the wheelchair ramp are the sad remnants of Sean's bouquet.
6375	J.D.'s Narration	Like giving up something you really want now for something you've wanted your whole life.

6379	J.D.'s Narration	At some point, you might even have to give up your own sense of safety and well-being.
6380	J.D.'s Narration	But after a while, it doesn't feel like you're giving up anything at all.
6381	Mr. Winston	Hey, Doc.

6384	Turk	You ever notice how a tumor looks just like cheese?
6385	Carla	Is that good cocktail conversation?
6386	J.D.	I had this patient today, thought he had blood in his stool? Turned out to be pimento!
6387	Carla	Mmgh.
6388	J.D.	What?
6389	Elliot	I worked on a homeless guy who vomited up an entire mitten. I mean, that's not gonna stop me from wearing mine when it's cold out!
6390	Carla	What is wrong with you people? We have a good bottle of wine, we all look nice for once can we please talk about something other than work? Please?
6391	Turk	Name an actress. J.D. could tell you which movie she appeared in naked.
6392	Carla	I'm gonna go put on my pajamas. I can't believe I shaved my legs for this.
6393	Elliot	Drew Barrymore, Meg Ryan, _and_ Jennifer Connolly?
6394	J.D.	'Boys on the Side'; 'The Doors'; and as for Miss Connolly: topless in 'Inventing the Abbotts', bottomless in 'Requiem for a Dream', and in 'The Hot Spot', you gotta love her frontal and...tush-tush!
6395	Carla	Oh, my God!
6396	Turk	You da man.
6397	J.D.'s Narration	That's the thing about best friends they just get each other.
6398	Ben	You usually get uncomfortable hugging a guy right about now.
6399	Dr. Cox	Bring it, baby.
6400	Ben	This isn't gonna end well for you I used to wrestle in college!
6401	Dr. Cox	Oh, for You broke the hug!
6402	Dr. Cox	So, you're working on a house, or what?
6403	Ben	Yeah, I scored this big restoration job.
6404	Ben	So, who's the, uh, fan club?
6405	J.D.	Neat hug!
6406	Dr. Cox	Newbie, no one likes a lookie-loo. Not now, not ever.
6407	J.D.	So, what's that, like your lucky board...or something?
6408	Ben	Oh, that? No, it's a nail-gun accident.
6409	J.D.	Oh, my God, that's disgusting!
6410	Dr. Cox	I already dosed him with morphine, and the x-ray says the nail went straight through, so it's not that big a d

6434	J.D.	I can't get over it. I mean, who faints anymore? No one's fainted since the 'forties.
6435	Carla	Well, it's okay you're just a doctor, you shouldn't have to _look_ at stuff like that.
6436	J.D.	I was _surprised_. I don't like surprises.
6437	J.D.	Oh, my goodness!
6438	Ben	Pictures capture moments in time.
6439	J.D.	Ooh!
6440	Ben	When they're posed, they're not real. You know, I hate that whole, like, "gneen!" thing. That's why, at a party, you'll see me in the bushes with my camera.
6441	J.D.	You're a little weird, aren't you.
6442	Ben	Just a little bit.
6443	Dr. Cox	Hey, Ben, look what the cat tried to drag in right before it was skinned and eaten.
6444	Ben	"Eeh!"
6445	Jordan	You're still with the annoying camera?
6446	Ben	Do you just skip the whole part where people say hello to each other?
6447	Jordan	Hello, Benji. You look very pale.
6448	Ben	I miss the sweet talk!
6449	Jordan	Maybe it's been too long. Maybe my feelings were hurt a little bit.
6450	Dr. Cox	"Feelings." That's a good one.
6451	Ben	Jordan, you're a big girl now. When you got the divorce, you put people in the awkward position of having to choose between you and Perry.
6452	Jordan	Y-you're my brother!
6453	Ben	Well, admittedly, that made it harder. Oooooh, good one! "Me so cranky! Grrrrrr!"

6455	Surgeon	Patient's name is Moe Weinberg. Cancer is confined to the right testicle. Dr. Turk will be assisting with the removal.
6456	Turk	Sorry, Moe looks like you're about to either lose Larry or Curly!
6457	Turk	Starting the incision.
6458	Surgeon	Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop, stop.
6459	Surgeon	I'm guessing Mr. Weinberg is Jewish?
6460	Turk	Yeah. So?
6461	Surgeon	Why isn't he circumcised?

6463	J.D.'s Narration	A recent medical study found that a mistake is made on about twenty percent of all patients. Most of these are clerical and harmless, but, it still adds up to a lot of near misses.

6472	Jill	Oh! Which one!?
6473	Elliot	Ohh.... Ooh!
6474	Elliot	So, what's new?
6475	Jill	The last time I saw you, I was really stressed out you know, the weight of the world on my shoulders.... So guess what I did.
6476	Elliot	Quit your job!
6477	Jill	Flushed my fish down the toilet! No more feedings, no more cleaning the bowl.... No more being judged for having a second glass of wine
6478	Elliot	Oh, don't even get me started on judgmental fish!
6479	Jill	Uh-huh. But then _that_ sent me on this whole shame spiral, so I decided to travel. I got hit on in Venice! I climbed Mount Kilimanjaro! ...For about ten minutes it's very, very steep.... And _then_ I went to Florida to swim with the Dolphins!
6480	Elliot	Ohhhhh....
6481	Jill	And I don't mean the fish! There was an NFL thing going on at the hotel!
6482	Elliot	Oh, you!
6483	Jill	Oh, I almost forgot! I'm engaged!
6484	Jill	Oh, right.... There used to be a ring there, but then my, uh, fiancé did some soul-searching, and we decided that it needed to be a...little more fancy.
6485	Elliot	Oh, you have no idea how happy this makes me! I've been trying to figure out how to tell you the only reason you're vomiting and exhausted is...well...you're pregnant!
6486	Jill	I'm what, now?
6487	Elliot	Yeah, pregnant! Your fiancé is gonna be so happy!
6488	Jill	My fiancé and I decided not to have sex until we were married.

6494	J.D.	You know, we don't it says it right there on the box.
6495	Ben	Yeah, see; look right there. Hey, don't be mean to him. You're mad at me.
6496	Jordan	Yeah, because you shouldn't be doing contracting work. You. Are. Clumsy! That's why things like this keep happening.
6497	Ben	They don't keep happening.
6498	Jordan	How many times have you hurt yourself with that nail-gun?
6499	Ben	Once.
6500	Jordan	Oh, come on.
6501	Ben	What? With that nail-gun? It's a new nail-gun. If it'd been any other nail-gun, then, yeah, the estimate would be slightly higher.
6502	Jordan	It's not funny!
6503	Ben	You're pretty when you're mad.
6504	Jordan	Ugh, you're so...
6505	J.D.'s Narration	I guess sibling rivalry never goes away. No matter how old you get.

6512	Jordan	Okay, fine. Forget it. Forget it.
6513	Jordan	You big jerk!
6514	Dr. Cox	Y'happen to remember when she used to be fun?
6515	Ben	No.
6516	Dr. Cox	Me neither.
6517	J.D.	Me neither!
6518	Dr. Cox	When spoken to, Newbie. When spoken to. Here, I thought we were clear on that one!
6519	J.D.	Yeah, we were....
6520	Dr. Cox	Hey, Ben, you realize we haven't grabbed a beer in a couple of weeks what's that about?
6521	J.D.'s Thoughts	You know, he's never asked me to grab a beer. But I don't care....
6522	Dr. Cox	Newbie? Would you like to come?
6523	J.D.	Oh, God, yes.
6524	J.D.	To buddies!
6525	Dr. Cox	What in the hell do you think you're doing!? You can't drink beer, you're our driver! That's why we brought you to begin with.

6533	Turk	Like it matters.
6534	Todd	Oh, it matters!
6535	Dr. Kelso	Bye, Todd.
6536	Todd	Okay!
6537	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Turk, I heard about your mishap earlier today, but here's the skinny: If that patient finds out what happened because you can't reign in your yapper, then heads are going to roll. And I promise you yours and Ted's will be the first to go!
6538	Lawyer	What did I do?
6539	Turk	Consider my lips sewn shut, sir. Which, in this hospital, could actually happen!
6540	Dr. Kelso	Young man! At Sacred Heart, we _do_ _not_ make mistakes!
6541	Elliot	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
6542	Jill	Tim, sweetie, I wouldn't have slept with someone else if I didn't love you so much!
6543	Elliot	no! No! No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Stop! Take the phone...!
6544	Jill	Hold on one second. Ho ho hold on!
6545	Jill	Hi!
6546	Elliot	Hi! Your last name is Tracy! Well, of course, you know your last name is Tracy, but what you don't know is there's a woman down in 308 whose _first_ name is Tracy. So I started thinking about your urine sample, and how you always carry that water bottle with you and stay very well-hydrated which is why your pee is a much lighter color than most people's pee. And then I remembered the sample that came back with your name on it was bright yellow and the other Tracy she is not much of a water drinker...which is why I think her skin looks so pasty
6547	Jill	Okay, sweetie, I'ma need you to get to the point.
6548	Elliot	You're not pregnant! The lab tech just switched the samples!

6555	Dr. Cox	Oh, chalk boy....
6556	J.D.	"Chalk boy"....
6557	Dr. Cox	Gladys? If you could chalk it without pleasuring it, that'd be terrific.
6558	Dr. Cox	What?
6559	Ben	I know you're going for that gruff doctor routine
6560	Dr. Cox	Uh-huh.
6561	Ben	but it just comes off sounding like a cartoon pirate. "Arrr, Gladys! Chalk it! Don't pleasure it! Arrr!"

6567	Dr. Cox	All right, Clara, you can go ahead and order yourself a Cosmopolitan; we'll just grab a cab home.
6568	J.D.	Actually, Ben has been sneaking me beers all night, and I'm quite drunk.
6569	Dr. Cox	Well, that's just great.
6570	Dr. Cox	Hey, Ben, what...why is this hand still bleeding?
6571	Ben	I dunno. Sorta weird, 'cause I cut myself shaving last week and it wouldn't stop bleeding.
6572	J.D.'s Narration	One of the things that sucks about being a doctor is that you never miss a red flag.
6573	Dr. Cox	Could I have you over here for two seconds, just

6575	Dr. Cox	Just humor me. It's probably mono, anyway.

6585	Turk	Well, damn! That don't sit well with the Big Dog!
6586	J.D.	I'm with you, Big Dog.
6587	J.D.'s Narration	I was paged because Ben's blood-work was finally ready. Unfortunately, the chart wasn't in the out-box. I'd knock, but the hematopathologist is the meanest, intern-hatingest monster in this hospital.

6591	J.D.'s Narration	The truth is, the hematopathologist was the last person in this hospital I wanted to deal with.

6593	Janitor	I don't jump out and scare you! I follow you around all day! I only got about an hour-and-a-half worth of work around here, and the rest of the time I track you...like an animal.

6608	Dr. Cox	Look, Ben, I know I am prone to making the occasional casual reference to your sister being a, well, a wire-haired man-goblin
6609	Dr. Cox	but I hope that has no effect on your relationship with her.
6610	Ben	That's really very sweet of you to think that you're that important.

6635	Turk	Thank you....
6636	Turk	Look here: My friend needs you to check on the Ben Sullivan file, and you're gonna do it right now. Why? Because you're not gonna drop the ball like you did on my patient.

6693	J.D.	Oh, sorry.

6696	Carla	You know there's only one more person to talk to.
6697	J.D.'s Thoughts	The Hematopathologist.
6698	J.D.	Hello?
6699	Hematopathologist	Call me Dr. Bob.
6700	J.D.	You go by your first name?
6701	Hematopathologist	No, first name's Fred.
6702	J.D.	"Fred Bob"?
6703	Hematopathologist	What can I do you for?
6704	J.D.	Hi, I w I was hoping that you could recheck Ben Sullivan's blood smear.
6705	Hematopathologist	Well, that depends, young man. Do you actually think I made a mistake, or do you just wish I did?
6706	J.D.	I kinda wish you did.
6707	Hematopathologist	Then I'll do it.
6708	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
6709	Ben	Whoa! Sorry, there, giant, 'seventies security guard...guy.
6710	Ben	Cold out here, huh?
6711	J.D.	Yes!
6712	Ben	Argh! You could hang a freakin' raincoat off my nipples.... Left one at least, only the right one's just a little shy.
6713	J.D.	Sticking with the "weird" thing, huh?
6714	Ben	It works for me.
6715	Ben	Listen, um, you guys wouldn't be keeping me here if there wasn't something potentially wrong with me, would you?
6716	J.D.	No, we wouldn't.
6717	Ben	Hey! I wanted to ask you, um, how come this guy's always, like, following you in the pictures?
6718	J.D.	Oh, my God....
6719	Ben	Him.
6720	Ben	You want to see the rest of the pictures I took today?
6721	J.D.	Yeah.
6722	Ben	Look at that one.
6723	J.D.	These are good, man!
6724	J.D.	Ben, good news, man!
6725	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
6726	Ben	Hey, J.D., let's get a picture together.
6727	J.D.	Okay.
6728	Ben	Come on.
6729	J.D.'s Thoughts	It was weird how everyone had come to see Ben off.
6730	Ben	Everybody in?
6731	J.D.'s Narration	After all, he had only been here one day, and there wasn't even anything wrong with him.
6732	J.D.	Wait, why would you want a picture like that? I thought you said that posed pictures aren't real?
6733	Ben	Come on, J.D. None of this is real. You know that.
6734	J.D.	What do you mean?
6735	Ben	Think about it.
6736	Dr. Kelso	Stop looking for trouble just because you like this patient, and face the facts!
6737	Carla	Either your instincts are right, or your brain is trying to protect you from the truth.
6738	Hematopathologist	Do you actually think I made a mistake, or do you just wish I did?
6739	J.D.	I kinda wish you did.
6740	Dr. Cox	Janice!
6741	Ben	Over here, big guy.
6742	Dr. Cox	Let's try this again: Are those the test results?
6743	J.D.	Uh, yeah.
6744	J.D.	Ben, you have leukemia.
6745	Ben	Well, that sucks.
6746	J.D.	...Yeah....
6747	The song reprises	"Everybody's gotta hold on hope. It's the last thing that's holdin' me."
6748	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
6749	Janitor	You people, you think of me as nothing but The Janitor!!
6750	J.D.	That's not true.
6751	Janitor	What's my name?
6752	J.D.	Uh, I know the nurses call you Sir Plunge-A-Lot.
6753	Janitor	I know.
6754	J.D.	Ah, come on, I'm sure you don't know my name, so
6755	Janitor	John Michael Dorian.
6756	J.D.	How'd you know my middle name?
6757	Janitor	Because I care!
6758	J.D. Narration	Today seems like a good day to hide out in one of my patient's rooms.
6759	Jordan	You, my friend, are an incompetent fool.
6760	J.D. Narration	Unless, of course, my patient is missing.
6761	Jordan	Where's my brother?
6762	J.D.	I don't
6763	Jordan	Oh, oh, if you say "I don't know," I'll show you what I learned last week in my crotch-punching class!
6764	J.D.	I... think it's great that you're going back to school!
6765	Jordan	Why would he wander off? Oh! Maybe he went to a real hospital!
6766	J.D.	Jordan, he found out he had leukemia yesterday. It's life-changing news. You can't be surprised if he's a little depressed.
6767	Ben	Hey, Doc, this guy's got something on his shoulder you might want to take a look at!
6768	J.D.	Ben, put the small children down.
6769	Ben	Anybody missing one of these?
6770	J.D.	No, Ben. Ben! Okay, okay...
6771	Ben	You heard the good doctor. Come on, you'll have to sit this one out. You know, my hands are free which leaves me to do... this!
6772	J.D.	No, Ben! Ben, seriously! Ben! Not funny! Ben, stop! Ben, put me down. Ben! Fasterrrr! Whooooooo! Ha ha ha ha ha! Eeeee-eagle! Whooo hoooo!
6773	Ben	Had enough?
6774	Jordan	How sad.
6775	Ben	You want a turn? C'mon!
6776	Jordan	Don't you dare! Don't you dare!
6777	Ben	C'mon!
6778	Jordan	Noooo!
6779	Jordan	Ben, put me down! No!
6780	Ben	Timmy, quick! Get a shot of the mean lady!
6781	Jordan	Hey! Hey, Shorty! Listen, you short person! You take that picture, you'll be glad you're in a hospital! Hellllp!
6782	Ben	I think you got yourself a Christmas card right there.
6783	Jordan	Yeah, you're funny. Look, I don't understand why you refuse to put on a hospital gown.
6784	Ben	Because I don't like people to see my bum.
6785	Jordan	So wear underwear.
6786	Ben	You know how I feel about underwear.
6787	Jordan	Every girl who came to our house in the mid-eighties knows how you feel about underwear.
6788	Ben	Ha ha, the sweatpants years.
6789	J.D.	I don't like that much freedom down there. Makes me tingle in my giblets.
6790	Jordan	I swear, if you don't start taking this seriously...
6791	J.D. Narration	I'm a good intern, but when you're dealing with disease and family, an intern just doesn't cut it. What you need...
6792	J.D. Narration	...Is a hero.
6793	Dr. Cox	Shut up. Shut up. And definitely shut up.
6794	J.D.	But I didn't even say anything.
6795	Dr. Cox	I know, but I enjoy saying it to you. Okay, here's the deal. If we're gonna beat this thing, and we damn sure are, we're gonna do it one way and one way only. We're gonna be a team! We're gonna be a team, team, team, team, team! You hear me?
6796	J.D.	I hear you, Dr. Cox!
6797	Dr. Cox	I am so not speaking to you, Rhonda, thank you!
6798	J.D.	I'm sorry. I got very excited. Go! Heh.
6799	Dr. Cox	What do you say, children? Are we a team?
6800	Jordan	I'm in.
6801	Ben	Go, Team Cancer!
6802	J.D.'s Thoughts	Wow. He did it!
6803	Dr. Cox	I've got to go take care of some other patients.
6804	Turk	I don't believe this! I didn't get tomorrow's whipple procedure!
6805	Carla	I know, I know.
6806	Turk	This is ridiculous!
6807	Carla	Baby, calm down.
6808	Turk	What's a brother gotta do to get a whipple around here, huh? What's a brother gotta do? Tell me! What do I gotta do to get a whipple around here?
6809	Carla	Listen to me! You gotta stop turning your medical training into some ego-driven contest. No one else is doing that.
6810	Bonnie	Oh, I got the whipple. Suck it, Turk.
6811	Carla	I will end her!
6812	Turk	No, no.
6813	Todd	Dude, dude, let her go. It'll be so hot!
6814	Dr. Kelso	Can you tell me the treatment regiment for organophosphate toxicity, Dr. Reid?
6815	Elliot	Well, first I would give intramuscular epinephrine, then IV calcium gluconate followed by emergency hemodialysis.
6816	Dr. Kelso	Sweetheart, if I wanted you to give me three wrong answers in a row, I'd just ask for the usual. Dr. Murphy, care to jump in?
6817	Doug	Um, I think it's
6818	Dr. Kelso	Do you have a speech impedement, sport?
6819	Doug	Excuse me?
6820	Dr. Kelso	You insist on starting every answer with "Um..." so I figure you've either got a speech impedement or you're a stammering know-nothing who doesn't belong in medicine!
6821	Doug	Um
6822	Dr. Kelso	Well spoken. Now, get out. All of you. Get out! Get out! Out, out, out!
6823	Dr. Kelso	Jumpin' Jupiter, I do enjoy the tough love.
6824	Dr. Cox	They probably like it, there, too, Bob, whether they admit it or not.
6825	Dr. Kelso	Well...
6826	Dr. Cox	"Oh, the old guy's so tough on me, but I love him!" Riiiight, riiiight? They hate you, Bob. They hate you from the bottom of your hooves to the top of your pitchfork. They hate you, dear God, they hate you good.
6827	Dr. Kelso	What are you laughing at?
6828	Nurse Roberts	That hooves and pitchfork part. Why?
6829	Dr. Kelso	No reason.
6830	Dr. Cox	Now, do you think you can make Ben behave like a patient or not?
6831	J.D.	No problem!
6832	J.D.	Uh... got him to put his gown on.
6833	Ben	He sure did! And now my butt itches on account of this scratchy chair. What are we watching?
6834	Dr. Cox	"Wings." And shut up, I like the cab driver. He... slays me.
6835	J.D.	Antonio played by the actor Tony Shalhoub. Also particularly fantastic in a film called "Big Night.""
6836	Dr. Cox	Congratulations! Your Dimaggio-like streak for saying nothing even remotely interesting is still alive and well!
6837	J.D. Narration	I didn't care about the abuse. The most amazing thing for me was to watch how Dr. Cox dealt with his friend. How he made him feel safe.
6838	Ben	Do I have to get a special doctor?
6839	Dr. Cox	An oncologist. Do we have to talk about this? There must be something else on your mind.
6840	Ben	Nope. Just pretty much that leukemia thing.
6841	Dr. Cox	Ben, leukemia is a petty, ugly illness and we'll not dignify it by speaking of it unless absolutely necessary. Is that clear to you?
6842	Ben	Gotcha.
6843	J.D.	You are such a stud!
6844	Ben	That was interesting.
6845	Turk	So, uh, Dr. Wen, you asked Bonnie to assist you with this whipple procedure?
6846	Dr. Wen	Yes, I did.
6847	Bonnie	Thanks again, sir!
6848	Carla	I guess we should just let it go. I mean, neither one of us wants to do anything to make it worse, right?
6849	Turk	You guys ever notice how you're both Asian?
6850	Janitor	Your mother's maiden name is Turner.
6851	J.D.	So you used your key to get into my personnel file. Big deal.
6852	Janitor	Your first kiss was with Sarah Briggs at the embarrassing age of sixteen. She wore a green turtleneck, and you wonder sometimes if she still thinks about you. I'm guessing no.
6853	J.D.	How could you possibly know that?
6854	Janitor	I'm your father.
6855	Ted	Morning, Dr. Dorian.
6856	J.D.	Ted, you probably don't notice it yourself, but this hospital is a freak show!
6857	Ted	This is my band. We're all working from different departments in the hospital. Leg-al...
6858	Singer 1	Acc-ounting...
6859	Singer 2	Shipping and receiving...
6860	Singer 3	Online property management including pest control, nighttime security and non-arboreal garden serv-ices...
6861	All	Hmmmm-mmm!
6862	J.D.	That's that's just great.
6863	Ted	We mostly do acappella versions of cartoon theme songs.
6864	All	Here he comes! / Here comes Speedracer! / He's a demon on wheels!
6865	Ted	Turn, turn, turn, turn.
6866	All	He's a demon and he's gonna be a chasin' after someone!
6867	Ted	That's good, let's do it again.
6868	Muffled singing	Here he comes! / Here comes Speedracer! He's a demon on wheels...
6869	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Reid! I hope I wasn't too hard on you on rounds this morning.
6870	Elliot	Oh, it's okay, sir. I don't hate myself much more than I usually do!
6871	Dr. Kelso	Well, turnabout's fair play and all that, so here's an evaluation form. I figured I'd try to get get a read on how all you interns think I'm doing. Don't sign your name, it's completely anonymous. And Dr. Reid? I'm no she-doc, I can take it!
6872	Carla	Ah ha ha ha! Whoo! You're gonna crush him, right?
6873	Elliot	Oh, yes. How do you spell inadequate?
6874	Carla	Give me that. I'll fill it out for you.
6875	Dr. Zeltzer	So, Mr. Sullivan, your blast percentage is quite a bit higher than we all expected. Around eighty percent.
6876	Ben	That's bad, right? You want the number to be low, huh? Like in, uh, golf?
6877	Dr. Zeltzer	Yes, exactly. Like in golf. Do you do you play?
6878	Jordan	Oh, who the hell cares if he plays golf?!
6879	Dr. Zeltzer	Uh, I was bonding.
6880	Ben	Hey, doing a good job, too.
6881	Dr. Zeltzer	Thanks.
6882	Jordan	Who is this clown?
6883	Dr. Cox	Paul here is the best oncologist in the room so why don't we all clam up and listen?
6884	Dr. Zeltzer	Uh, we need to start chemo.
6885	Ben	When?
6886	Dr. Zeltzer	This afternoon.
6887	Ben	I'm afraid this afternoon isn't going to work for me. Ironically, I have a golf game to get to.
6888	Dr. Cox	Hey, Benji, don't sweat it. Come on, give me a break.
6889	Ben	Hey, you gonna be there?
6890	Dr. Cox	Um, I got about a thousand patients to look after so, no, I'm probably going to miss this first one. But I will leave my lovely and talented assistant Kimmy.
6891	Ben	Yeah, sure. You know. Okay.
6892	Dr. Zeltzer	Oh, uh, am I Kimmy?
6893	J.D.	No, I'm Kimmy!
6894	Dr. Zeltzer	Oh. Good.
6895	Elliot	I'm telling you, Carla torched Dr. Kelso for me.
6896	Carla	No matter what I wrote down, I always brought it back to sexual inadequacy.
6897	Elliot	So good!
6898	Doug	Hello, ladies.
6899	Elliot	Hey, Doug!
6900	Carla	Hey, Doug.
6901	Elliot	What'd you write on Kelso's evaluation?
6902	Doug	What evaluation?
6903	Elliot	You didn't get yours yet?
6904	Doug	Nobody got one.
6905	J.D. Narration	Around here, bad news always comes back to haunt you.
6906	Turk	Dr. Wen, I just want to take this opportunity to once again apologize to you, and the entire Asian community.
6907	Dr. Wen	I'll pass it on at the next big meeting. You know, Christopher, surgeons don't have to be shallow, rank-obsessed cliches.
6908	Turk	So, who's the best surgery intern? Is it Bonnie? Is it me? I just I gotta know.
6909	Todd	The periampullary carcinoma patient had a failed palliatitive stenting of the common bile duct so this is what I want to do. I want to go ahead and prep him for a pyloris sparing pancreaticoduodenectomy. Thanks.
6910	Todd	What's up, T-Man?! Show The Todd some love!
6911	J.D.	Dr. Cox, Ben seemed pretty down after you left so I thought I could cover for you and you could go hang out with him.
6912	Dr. Cox	Well, you're just an absolute lamb but you don't have to do that.
6913	J.D.	Oh, I don't mind, I just
6914	Dr. Cox	Newbie, stop!
6915	J.D. Narration	It's funny how people handle bad news in different ways.
6916	J.D. Narration	Some people have a visceral reaction...
6917	Todd	Time to get my soapy soap on!
6918	J.D. Narration	Some people go into denial...
6919	Turk	No way.
6920	J.D. Narration	And others...
6921	Dr. Cox	What chance do you give a guy with Ben's blast percentage, huh? Twenty percent, thirty, maybe? You see, I can't handle that. I cannot. So, no thank you there, Johnny.
6922	J.D. Narration	...Others just walk away.
6923	J.D. Narration	Chemotherapy looks harmless, but it's really poison pumped directly into your veins.
6924	Ben	You know, every time I got sick when I was a kid, Mom would get me a Tonka truck.
6925	Jordan	Yeah, so?
6926	Ben	So where's my Tonka truck?
6927	Ben	Ha ha! Score!
6928	J.D.	The Earth Mover! Can I see?
6929	Ben	No! See with your eyes, man. Not your hands. Seeee?
6930	Jordan	I can't believe Perry bailed on you. Typical. He's always out the door if things get too real.
6931	J.D.	This is the true story...
6932	Ben	Truuuue storrrayyyy!
6933	Jordan	Of four people forced to hang out in a hospital!
6934	Ben	To find out what happens when people stop being polite...
6935	Jordan	Awwww!
6936	Dr. Cox	And start being realllll!
6937	J.D.	He didn't bail.
6938	Ben	If he did, he's a total wuss.
6939	Elliot	Sir, you said you were giving evaluations to all the interns.
6940	Dr. Kelso	Well, not at the same time, sweetheart. With your way there would be no accountability. No back and forth. You wouldn't have to explain to me why... let's see... "I'm most likely frustrated because I haven't gotten any since the bay of pigs."
6941	Elliot	Sir, I'm so sorry. Are we cool?
6942	Dr. Kelso	What could possibly have possessed you to write such filth!
6943	Carla	Uh, Dr. Kelso? I need to tell you something.
6944	Elliot	That's okay, Carla, I'm going to take care of that patient. Dr. Kelso, I did it because I didn't think you'd know it was me and I thought that it would be funny.
6945	Dr. Kelso	Let's take a walk. I'd like to tell you a few things that I think are funny.
6946	Turk	Come on. How could this guy be the best?
6947	Dr. Wen	You want to know the difference between you two? When you're working, I can always see your wheels turning. You're thinking about what you have to do next, what could go wrong. You're not in the moment. As much as it pains me to say it... The Todd is.
6948	Turk's Thoughts	Please! Just because I'm thorough and I want to keep two kelly clamps on the field in case their appendiceal artery is inadvertently incised so I can gain immediate hemostatic control doesn't mean I think too much. Plus, what if I needed to...
6949	Todd's Thoughts	Dum de dum dum dum shiny scalpel... dum de dum dum dum gonna slice him up...
6950	Janitor	You're afraid of escalators.
6951	J.D.	That's not uncommon.
6952	Janitor	You like the way cashmere feels on your skin!
6953	J.D.	How are you doing this?
6954	Janitor	That's right! You run away! Run away from the truth!
6955	J.D.	Look, Dr. Cox, I've been doing a lot of thinking and I honestly think that the only reason you're not down at that hospital right now is that you're afraid.
6956	Dr. Cox	I think you're right. I do. Partly because you've really... gotten to know me this year.
6957	Dr. Cox	But mostly it's because, well... I told you that I was afraid earlier today so please don't tell me that you've come here to reiterate things to me that I've already said because I know the things I've already said. In fact... I'm the one who said them.
6958	J.D.	You gotta get back in the game, Coxie!
6959	J.D.	Okay, Coxie was a mistake. Pretend I didn't say Coxie.
6960	Dr. Cox	Geeeet out.
6961	J.D.	Look, it boggles my mind that you just bail on a patient!
6962	Dr. Cox	No. A patient is a stranger in a bed that you can distance yourself from whenever you need to. Ben is my friend and I'm going to try to get in there to visit him in the next couple of weeks but if I can't... that'll be very sad for me. But really... it will just mean that I'm human. Oh, and newbie? Please don't think that you have come here because Ben needs me. You're here because you're scared to death that you might have to rely on yourself for the first time ever and that... that is just the saddest thing of all.
6963	J.D. Narration	I think one of the most universal human experiences is feeling alone. You'd never know it, but there's most likely tons of people feeling the exact same way.
6964	J.D. Narration	Maybe because you're feeling abandoned.
6965	J.D. Narration	Maybe because you realize that you aren't as self-sufficient as you thought.
6966	J.D. Narration	Maybe because you know you should've handled something differently.
6967	J.D. Narration	Or maybe because you aren't as good as you thought you were. Either way, when you hit that low point, you have a choice. You can either wallow in self-pity...
6968	J.D. Narration	...Or you can suck it up. It's your call.
6969	Music	Bum bum bum bum bum bum...
6970	Turk	You know what, Dr. Wen? I don't care if I'm not the best right now because I'm all about the upside and one day, I'm going to own this place. That's right. All of this right here, all of this right here is gonna be the Chris Turk Wing.
6971	Music	Bum bum bum wah bum bum bum wah...
6972	Carla	Dr. Kelso, I wrote that evaluation. It was me. Elliot didn't write a word.
6973	Elliot	But I would've written every single word if I had the courage! And the other side of the tracks upbringing that Carla did! Because you know what I think of you?
6974	Carla	You tell him!
6975	Music	Bunm bum bum bummmm...
6976	Elliot	You're mean.
6977	J.D. Narration	As for me, I decided that if Dr. Cox couldn't do it, well then I would have to be the one there for Ben.
6978	All	Bum bum bum... when criminals in this world appear and break the laws that they should fear / And frighten all who see or hear / The cry goes up both far and near / For Underdog! / Underdog / Underdog / Underdog / Speed of light, roar of thunder / Fight all who rob or plunder / Underdog! / Ahhhh! Underdog! Underdog!
6979	J.D.	Well, thank God.
6980	Dr. Cox	Good-bye, newbie.
6981	Dr. Cox	So, uh... you know, what's up?
6982	Ben	You know, this and that. Hey, I met someone.
6983	Dr. Cox	Really?
6984	Ben	Yes. Well, she took a stool sample so I think she works here. Uh, redhead? Uh, tall?
6985	Dr. Cox	Not on the staff, no.
6986	Ben	No? Strange young lady.
6987	Dr. Cox	Are we just gonna sit around here and make jokes all day? Is that the drill?
6988	Ben	If it makes you uncomfortable, then you can just bolt again.
6989	Dr. Cox	I think it's only fair that you hear my end of the story here, Ben.
6990	Ben	All right. Fine.
6991	Ben	Oh, man. I love you but you you're a complete wuss.
6992	Dr. Cox	I guess I got a little scared.
6993	Ben	Well, let me know if there's anything I can do to help you through this rough patch.
6994	Dr. Cox	Oh, give me a break. I'm not good at this stuff, you know that.
6995	Ben	It's okay.
6996	Dr. Cox	I don't like the big conversations.
6997	Ben	It's cool. I've been thinking about death a lot lately.
6998	Dr. Cox	Oh, you gotta be kidding me...
6999	Ben	You think it's like New York? You know?
7000	J.D. Narration	To most people, it might have seemed like nothing had changed.
7001	Dr. Kelso	Well, Dr. Murphy?
7002	Doug	Umm...
7003	J.D. Narration	But it had a little.
7004	Dr. Kelso	Go on.
7005	Doug	Could it be lupus?
7006	Dr. Kelso	Good job, sport.
7007	Doug	Phew.
7008	Turk	"Joy... and pain!" Here we go, here we go! "And sunshine..." What else? What else? "And rain!" Cut him up! Cut him up!
7009	J.D. Narration	As for Ben, he actually responded to the chemo and went into remission. Hopefully, he won't be back, but who knows? Still, that's not what this story's about.
7010	J.D. Narration	It's about the day I realized that admitting we're not heroic is when we're the most heroic of all.
7011	All	Now unleash the dog of wonder / Tearing evil, spans asunder! / Underdog / Ahhhh, Underdog! / Underdog...
7012	J.D. Narration	I guess he'll always be a hero to me.
7013	Janitor	"He'll always be a hero to me." What a girl. What else we got?
7014	Janitor	Theater camp. Ha ha. Bingo.

7017	J.D.'s Narration	Since I was a kid, I've been able to sleep through anything - storms, sirens, you name it. Last night I didn't sleep. Couldn't stop thinking about this past year.
7018	J.D.	Agh!
7019	Elliot	Oh, please, I've seen you naked before.
7020	Todd	Dude, you had that? Five, up high, for cherry pie!
7021	Dr. Kelso	You find it funny, Dr. Dorian? Why don't you tell me the EKG findings of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome?
7022	J.D.	I haven't even showered yet.
7023	Jordan	We could shower together for old time's sake.
7024	J.D.	You know, I never woulda slept with you if you'd told me you were Dr. Cox's ex-wife.
7025	Dr. Cox	What was that, Newbie?
7026	J.D.	Uhhh....
7027	Jordan	Relax. He doesn't know.
7028	J.D.	He likes Carla, anyway.
7029	Turk	I got Carla wrapped around my finger.
7030	J.D.	I heard that!
7031	Carla	What are you guys talking about?
7032	J.D.	Nothing.
7033	Turk	Thank you.
7034	J.D.	Forget about it.
7035	Jordan	No, no, no. You can't forget about these.
7036	Nurse Roberts	I'd pull those hands back if you want to keep 'em, Q-Tip.
7037	Lawyer	That's just the kind of thing that can be construed as sexual harassment.
7038	Lawyer	You got a few hairs in the sink, there, huh? For God's sake, man, don't comb so hard.
7039	J.D.	All right, enough is enough!
7040	J.D.	Oh!
7041	Janitor	I guess I don't fit in with your mirror friends. Enjoy.
7042	J.D.'s Narration	I don't know why my mind is all over the place. Maybe it's because today isn't just any other day; it's my last day as an intern.
7043	Elliot	Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh!
7044	Turk	Ohhh, you got me! Lemme go, lemme go, lemme go, lemme go!
7045	J.D.	Ahhh!
7046	Turk	Hey, amigo!
7047	Elliot	Can you guys believe this?
7048	Turk	'Cause tomorrow we are officially residents!
7049	Todd	Let's get our last day on!
7050	J.D.'s Thoughts	What the hell, he deserves it, too.
7051	J.D.	Mo
7052	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
7053	J.D.	So, Mr. Bober, here, has been complaining of abdominal pain and nausea; looks like colicistitis.
7054	Dr. Cox	Oh, come on what the hell, Newbie. This gentleman is suffering from an inflamed gallbladder, and you actually have him eating a grilled-cheese sandwich. Hhhere's an idea: why don't we just have him wash the whole thing down with a big ol' mug of vodka.
7055	Dr. Cox	Mr. Bober, back there, is one of our frequent flyers; he's been with us every six months for the last two years, and I've grown rather fond of him. So if you could somehow manage to not kill him, well then - oh, gee that would just be ducky.
7056	J.D.	I'll see what I can do. Hey, how come you haven't mentioned it's my last day as an intern?
7057	Dr. Cox	Haven't I?
7058	J.D.	Nuh-uh.
7059	Dr. Cox	Come here!
7060	J.D.	Okay.
7061	Dr. Cox	Despite the fact that when you wake up tomorrow morning you will be a resident, you'll still be the same excitable little girl that you are right now; the only difference will be that some sorry new intern will probably mistake you for somebody who actually knows something.
7062	J.D.'s Thoughts	Why is he so uptight today?
7063	Jordan	Hey, Perry.
7064	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, okay.
7065	Dr. Cox	Jordan.... To what do we owe the horror?
7066	Jordan	Ohhh, come on, Perry. No soft spot for the one woman who slept with you sober? Now, if you could just sign this insurance physical, I'll go back to trying to forget that horrible, horrible night.
7067	Dr. Cox	For me to sign this, I would actually have to give you a physical. And when I say "I," I, of course, mean absolutely anybody but me. Barbie!
7068	Dr. Cox	Give my ex-wife, here, a physical. And don't be afraid of that third eye on her chest. Just remember, it's just as scared of you as you are of it.
7069	Elliot	Let's get physical?
7070	Jordan	Auh.
7071	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
7072	Carla	It doesn't matter, because it
7073	Turk	And I don't think
7074	J.D.	Carla.... Can you do me a favor? This Mr. Bober needs to get another Foley catheter - I am so swamped.
7075	Carla	Sure, Bambi, no problem. But, we're not finished yet!
7076	Turk	I know we're not finished yet! See, I didn't say we were finished yet.... But, really, baby, it's up to you.
7077	J.D.'s Narration	When a couple gets in an argument, you should run for it before you get roped in.
7078	Carla	Hey, J.D.
7079	Carla	You got it, baby. You got him, that's right.
7080	Turk	I got him.
7081	Carla	Bring him in.
7082	Turk	I. Got. Him.
7083	Carla	We were talking about our relationship, and how great everything is going. And all I said was, "It's weird to think I'll never date again."
7084	Turk	Ah, that's close, honey, but not quite what you said. See, what you said was, "It's weird to think I'll never _get_ to date again." You see that? "..._Get_ to date again" - like she's missing out. How messed up is that?
7085	Carla	I did not say "get"! You're being ridiculous. What do you think, J.D.?
7086	J.D.'s Thoughts	Careful, tiger. Careful.
7087	J.D.	I wish people would call me "tiger."
7088	Carla	What?
7089	J.D.	I agree with Laverne!
7090	Nurse Roberts	Huh?
7091	Nurse Roberts	Damn kids and their stupid problems. I just want to get home to a warm bath, catch a little bit of that 'Fear Factor.'
7092	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
7093	Dr. Kelso	Ted, the reason we're not admiring the new parking structure is because you failed to get legal clearance from the Zoning Board. Honestly, sometimes I wonder if you're happy here.
7094	Ted	Do it, Ted; just do it.
7095	Dr. Cox	Oh, Bob! When I heard you were up on the roof, I just naturally assumed it was because your evil mission here on planet earth had finally come to an end; so, tell me this: where, exactly, is the mother ship?
7096	Dr. Kelso	Look, Ted, it's Dr. Cox.
7097	Ted	Hey.
7098	Dr. Cox	I just saw the new shift schedule and, dammit, Bob, gimme a break, will ya?
7099	Dr. Kelso	Oh, I'm glad you're here. The hospital needs to find a new residency director, and I've decided to recommend you. Now, finish your tantrum on your own; because I am going to go down to the cafeteria and get myself a fro-yo. Ted, chop-chop!
7100	Ted	Save my spot.
7101	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
7102	Carla	Bambi, Mr. Bober's hypertensive. I think he's becoming septic.
7103	J.D.	This guy is more work than all my other patients, combined.
7104	Carla	Well, maybe if you tell him how hard it is on you, he'll get better!
7105	Carla	I'll get paper towel.
7106	J.D.	Don't worry about it; somebody else'll get it.
7107	Janitor	Yeah. Who can we get? I'm not shocked, that's how you live your life, isn't it? Got a problem? Hey, just pass it on down the line....
7108	J.D.'s Thoughts	I was gonna say something, but, it turns out, he gave me a pretty good idea.
7109	J.D.	Thank you so much for taking Bober from me.
7110	Elliot	But, J.D., I just
7111	J.D.	I owe you.
7112	Jordan	I'm a little doormat, sit and stay. Let people use me every single day.
7113	Elliot	E-e-excuse me?
7114	Jordan	Oh, it's a song I'm working on. I made it up.
7115	Elliot	So, I let myself get taken advantage of, sometimes; you know. I mean, big deal - how do you make friends?
7116	Jordan	Look, I've seen your type before. You're that girl that convinced herself she wanted to lose her virginity at a frat party while another guy was asleep in the room.
7117	Elliot	Chas really cared for me.
7118	Jordan	Ah, I know; and I'm sure you have a cool "Jungle Party" t-shirt to prove it. Now, can we please finish this physical? And, I can't pee right now, so you'll have to go for me.
7119	Jordan	What a good girl. Good girl.
7120	J.D.'s Narration	Still, Elliot wasn't gonna let herself get stuck with Mr. Bober, either.
7121	Turk	How you doin', Mr... Bober?
7122	Mr. Bober	Fine.
7123	Turk	'Kay, why did you let Elliot turf him up here?
7124	Todd	I dunno. All I really remember is she dropped her pen, and bent over.... Dude! Thong City!!
7125	Turk	No; no high-five for you.
7126	Todd	Todd did bad?
7127	Turk	Todd did very bad. Todd did very, very bad.
7128	Turk	What the hell, Elliot? You can't just pawn this Bober guy off on me!
7129	Elliot	Hey, it was J.D.'s patient! I was just the middleman.... -Woman.... -Person.
7130	J.D.	Look, we can stand here and argue all day about who screwed who
7131	Elliot	Or?
7132	J.D.	Or nothing, I'm on break - let's do it.
7133	Turk	Okay, Rock-Paper-Scissors, right now.
7134	J.D.	Fine, loser gets Bober.
7135	Elliot	Once, twice, three: shoot!
7136	Granddaughter	Did you say "Bober"? I'm looking for my grandfather, Frank Bober.
7137	Nurse Roberts	We moved him to the ICU, dear. Uh, he'll show you up.
7138	Elliot	It's okay. She-she didn't hear us.
7139	Nurse Roberts	No. But Jesus did. Just a closer walk with thee....

7141	Dr. Cox	I didn't appreciate your little game this morning, there, Bobbo
7142	Dr. Kelso	Heavens to Betsy, the gaspacho is scrumptious today.
7143	Dr. Cox	...Danglin' that fake promotion right out in front of me.
7144	Dr. Kelso	I was dead-serious about the residency director's position.
7145	Dr. Cox	Well, what makes you think that I'd be interested in something like that?
7146	Dr. Kelso	Because you want my job, and you know that you'll never get it without this on your resume.
7147	Dr. Cox	But you hate me!
7148	Dr. Kelso	Like nuts in brownies, captain.
7149	Dr. Cox	Well, then, I don't get your angle. What could you possibly want from me in exchange for my support? Because I'm telling you right now, I am not dating that daughter of yours.
7150	Dr. Kelso	I only have a son.
7151	Dr. Cox	That's my bad - I was just going by that picture on your desk.
7152	Dr. Kelso	I'll tell you what I want: You know the financial burdens I have to deal with around here. I want you to stop busting my chops all the time and get on my team.
7153	Dr. Cox	Forget about it.
7154	Dr. Kelso	Fine. Walk away. Mmm. Scrumptious. Wan' bite?
7155	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
7156	Turk	We're doctors, you know? And that's just how doctors talk to other doctors.
7157	Elliot	Yeah. I mean, we were just joking around. I mean, our only mistake was not being careful about where we were.
7158	J.D.	That's right. We all agree we did nothing wrong; so let's just check in on him and forget about it.
7159	J.D.'s Narration	And that's when the three of us realized, even though we'd all spent time with Mr. Bober, none of us had any idea what he looked like.
7160	Carla	Over here.
7161	Mr. Bober	Hey, guys!
7162	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
7163	Re-open	Cafeteria
7164	J.D.'s Narration	When we started here a year ago, and saw some of the insensitive and jaded doctors, we all said the same thing: "That's not gonna be me." But really, the only solace is that the guilt passes pretty quickly.
7165	Mr. Bober	What's wrong, dawg?
7166	J.D.	You guys, we have to do something. If we remove Mr. Bober's gallbladder, it should relieve the recurrent abdominal pain.
7167	Carla	Isn't he a little old for that kind of procedure?
7168	Elliot	Well, he seems stable enough.
7169	Turk	Problem is, he has no insurance.
7170	J.D.'s Narration	And then, all at once, we realized we had to do something. We decided to attack the problem on three fronts.
7171	J.D.	Dr. Cox.
7172	Elliot	Ms. Sullivan?
7173	Turk	Dr. Wen.
7174	J.D.	So I thought if you looked at Mr. Bober's chart, and and you agreed with us, you might be able to, you know, pull some strings, er....
7175	J.D.'s Thoughts	And now, here it comes - the calling me a girl's name, the telling me not to waste my time....
7176	Dr. Cox	Yeah. I'll be more than glad to help you, there, Charlotte.
7177	J.D.'s Thoughts	I was half right.
7178	J.D.	W-well, th thank you!
7179	Dr. Cox	Don't ever be afraid to come to me with stuff like that. The simple fact that you actually seem to give a crap is the reason I took an interest in you to begin with. It's why I trust you as a doctor. Hell, it's...it's why I trust you as a person.
7180	J.D.	Are you dying?
7181	Dr. Cox	I've got a new shrink.
7182	J.D.'s Thoughts	Aw, just say it.
7183	J.D.	You know, Dr. Cox, I wanna thank you for this whole year
7184	Dr. Cox	Oh, no, no, no...no.
7185	J.D.	And I just wanna know...if I can buy you dinner.
7186	Dr. Cox	That'd be terrific.
7187	J.D.	Great! I'm off in, like, a half hour
7188	Dr. Cox	Oh, no. Here, I was led to believe that you were doing a gift certificate kind of thing. But, to sit and eat...with you, that's-that's just...that's crazy talk! I have half a mind to issue you a drug test. I mean, come on, what'd I sign up for
7189	J.D.	Would have been nice.
7190	Elliot	Well, he doesn't have insurance, so if you could talk to the other members of the board today at the meeting, well, J.D. thought maybe we could
7191	Jordan	"J.D. thought"? First he dumps that patient on you, and now he wants you to ask me a favor? Honey, if you don't start saying no to him soon, you're gonna wind up on the losing end of a little game I like to call Hide The Pickle.
7192	Elliot	Oh! J.D. and I are just colleagues.
7193	Jordan	Oh, my God; I was just joking, but you actually slept with him, didn't you?
7194	Elliot	Pff. ...A...little.
7195	Jordan	Look, I don't know where your mother was when she should have been telling you all these things, but you cannot have sex with someone you care about! Sex is for making babies and revenge.
7196	Elliot	Well, you're so full of it.
7197	Jordan	Listen, Stick, if you wanna wipe your nose and pretend that was a sneeze, I will play along. But if you have something to say, say it.
7198	Elliot	Everybody knows you're still sleeping with Dr. Cox; and it can't be about making babies 'cause you'd probably just end up eating them, anyway. And as for revenge, I'm just not sure that driving to his apartment and pleasuring him while he watches sports on TV is hurting him as much as you might think. So I have to figure that you still care about him, whether you want to admit it or not. And if you lay one finger on me, I'm blowing my rape whistle.
7199	Todd	Kiss her.
7200	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
7201	Turk	So you see, Dr. Wen, it's not really a favor - you were supposed to do surgery on Mrs. Beckerman, but she passed away this morning.
7202	Dr. Wen	Go on.
7203	Turk	Yeah, she's dead, and we were hoping that maybe you could keep her name on the roster? And, it's not-we don't wanna do surgery on her. Let's face it, Dr. Wen, we're good - but we're not that good, you know what I'm saying?
7204	Dr. Wen	No.
7205	Carla	Dr. Wen, we're trying to get a patient approved for surgery; we're hoping you can keep the slot open.
7206	Dr. Wen	Oh, sure. Dr. Turk, next time you need to talk to me, think hard about what you want to say, then send her.
7207	Turk	Of course. Thanks Dr. Wen!
7208	Carla	See, what happened there was, I knew what you were trying to say despite the exact words you were using; so I tried to help you out, instead of getting all mad at you over nothing.
7209	Turk	Right, baby, we both know it's not the same.
7210	Carla	You are the dumbest man I ever laid eyes on.
7211	Carla	Still.
7212	Todd	Didn't hurt! Didn't hurt!
7213	Turk	Uh-huh? Tell me if it hurts this time!
7214	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
7215	Dr. Kelso	So, you want me to approve surgery on a 76-year-old man with no insurance and no life-threatening condition. Young man, I'm curious: what did you think the end result of this conversation would be?
7216	J.D.	Well, pretty much this, except I'm really invested and so I thought I might try crying a little.
7217	Dr. Kelso	Sport, if crying worked on me, my wife would have her own car by now.
7218	Dr. Cox	Uh...Bob? I think you should reconsider.
7219	Dr. Kelso	Uh, what's that, Perry? I mean, because that didn't sound like something a team-mate would say. Maybe what you meant to do was pat me on the ass and say, "Go get 'em, Bob."
7220	Dr. Cox	Right but, what if...we were to look at this from a purely...fiscal perspective.
7221	J.D.'s Thoughts	Did he just say "fiscal"?
7222	Dr. Cox	I mean, after all, Mr. Bober is here every four to six months, and if we were to consider his surgery as a one-time expenditure, then...you would be making the right financial call.
7223	Dr. Kelso	See, now, that's the kind of thinking I can get behind! How's that make you feel?
7224	Dr. Cox	Dirty all over.
7225	Dr. Kelso	You get used to it. Boys, I'll do what I can, but if you're gonna pull this off, you're gonna need a board member behind you.
7226	J.D.'s Thoughts	How the hell we supposed to get that?
7227	Dr. Cox	This is the closest I've come to not hating myself after sleeping with you
7228	Jordan	Oh, you're just saying that.
7229	Dr. Cox	Actually, I'm not. I-we connected. What's wrong with you?
7230	Jordan	Nothing! I guess I was just thinking of a guy I kind of like.
7231	Dr. Cox	Lemme guess...lemme guess: He is an arrogant, self-hating narcissist who just needs to be loved.
7232	Jordan	Yeah, pretty much.
7233	Dr. Cox	Nobody better.
7234	Jordan	Hey, stud, thank you for not asking me to help out on the Mr. Bober thing.
7235	Dr. Cox	I would've but, it would have been pointless. It turns out, you're a very predictable woman, there, Jordan.
7236	Jordan	Puh-lease!
7237	Dr. Cox	I know you. You're gonna walk into that board room tonight, all tall and strong, and then you're gonna sit back and just pray that nobody asks your opinion. I mean, I'm sure you-you probably think that your little visits here are a spontaneous surprise, but, did you ever wonder why the only two candles that I own are already lit when you walk in that door? I mean, doll, I hate to tell you this but, I don't walk around all day with cologne down in my engine room. I'm not that guy!
7238	Jordan	Some people like reliability.
7239	Dr. Cox	In a sedan, it turns out it's terrific. Cheers.
7240	Dr. Cox	Here's the good news, however: It turns out, it's never too late to turn the whole thing around.
7241	Jordan	Really....
7242	Dr. Cox	All you gotta do is stir it up a little bit.
7243	Jordan	Stir it up?
7244	Dr. Cox	Stir it right the hell up.
7245	Jordan	I'll try to remember that.
7246	Dr. Cox	So I'm guessing, I'll be seeing you in about eleven days, right?
7247	Dr. Cox	Probably at the exact same time. Don't forget to stir it up, baby.

7256	Janitor	This door is broke, maybe the fifth time or so it don't open.
7257	Intern	Maybe there's a paper clip stuck in there?
7258	Janitor	Why a paper clip?
7259	Intern	I was just makin' small talk.
7260	Janitor	Did you put a paper clip in there?

7267	Jordan	Hey everyone.
7268	J.D.	Oh, Ms. Sullivan, thank you for helping us with Mr. Bober.
7269	Jordan	Oh, don't mention it! And even though I wasn't invited to your little party, I brought presents for everyone!
7270	Dr. Cox	Brace yourself, there, newbie.
7271	Jordan	Carla, my ex-husband is in love with you. It's true. Ask your boyfriend, he knows; he and Perry talk about it all the time. I don't know why you haven't mentioned this to her! Perhaps you're afraid of something? Huh. And Bob? When are you gonna tell Perry that that promotion you're making him jump through hoops for? was filled months ago! It just seems wrong. Which brings us to Twinkie. If you don't have the courage to tell your 'colleague' Dr. Dorian that you're still crazy about him, I'm gonna go ahead and do it for ya, 'cause that's what friends do. Yeah! And finally, Perry, you are not gonna believe what happened the first time I met your little protégé, here....
7272	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, please God, no.
7273	Jordan	I slept with him... and it was good - oh! How's that for stirring things up? Have a great summer, everyone. Bye!

7285	Jordan	And finally: Perry, you are not gonna believe what happened the first time I met your little protégé, here....!

7290	Turk	Good morning, Tiger.
7291	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, I've been wrong before.
7292	J.D.	How could you let a woman kick you out of your own bed?
7293	Turk	Baby, why you have to be so cranky in the morning?
7294	J.D.	This is unacceptable. You said we were gonna sleep head-to-foot.
7295	Turk	Dude, either way the naughty bits are still in the middle.
7296	J.D.	Yeah, but with the head-to-foot alignment, it's just there's no way for them to lock in.
7297	Turk	Could you be more homophobic?
7298	J.D.	Ugh. I'm not!
7299	J.D.	Ready to go?
7300	J.D.	Morning, boy.
7301	Carla	I can't remember the last time I was in this foul a mood.
7302	J.D.	Rowdy, no.

7310	J.D.	I had my shoes on, it would have been impossible to lock in.
7311	Turk	Everything's gonna be fine. Okay? Just be cool.

7349	J.D.'s Narration	Life in a hospital is made up of highs and lows. For instance, my spare pair of scrubs doesn't match, but I put my underwear in the microwave to dry them off, and they feel gooooooooooood.
7350	Nurse Roberts	What are you smiling at?
7351	J.D.	Could I have Mr. Buckley's chart, please?
7352	Nurse Roberts	No problem. I keep it right down there, in the 'Get it yourself' file.
7353	Dr. Cox	You know, Bob, I've been thinking about all the times that you've manipulated me and toyed with me, and, well, I can't help but recall that children's fable about the race between the tortoise and the pain-in-the-ass chief of medicine that everybody hates.
7354	Dr. Cox	You see, Bob, the pain-in-the-ass chief of medicine that everybody hates kept running out in front of the tortoise and taunting him; but right at the end gosh, I'm sure you remember what happened, Bob the tortoise bit clean-through the chief of medicine's calf muscle, dragged him to the ground, where he and all the other turtles devoured him alive, right there on the racetrack. It's a... disturbing children's book, Bob, I know, but it's one that stuck with me, nonetheless.
7355	Dr. Kelso	Buzzy, buzz, buzz....
7356	Dr. Cox	I...beg your pardon?
7357	Dr. Kelso	Oh, uh, that's the sound of all the bees in your bonnet. And, Perry, even though I could give a rat's ass, I still think it's a pretty sound!
7358	J.D.'s Narration	And just like that, it was my turn to face the music.
7359	J.D.'s Thoughts	Steady now.... Be brave.... Don't cry.
7360	Dr. Cox	Good morning!
7361	J.D.'s Thoughts	What the hell?
7362	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Dorian.
7363	J.D.	Woo!
7364	Dr. Kelso	Here you go, whiz-kid.
7365	J.D.	Ooh! Is that my new nickname? 'Cause, you know, I actually thought people were gonna start calling me that in high school when I was in our production of 'The Wiz'....
7366	J.D.	Yeah, it was the sort of the "hip" version of 'The Wizard of Oz'.... Nipsey Russell played the TinMan? "Come on and ease on down, ease on down the road!" Remember that? No? Well, anyway, you know, kids can be mean and everyone just started calling me "Dorothy." ...High school was hard....
7367	Dr. Kelso	Oh, I'm sorry, sport; I was thinking about soup. Now, Mr. Zerbo was initially admitted with a high fever and suspected meningitis; but, both the NCT and the lumbar puncture came back negative.
7368	J.D.	Uh...yeah, sir, I have a full patient load; I don't understand that you just drop this guy in my lap and expect me to make him a top priority.
7369	Dr. Kelso	You want me to say "ta da!" so it seems more like a trick? Mr. Zerbo back there is a major hospital benefactor. And, by golly, you know it's a lot harder to write a big, fat check if you're dead.
7370	J.D.	Neurology, rheumatology, hematology.... This guy's been turfed to every service in the hospital, no one knows what's wrong with him, what do you want me to do?
7371	Dr. Kelso	I hope it's navy bean today.
7372	J.D.	Dr. Kelso....
7373	Dr. Kelso	Well, gee, sport! I would say you should stop whining, find out what's wrong with him, and treat it; or you can be damn sure I'm going to give you something to whine about.
7374	J.D.	'Kay, fine! You know.... After all, I'm I'm the Whiz Kid!

7380	Todd	What's up, doll?
7381	Nurse Roberts	If you ever get this close again, I will end you.

7383	Turk	Carla, I'm sorry.
7384	Carla	For him? Not your fault.
7385	Turk	No, I'm talking about us. I'm sorry for what I did wrong.
7386	Carla	Which was?
7387	Turk	....You know....?
7388	Carla	See! You don't even realize why I'm upset. That's
7389	Carla	Why are you smiling?
7390	Turk	Because I set yo' ass up!
7391	Turk	Baby, I shoulda told you how Cox felt about you, and I was wrong for talking behind your back, which is a violation of the trust our relationship is based on. And that is why I'm sorry.
7392	Todd	My boy's got mad apologizin' skills!
7393	Turk	Todd, not now!
7394	Carla	You can't just point out the obvious you have to go deeper.
7395	Carla	And Todd, if you say, "That's what she said," I will brain you.
7396	Carla	Now, come on, Baby; connect with me why am I really upset?
7397	Turk	I'm gonna stick with the violation of trust thing final answer.
7398	Turk	Heh!

7416	Nurse Roberts	That's what she said.
7417	Carla	
7418	Dr. Cox	It's "don't start" in Spanish.
7419	Nurse Roberts	Bueno.
7420	J.D.'s Narration	I had planned to avoid Dr. Cox all day; but, unfortunately, I needed his help.
7421	J.D.	Dr. Cox, I have this, uh, patient, Mr. Zerbo, I can't quite
7422	J.D.'s Thoughts	Who knows.... Maybe he just decided to let the whole ex-wife thing go.
7423	Dr. Cox	Auto-immune serologies?
7424	J.D.	All negative.
7425	J.D.'s Thoughts	Then again, maybe he's just letting me stew for a while.
7426	Dr. Cox	Bone-marrow biopsy?
7427	J.D.	Negative.
7428	J.D.'s Thoughts	What kind of man tortures people like this!?!
7429	Dr. Cox	Afraid you got yourself a toughie.
7430	J.D.	Okay, fine: I'm sorry I slept with your ex-wife!
7431	Nurse Roberts	I think I'll sit back down.
7432	J.D.	It was an accident.
7433	Dr. Cox	Look.... First of all, it's not like you tripped and fell into her...and then out of her...and then into her...again. And, second of all, you're smart enough to know that I don't want to talk about this; I don't want to know where you did it; I don't even want to know...how it was.
7434	J.D.	A little scary Sorry! Jitters!
7435	J.D.'s Thoughts	And here come the fireworks....
7436	Dr. Cox	Lookit: I know you didn't have any idea who she was, and I understand why you were too nervous to tell me. So, whatta ya say we leave it at that? I forgive you; you are forgiven. Okay?

7444	J.D.	Did you find it?
7445	Elliot	No.
7446	Elliot	I must have left it at college.
7447	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, for God's sakes, would you throw her a rope?
7448	J.D.	I have no idea how to treat this patient. Help me out.
7449	J.D.'s Thoughts	Now, she's in a really awkward place; so just be sensitive.
7450	J.D.	I think we should sex each other.
7451	Elliot	I'm sorry?
7452	J.D.	Just hear me out: Our relationship ended so quickly, maybe too quickly, you know? And, now there's like these these feelings floating around, and I feel like we're always gonna regret it if we don't...see if they lead somewhere.
7453	J.D.	What do you think?
7454	J.D.	I can't believe how weird it feels to be back here again.
7455	Turk	Yeah.... But it seems so right.
7456	J.D.	If Carla's so mad, I don't understand why she doesn't just crash at her own place.
7457	Turk	Oh, she is back at her place.
7458	J.D.	What are you talking about, Willis?
7459	Turk	That's pretty funny!
7460	Turk	We should make that one of our things.
7461	J.D.	Yeah, I know.
7462	Carla	That's stupid.
7463	Turk	I think I'd really panic if she went back to her place.
7464	Turk	J.D., this sucks.
7465	J.D.	Yeah. You know what's weird, though? It's like, Dr. Cox and I are pretty vegan-kosher.
7466	Turk	He hasn't yelled at you?
7467	J.D.	No.

7475	Dr. Cox	Huh. Probably ought to try and find that.
7476	J.D.'s Narration	...he didn't care about me anymore.
7477	Janitor	Yep, that's a leaky o-ring. I can fix her...but...I don't got the parts in stock. We need an o-ring down here!

7527	Dr. Cox	No, I'm not.
7528	J.D.	And you won't admit this, but you're in love with Carla.
7529	Carla	No, he's not.
7530	Dr. Cox	Actually, I am.
7531	Carla	You're starting again.
7532	J.D.	And Carla, you're mad that Turk didn't trust you enough to tell you.
7533	Turk	See? Trust, woman, trust!
7534	J.D.	Whatever. The point is that Turk is sorry.
7535	Turk	Not anymore!
7536	Carla	I can't believe you thought he was a threat.
7537	Dr. Cox	I'm a threat!
7538	Carla	You're not in love with me, you idealize me.
7539	J.D.	Can we just try and stay focused
7540	Turk	You're mad 'cause I'm scared of losing you?
7541	Carla	Yes, because we're stronger than that!

7545	Dr. Cox	Oprah's right!
7546	Turk	Lay off of him.

7609	Jordan	Mm-hmm. Say, let's play a game: I'll throw out an adjective describing how one of you is in bed, and you guys try to guess who it is!
7610	J.D.	Remember, I had no idea she was your ex at the time.
7611	Dr. Cox	Heh?
7612	Jordan	Okay. Clumsy!
7613	Dr. Cox	Don't answer that, Newbie.
7614	J.D.	No worries.
7615	Dr. Cox	Goodbye, Jordan. Sandy.
7616	J.D.	Ow!
7617	Jordan	Good job, D.J.
7618	J.D.	You know, it's J.D. Okay? And at least I remember the names of all my sexual partners.
7619	Jordan	Well, I'm sure that girl from high school and your bunk-mate from Camp Morning Wood are both extremely grateful. Yeah.
7620	J.D.	It was Camp Meadow Wood. ...I made a lanyard.
7621	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
7622	J.D.'s Narration	It sounds insensitive, but hospitals can be kind of boring. So if a policeman gets into an accident with the bad guy he's chasing, well, it pumps ya up!
7623	J.D.	Okay, move it along, fellas, there's nothing to see here. I'll be over here.
7624	Carla	Officer Berson was admitted with shortness of breath and chest pain.
7625	Elliot	Hey, J.D., do you think anyone else gets this excited over a car accident?
7626	J.D.	Maybe Hank....
7627	J.D.'s Narration	We weren't the only ones psyched to be in the game.
7628	Turk	The doctor is in. Bad guy, this is why you don't run from the po-lice! Baby, are you ready to rock?
7629	Nurse	Great. Another cocky resident that wants to start surgery before the attending shows up.
7630	Turk	I'm sorry; I just figured that if we finished here quick enough, we might have enough time to pull the stick outta your ass. Whatta you say?
7631	Dr. Kelso	Perry.
7632	Dr. Cox	Beelzebob. Lackey!
7633	Lawyer	Hey, Dr. Cox.
7634	Dr. Kelso	I'm being honored tonight by the board of trustees, and they asked me to say a few words.
7635	Dr. Cox	Oh! Yawn.
7636	Dr. Kelso	Anyway, I would like you to be the one who introduces me.
7637	Dr. Cox	Wow. Seriously?
7638	Dr. Kelso	Yeah!
7639	Dr. Cox	Not interested.
7640	Dr. Kelso	I didn't ask if you were interested.
7641	Dr. Cox	Bob, I deeply dislike you. Honestly, it keeps me up at night.
7642	Dr. Kelso	Well, then, use that passion! Put that rage on the page!
7643	Dr. Cox	Here's an idea: Why not use Big Chief Flop-Sweat, here?
7644	Dr. Kelso	Ted's not an impressive man.
7645	Lawyer	Hey....! That Ah, he's right.
7646	Dr. Cox	Okay.
7647	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
7648	Elliot	Officer Berson, you have a slight arrhythmia, so Dr. Dorian and I are going to monitor you very closely.
7649	J.D.	But don't worry, we're on top of it, okay?
7650	J.D.'s Thoughts	There's nothing like that feeling of really taking charge of a situation.
7651	Dr. Cox	Mary. Rhoda. Chart, please.
7652	Dr. Cox	What'd I stutter? Gimme the chart. Atta girl. Ew. Man. I don't like his 0-2 set. Grab me a doughnut, will ya?
7653	Elliot	Oh, you mean like a um a blood-pressure thingie?
7654	Dr. Cox	I mean like a glazed thingie. And I like sprinkles on half of it; so if you can't find a half sprinkled, get me all sprinkles and just go ahead and pick half of 'em off.
7655	J.D.	You know that was...kind of demeaning.
7656	Dr. Cox	You know, you're right. Would you do me a favor and apologize to her while you get me some coffee. And please be quick, otherwise I'm just gonna have the manager send over a different waitress. Go. You're done now. Yeah.
7657	J.D.'s Narration	The frustrating thing was, down in the OR, Turk was probably running the show.
7658	Attending	Steady, Dr. Turk; only about two more hours.
7659	Turk	Could you scratch my nose, please.
7660	Nurse	No. I can scratch _my_ nose. Oh, that feels good.
7661	Turk	Yeah.
7662	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
7663	Dr. Kelso	Miss Sullivan, I just want to thank you and the rest of the board for giving me this award. The fact that your first choice passed away last weekend in no way makes it any less special.
7664	Jordan	Are you sure? 'Cause it seems like it does.
7665	Dr. Cox	Hey, Bob. As far as the whole intro thing goes, I've actually gone ahead and given it a lot of thought, but I'm afraid I'm gonna very politely have to tell you to blow it out your ass.
7666	Dr. Kelso	I think we both understand how this works. It's like when my dog Baxter goes winkle on the carpet: He always heads right straight away from the tool shed, but we both know that's where he's gonna spend the night.
7667	Jordan	Charming story.
7668	Dr. Cox	Yeah. The fact of the matter is, I kinda make it a rule never to get in bed with people that I have nothing but contempt for.
7669	Dr. Cox	Oh.
7670	Jordan	That feels gooood, J.D.
7671	Dr. Cox	You'll now pay for that.
7672	Jordan	God, I hope so.
7673	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
7674	Elliot	You guys, we're residents now. We're supposed to have more responsibility, you know?
7675	Turk	I scratched my nose with Bad Guy's toe.
7676	J.D.	I think we just have to accept the fact that we're the most under-appreciated people at this hospital.
7677	Carla	Oh, Bambi, I really feel for you.
7678	J.D.	Thank you!
7679	Turk	She doesn't.
7680	Carla	J.D., I spend most of my time here getting orders barked at me by people who take credit for my work and blame me for their mistakes. And all the while, I'm expected to hold the doctor's hand. You should try trading places with me for one day.
7681	J.D.	It's actually not that bad. And the lace feels soft against my package.
7682	J.D.'s Thoughts	Nah.
7683	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
7684	Dr. Cox	Well, I'm glad we finally had a chance to, uh, talk.
7685	Jordan	You and me, both. I mean, I haven't had anyone to _talk_ to lately.
7686	Dr. Cox	Whoa-kay.
7687	Jordan	But boy, you sure do talk fast.
7688	Dr. Cox	Bye-bye!
7689	Jordan	Next time we talk, maybe I could finish a sentence or two.
7690	Carla	You still like her.
7691	Dr. Cox	Why, because we had a conversation in an empty room?
7692	Carla	That room's not empty.
7693	Dr. Cox	Listen, girlfriend, I don't wanna hear your misguided romantic notions. You see, for me, sex is a sport like racquet-ball: You play hard for a half an hour, work up a sweat, and hope you don't get hit in the eye.
7694	Carla	Say what you want, I know you care about her. In fact, I bet that after you two are done playing racquet-ball or talking or whatever you crazy kids are calling it, you'd like nothing better than to just lie there and pass the time by watching her sleep.
7695	Dr. Cox	Carla, it's impossible to actually lie next to Jordan, seeing as she sleeps hanging upside-down from the ceiling, wrapped in a cocoon of her own wings.
7696	Carla	That's nice.
7697	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
7698	Janitor	Hey. I thought about what you said, and you're right I owe you...so, I got you a date tonight.
7699	J.D.	Who?
7700	Janitor	Tim.
7701	J.D.	I'm not gay.
7702	Janitor	Huh? Oh! Oh.... I get it. Neither is Tim.
7703	J.D.'s Narration	Unfortunately, I'm on-call tonight, and as weird as this place is during the day...it's even worse at night. See, that's when all the weirdos come out.
7704	J.D.'s Narration	Like the ER doctor who likes to work nights 'cause he says he's up anyway.
7705	ER Doc	Hey, bro.
7706	J.D.'s Narration	Or the nurse who everyone agrees is just a little bit off.
7707	J.D.'s Narration	Or, if there's a full moon....
7708	Lawyer	Hey. This is my band. We all work in different departments in the hospital.
7709	J.D.	Ted, I know, you told me last time that we
7710	Lawyer	Legal
7711	Randall	Accounting
7712	Crispin	Shipping and Receiving
7713	Roy	On-site property management including pest control, night-time security, non-arboreal gardening services, and tenant-related easements and liens.
7714	J.D.	Hey, you got promoted!
7715	The Band	And it's about time. He's/I've been busting his/my hump around here for six years. Mm-mmm.
7716	Lawyer	Dr. Kelso lets us practice here at night.
7717	J.D.	Oh, yeah, I remember, the uh cartoon theme songs.
7718	Lawyer	No, no, no. That was lame. We do prime-time now.
7719	J.D.	Hey. So, what attendings are stuck here on-call tonight?
7720	Turk	Everyone's at that Kelso thing.
7721	Elliot	I think Dr. Cox is on.
7722	Carla	No, he went home. But he said that Carol could cover for him.
7723	Turk	Is Carol the one with the really firm butt?
7724	J.D.	Well, I'm "Carol", so yes.
7725	Elliot	It's disturbing how obsessed you are with your own butt.
7726	J.D.	Oh, come on. You guys are missing the point: No one is here tonight but us, we are running this hospital.
7727	Turk	This is our house!
7728	Elliot	We're in charge!
7729	J.D.	I love my butt!
7730	J.D.'s Narration	It's amazing how one moment you think you know exactly what you want....
7731	Dr. Cox	Oh, God. Come on.
7732	J.D.'s Narration	...And then the next moment, everything changes.
7733	Carla	Okay, Elliot: The ER doctor knows there's no attending up here, so instead of treating-&-streeting people, he's just admitting everyone. You've got twelve so far.
7734	Carla	Turk: Oncology, Cardiology, and Pediatrics all need surgical consults...plus
7735	Carla	That phone is for you. It's the clinic they, too, know you're on your own so they're just patching all their night calls right on through.
7736	Carla	And Bambi: Room 201 needs an art-line, Room 202 needs reintubation; plus, Carol, you're needed in ICU to place a femoral swan under flu on Mr. Freed.
7737	J.D.	Never actually...done one of these unsupervised before.
7738	J.D.'s Narration	And that's when I realized, tonight we really were all alone running the hospital.
7739	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
7740	Re-open	The Hospital – Nurses' Station
7741	J.D.'s Narration	Luckily, someone had the guts to stand up and take charge.
7742	Carla	Look, you've all been on-call before. So, you don't have a safety-net. Most of the time you don't need one, anyway, right?
7743	Carla	Fine. I'll just go tell your patients that they're on their own because you're all too scared.
7744	J.D.	No, Carla. I'm the doctor. I should tell them.
7745	Elliot	Come on, peeps! Let's go kick some sick patient ass!
7746	J.D.	That, my friends, is one nerdy honky!
7747	Turk	That's two.
7748	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
7749	Jordan	My back hurts.
7750	Dr. Cox	Oh, yeah? Well my front hurts, so touche.
7751	Jordan	Ah, always a charmer. Hi.
7752	Dr. Cox	Hi. I'm gonna go ahead and get you a big, ice-cold glass of water. Whatta you think of that?
7753	Dr. Cox	Ohhh, sweet mother of mercy, Carla, you were right. You were so right.
7754	Carla	Of course.
7755	Dr. Cox	Just exactly what in the hell am I supposed to do now?
7756	Carla	Duck.
7757	Dr. Cox	Wha !
7758	Turk	Who let that damn clinic page me 'cause a patient thinks their tongue is too spongy!? Huh!? Who!?
7759	Dr. Cox	Under no circumstances are you to tell any of them that I'm here.
7760	Carla	Yeah, yeah. Look: Why don't you just go home and tell Jordan how you feel.
7761	Dr. Cox	Tell a woman how I feel?
7762	Carla	Well, I guess you could duck.
7763	Dr. Cox	Uh!
7764	Elliot	Carla, this is ridiculous! He admitted out of Cardiology because he has heartburn! I hate ER docs!
7765	Dr. Cox	You just...don't understand my relationship with Jordan.
7766	Carla	Duck.
7767	Dr. Cox	Hah!
7768	Dr. Cox	Now that's just not funny.
7769	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
7770	J.D.'s Narration	I don't know why I was scared of placing a femoral swan, I guess I just couldn't stop wishing there was someone over my shoulder. I was...even starting to see things.
7771	J.D.	Okay, Mr. Freed. I think I can do this.
7772	Mr. Freed	Hm!?
7773	J.D.	I'm gonna need a c-arm in here!
7774	Janitor	Want me to knock him out?
7775	J.D.	What are you doing in here?
7776	Janitor	I owe ya. I'm helping you out.
7777	J.D.	This this isn't like being a janitor, okay! It's not just like something everybody can do.
7778	Janitor	Oh. So you can do my stuff, but I can't do yours.
7779	J.D.	YES!
7780	Janitor	Okay, hotshot, what would you use to get a coffee stain up off a tile floor?
7781	J.D.	I don't know, the...rough side of a sponge?
7782	Janitor	Dammit.
7783	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
7784	Carla	Officer Berson's spiraling a bit.
7785	Elliot	His pulmonary edema seems to be secondary to acute mitral regurgitation. If it turns out to be a __________, he'll need surgery.
7786	Turk	Yeah, but his vitals are so weak, I wouldn't feel confident about taking him to the OR.
7787	J.D.'s Thoughts	Ahh, the classic Catch-22 between Medical and Surgical. Bottom-line, somebody needs to be decisive.
7788	J.D.	Okay, here's the plan: We do nothing.
7789	Elliot	Sounds good.
7790	Turk	I'm in.
7791	Carla	That's inspiring.
7792	J.D.	We'll meet back here in a few hours and see if his vitals have improved.
7793	Turk	Yeah. This ends now.
7794	J.D.'s Narration	Turk should've known that the worst mistake a doctor can possibly make is setting foot in the hospital's free clinic at night.
7795	Turk	I don't care if you do shave down there. That's not even a medical issue! But it sure is pretty!
7796	Turk	Ma'am, you don't have mono. But you do have halitosis. Mint?
7797	Turk	Ma'am, three baby Tylenol is actually an under-dose for a woman your size.
7798	Turk	OH!
7799	Turk	Yes, congratulations, you _are_ double-jointed.
7800	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
7801	Elliot	Look, I just thought we'd talk to you up here about it so you could see that we don't have any more beds and we really can't handle any more patients.
7802	ER Doc	Okay. You talk way too fast.
7803	Elliot	If you could just keep one person downstairs, we'd be willing to throw a parade for you!
7804	Carla	She needs you to give her a break.
7805	ER Doc	Oh. Well, tell her that we're really swamped.
7806	Carla	She can understand you!
7807	Elliot	Uh-huh! Yeah!
7808	ER Doc	Well then, uh, understand this: Chill out, bitty.

7810	Dr. Cox	Hey.
7811	Jordan	Hey. Didn't you go to get water, like, an hour ago?
7812	Dr. Cox	More or less, yeah.
7813	Dr. Cox	Hey, Jordan, there's something I really want to say to you....
7814	Jordan	But can you say it while I'm drinking water? Because I'm really dying of thirst
7815	Dr. Cox	I like you...again. There, you win. You can ahead and do your victory dance or slaughter a goat or whatever it is you do when you're happy.
7816	Jordan	You don't like me.
7817	Dr. Cox	I watch you when you sleep.
7818	Jordan	Well that just gives me the heebie-jeebies.
7819	Dr. Cox	I can't stop thinking about putting up with you.
7820	Jordan	Look: This is pointless, angry, shallow sex! Why would you go and ruin something like that?
7821	Dr. Cox	I'm real sorry, but that's just not enough for me anymore.
7822	Jordan	Sweetie, I have feelings for you, too; I do. But unlike you, I have some balls, so you don't hear me whining about it. Look, Perry, I can't let you back into my life, and watch you personally and professionally sabotage every single chance that you get. It's too hard. I can't do it.
7823	Dr. Cox	I've changed. I have. I see a shrink now; I actually see two, tell you the truth. Good God, what do you want me to do to prove that I'm not that guy anymore?
7824	Jordan	Hmm...
7825	Dr. Kelso	There you are! Had to make me sweat, didn't ya! Good for you, buckaroo. Here. I took the liberty of writing out my introduction.
7826	Dr. Cox	Oh! "Bob Kelso is...the love of my life."
7827	Dr. Kelso	My wife was going to do it.
7828	Dr. Cox	She doesn't even seem to be here, Bob.
7829	Dr. Kelso	Eh. What're you gonna do?
7830	Dr. Cox	Heh!
7831	Jordan	Lovely.
7832	Dr. Cox	Heh.

7834	Janitor	You rang. Lurch.
7835	J.D.	Oh. Um. My stethoscope is stuck up there, and I need you to get it down for me.
7836	Janitor	You put it up there.
7837	J.D.	It's really neither here nor there.
7838	Janitor	Fine. All right, we're even.
7839	J.D.	Thank God.
7840	Janitor	You know you could have just asked me to stop hassling you for, like, a year?
7841	J.D.	Okay, I want that, then.
7842	Janitor	It's too late.
7843	J.D.	But I...use those...for listening.
7844	Nurse	Oh, uh, they want you upstairs in room, um, 208.
7845	J.D.	His vitals are exactly the same. There's gotta be one attending in this stupid hospital.
7846	Carla	You guys are unbelievable.
7847	Turk	Oh, thank you, baby.
7848	Carla	Not the good kind.
7849	Turk	I know!
7850	Carla	You all claim you want more responsibility.... But you're being outsmarted by a doctor who wears scrubs made out of hemp; you're afraid to stand up to a volunteer who's answering the clinic phones; and Bambi, did you ever place that femoral swan?
7851	J.D.	It's on my to-do list.
7852	Carla	Now I know you're all hoping Officer Berson's vitals will go up or down and this decision will be made for you, but guess what? Nothing's changed. So it's on you.
7853	J.D.'s Narration	We all knew what we had to do.
7854	J.D.	Surgery.
7855	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes, just making a decision is half the battle.
7856	Lawyer	Gentlemen, we can rebuild him. We have the technology. We can make him better than he was before. Better. Stronger. Faster.

7860	J.D.'s Narration	In moments of truth, we always reveal who we really are.
7861	Dr. Cox	Bob Kelso is an awful, awful man.
7862	Dr. Cox	I'm not joking. He's the devil. What's wrong with you people? This is
7863	Dr. Kelso	Yeah! Great stuff, Perry! Great stuff! Is this guy a hoot, or what?
7864	Dr. Kelso	I'll have your ass for this.
7865	Dr. Cox	Jor Jordan!
7866	Dr. Kelso	Thank you, thank you.
7867	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes, we're our own worst enemy.
7868	J.D.'s Narration	And sometimes, we rise to the occasion.
7869	J.D.	Everything went, uh, really well.
7870	J.D.'s Narration	Even though we all know that tomorrow morning, the three of us'll go back to being the most unappreciated people in the whole damn hospital.
7871	Nurse	Hey, what are you doing here? I thought you were off last night?
7872	Carla	I switched shifts to help some friends out. Have a good one.

7879	Turk	Elliot.
7880	Elliot	Yes, please!
7881	Carla	Me too, babe?
7882	J.D.	I'll give you a hand.
7883	J.D.'s Narration	When you spend most of your time together as a part of a group, if you're left alone, it can get pretty awkward. There can be...uncomfortable silences.
7884	Elliot	Th-th-that-that was-that was my tummy.
7885	Carla	Oh, right.
7886	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Murphy, describe the presentation of Ludwig's Angina.
7887	Doug	Uh...
7888	J.D.'s Narration	Still, it's nothing compared to the silence you can hear at work.
7889	Dr. Kelso	Proud to have you on board, son. Anyway, I'm sending one of you to an AMA conference where you're going to eat free food, stay at a nice hotel, and try your darnedest not to embarrass this hospital. And in the interest of fairness, I drew a name out of a hat and that name was Elliot Reid.
7890	Elliot	Yes! I never win at anything!
7891	Dr. Kelso	And then I thought Oh, who cares what I thought the point is, you're not going.
7892	Dr. Kelso	You see, it seems as though all you lazy bones have forgotten my edict about residents publishing case reports. That's why I've decided that whoever brings me the most interesting case gets the ticket to Reno.
7893	Doug	You know, sir, my parents live in Reno.
7894	Dr. Kelso	Well, that's just great, sport; I'm sure you'll see them over Christmas.
7895	Dr. Kelso	Criminy.
7896	J.D.'s Narration	There aren't many things that can make the Chief of Medicine move that fast. But whenever we get a patient who has the same name as a wing of the hospital, you can pretty much predict Kelso's behavior.
7897	Dr. Kelso	Would you like it, uh, high up on the cheek? Or do you prefer this fleshy part in the middle?
7898	Mrs. Warner	I'm trying to decide who's the most detestable suck-up here - you? This feminine guy with the perm?
7899	Guy	Mom! Please.
7900	Mrs. Warner	Or the one in the corner who can't seem to stop daydreaming.
7901	J.D.	I'm sorry, what?
7902	Mrs. Warner	Oh, great, another sycophant.
7903	Dr. Cox	Listen up, there, Molly Menopause, I need you to quiet the hell down, you're scaring everyone in the hospital. I mean, my God - they're delivering a baby upstairs, and the poor kid's using the umbilical cord to crawl the hell back in.
7904	Mrs. Warner	Now you listen to me
7905	Dr. Cox	I mean it, sister.
7906	Mrs. Warner	Okay. From now on, he's my doctor. The rest of you can get the hell out of here.

7912	Mrs. Warner	You can drop the macho act now, dear, they're gone.
7913	Dr. Cox	Yak, schmack, the lips stay zipped.
7914	J.D.	Zipped, schmipped.
7915	J.D.	Oh, I thought we were riffing.
7916	Dr. Cox	Yeah, we're not.
7917	Mrs. Warner	Well, aren't you delicious. If I were twenty years younger and slightly tipsy, this might be your lucky day.
7918	Dr. Cox	Careful, there, sweet-cheeks. I haven't decided which way I'm going to take your temperature yet.
7919	J.D.	Wow. She had some real old-fashioned sass. I mean, you just don't see sass like that anymore.
7920	Dr. Cox	Stop saying sass.
7921	J.D.	Sass.
7922	Doug	Ummmmmmm. Dr. Cox? I have a patient with blennorrhea, and I was wondering if you thought that was interesting enough to present to Dr. Kelso?
7923	Dr. Cox	Gosh, I'm sorry, nervous guy, but I just can't do your work for you. But, what do you say you head on down to the library and look it up in the New England Journal of Who Gives a Rat's Ass? You've got to leave this instant - this second - this moment. Just go.
7924	Dr. Cox	Boy. Now tell me this, muffin: You're not gonna be like all the other mindless drones trying to turn the sniffles into something much more fascinating just so you're the one who's selected to go to this stupid conference, are you?
7925	J.D.'s Narration	I felt I knew the right answer.
7926	J.D.	No...?
7927	Dr. Cox	Ohh! Good girl.

7929	Dr. Kelso	Nurse Roberts. I just saw your patient in 106, and I've decided that the next time you place an IV and actually hit the vein on the first try, I'm gonna crack open a bottle of bubbly. I mean, my God, woman, the man looks like Al Jarreau was his nurse.
7930	Nurse Roberts	What?
7931	Dr. Kelso	Isn't he the blind fellow?
7932	Nurse Roberts	You mean Ray Charles?
7933	Dr. Kelso	Dammit. Anyway, you're incompetent.
7934	Nurse Roberts	Easy, Laverne. You're a saved woman!
7935	Carla	Don't worry. Remember tomorrow's his wedding anniversary.
7936	Elliot	Why does that matter?
7937	Dr. Cox	'Cause right about tomorrow, Bob Kelso will be sweeter than flowers dipped in honey.
7938	Dr. Wen	Which is why every year we use this time as an opportunity to ask him for anything our department needs. Like equipment.
7939	Carla	Or an extra nurse on weekends.
7940	Todd	Or a Slip 'n Slide! Who's with me!?
7941	???	Shut up.
7942	Turk	I don't get it, Dr. Wen. Why would Kelso's anniversary make him less of a jerk than usual?
7943	Dr. Wen	Well, tonight after work, Dr. Kelso will take his wife to a candlelit dinner. Then, after they've toasted to forty wonderful years together, they'll go home and....
7944	Dr. Cox	Oh! Bam! Oh! Bam!
7945	Carla	I actually think it's really sweet that at their age they still....
7946	Dr. Cox	Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!
7947	Turk	And then Bam! Dr. Wen points to me, and now guess who has to go ask Dr. Kelso for a new Argon Laser tomorrow?
7948	Carla	I'm sorry, baby.
7949	Turk	I'm outta here.
7950	Carla	All right.
7951	Turk	Damn Argon Laser.
7952	Elliot	Carla, do you think we'd hang out as much if it weren't for J.D. and Turk?
7953	Carla	Uhhhh.... Probably not. I mean, they are the one thing we have most in common.
7954	Elliot	We have a lot in common! I mean, we both have a hard time digesting dairy!
7955	Carla	You're right! Do you want to be my maid of honor?
7956	Carla	Elliot. I don't know why you're tying to force this. We're fine! I gotta get back to work.
7957	Elliot	We both work.
7958	Doug	So...have you found any cool cases yet?
7959	J.D.	Look, muffin, I'm not gonna run around this hospital like the rest of you mindless drones trying to turn the sniffles into something fascinating just so you can go to some stupid conference.... Schmonference.
7960	J.D.'s Thoughts	It's fun to rhyme!
7961	Elliot	What's stupid? It's an amazing networking opportunity. Doesn't matter, though, 'cause I've got it wrapped up, anyway.
7962	Doug	Why, do you have something better than my guy with blennorrhea?
7963	Elliot	Doug, if I told you, you would not believe it.
7964	***Fantasy Sequence	
7965	Elliot	And, as you can see, the ass is on the front.

7967	J.D.	Front butt.... It's like the grail.
7968	Elliot	Oh, did you say something, Mr. Too Scared To Get In The Game?
7969	J.D.'s Thoughts	Don't get sucked in!
7970	J.D.	You know, I have an interesting patient, too.
7971	J.D.	So, basically, Mr. Davis, you received a blunt trauma to the fibrous tissue of the corpus cavernosum.
7972	Mike	Great, and that means....?
7973	J.D.	You broke your penis.
7974	Mike	Wow. I can't wait to get my cast signed.
7975	J.D.	I-I gotta tell you, it's such an unusual case.... Would you mind if I try and get it published in a medical journal?
7976	Mike	That would be fantastic!
7977	J.D.	I'll let you...mull it over. And smile, Mr. Davis - tomorrow's gonna be a better day...for everyone.

7985	Elliot	Oh, Mrs. Kellerman's my patient, too. I traded with Doug so we could talk.
7986	Mrs. Kellerman	Oh, are you two friends?
7987	Elliot	We're about to be.
7988	Carla	Oh, my God.
7989	Elliot	You're still stuck on your first impression of me: That I am some narrow-minded, spoiled brat.
7990	Carla	Elliot, not now, okay?
7991	Elliot	When I was a kid, I was really close with my maid.
7992	Carla	That's it.
7993	Carla	So you think that you totally get my whole experience because you spent time with a Latina woman who cleaned your house?
7994	Elliot	What are you talking about? Our maid was white.
7995	Carla	What was her name?
7996	Elliot	C-Consuela.
7997	Elliot	Look, you know that I don't always say the right thing, but you also know how hard I'm trying! So, yeah, I guess you're right - we have nothing in common, because I only have things in common with nice people.
7998	Carla	Oh, so

8004	J.D.	For how long?
8005	Janitor	Uhh, I don't know.
8006	J.D.	Well, why? What do you have to do?
8007	Janitor	Nothin'. Might just veg.
8008	J.D.	No, seriously, try me I can deal with anything.
8009	Nurse Roberts	Go away.
8010	J.D.	"Go aschmay."
8011	Nurse Roberts	All right, try this one....
8012	Dr. Cox	Angie. Put on your flats, we're going for a walk.
8013	J.D.	"Eat _schmit_ and die."
8014	J.D.'s Narration	Around here, life can be full of surprises. Some are as simple as forgetting something you were supposed to ask for....
8015	Turk	Dr. Kelso! Is he gone?
8016	J.D.'s Narration	Some are so unexpected that everything else takes a back-seat.
8017	Elliot	I'm sorry, Mrs. Kellerman, I don't even know what kind of surgery you're having.
8018	Mrs. Kellerman	I'm getting big, fake breasts.
8019	J.D.'s Narration	And some you never thought you'd hear.
8020	Dr. Cox	Listen, Newbie, I don't tell you I respect you a lot because, well, I don't.
8021	J.D.	I know.
8022	Dr. Cox	But, I gotta say, the fact that you're not jumping through Kelso's hoops like the rest of these peons
8023	Dr. Cox	Yes, you. Forever you. A thousand times you. Move!
8024	Doug	Ow.
8025	Dr. Cox	Anyway, let's make pretend it's your birthday or something, because I'm...ah, hell, I'm impressed.
8026	Dr. Cox	Let's get some coffee.

8038	J.D.'s Narration	Thank God my hypocrisy missed me.
8039	Janitor	The reason I wanted you to stand in line for me is 'cause I needed a new mop. See, the floors are all slippery 'cause this one doesn't work. You know why it doesn't work?
8040	J.D.	It's out of mop gas?
8041	Janitor	No. 'Cause it's so old it won't soak up water.
8042	Janitor	See?
8043	J.D.'s Narration	Something in that filthy mop water woke me up. I decided I could have my cake and eat it, too.
8044	J.D.'s Narration	Dr. Cox would never know.
8045	Dr. Cox	Whatta ya say, there, bridge club? How ya feelin'?
8046	Mrs. Warner	I feel like crap. What the hell's wrong with me?
8047	Dr. Cox	Your abdominal pain suggests you have biliary disease, but all your tests came back negative so...we don't exactly know what's wrong with you.
8048	J.D.	But don't worry - Dr. Cox and I never say die!
8049	J.D.	Unless, of course, someone actually dies; then we're kind of forced to by law.
8050	Mrs. Warner	He's talking again.
8051	Dr. Cox	Ohh, come on, the kid's okay.
8052	J.D.'s Thoughts	"The kid"? This is great.
8053	Mrs. Warner	So, why haven't I heard your name before?
8054	J.D.	Well, I've only been here a year, and he's actually just started calling me "The Kid" - which I love, by the way.
8055	Dr. Cox	She's talking to me, pumpkin.
8056	J.D.	Okay.
8057	Mrs. Warner	Seriously, you should be more than just an attending; let me make a phone call.
8058	Dr. Cox	I'm...not so good with hand-outs.
8059	Mrs. Warner	Well, come on, I'm only putting in a good word.
8060	Dr. Cox	I'll tell you what, there, bubby: If you really wanna help me, why don't you quiet down and get yourself some rest. And then, if you're a really good girl, I'll wind up your car and take you out to a talkie.

8069	Elliot	Yeah, I know! I'm sure she gets it all the time!

8112	Dr. Cox	Good news, Mrs. Warner: I think we got a pretty good idea what's going on in there....
8113	J.D.'s Thoughts	So I don't have a case to present. At least this way, we get to stay a team.
8114	Dr. Cox	So, anyway, it turns out the EGD showed multiple erosive peptic ulcers, and the secretin injection test was positive, all of which suggest that you have gastrinomas in Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome.
8115	Mrs. Warner	In English, please!
8116	Dr. Cox	Your stomach acid is eroding your own intestines. It's remarkable - I've never actually seen anything like it before. Newbie, you?
8117	J.D.	No.
8118	J.D.'s Narration	And that's when I realized Mrs. Warner was the most interesting case in the hospital.
8119	Dr. Cox	Whole thing's very treatable. We're gonna step outside, and then we'll get underway - how's that sound?
8120	Dr. Cox	Newbie, whatta you say?
8121	J.D.'s Narration	I just had to go for it.
8122	J.D.	Actually, if you could just give me a second, I want to ask Mrs. Warner something.
8123	Dr. Cox	What?
8124	J.D.	To marry me.
8125	Dr. Cox	Come on - heel, toe - whatta you say, kid?
8126	J.D.	Mrs. Warner, I was wondering if you'd give me permission to present your case to possibly be published in a national medical journal, so that I might be chosen to go to an AMA conference.
8127	Mrs. Warner	Sure. Why not.

8133	Turk	Look: I need an argon laser and I was gonna ask you yesterday but then all of a s Hold up. How can you make love to your wife if she's at fat camp?
8134	Dr. Kelso	The real question is, how can I make love to her when she's not at fat camp?
8135	Turk	Sir, you lied to us.
8136	Dr. Kelso	Hi! I'm Bob Kelso, nice to meet you.
8137	Dr. Kelso	Look, sport: If people think I'm only giving once a year, they'll only be asking me for things once a year. Capiche? Now get out of my eyeline - Nurse Tisdale's wearing ankle-socks today.
8138	Turk	How 'bout I don't. And how about you help me out, and I won't tell anybody about this. Unless you like it when people come and ask you for stuff, like, every single day.

Just remember, when you are posing and prancing in front of the judges, to keep that shaved behind of yours held up nice and high like the proud little puppy that you are. Then when it comes time to hand out those blue ribbons, it'll be such an exciting time for you - it really will be - but for the love of God, Newbie, you gotta try, try, try not to squeeze out a dookie on the astroturf. Because, uh, I mean, God forbid you were ever an embarrassment to Master Bob, right?
8162	J.D.	You know, I don't care what you think.
8163	Dr. Cox	Yeah, you do.
8164	J.D.	I know.

8230	Janitor	Yes, that's it. I'm a janitor, so I couldn't think of the word "sad." I was gonna say, It makes me feel so "mop."
8231	J.D.	Let me explain, I
8232	Janitor	Go ahead, I'm "mopping."
8233	J.D.	Maybe I shouldn't bother.
8234	Janitor	Maybe you "mopn't."
8235	J.D.'s Narration	I guess after a while, you just stop being surprised by people.
8236	Mr. Hogan	Yeah...I-I-I'm going to be needing a room.
8237	Mr. Hogan	Well, who can say no to 49-cent cheeseburgers?
8238	Carla	Sure, but tack on the cost of medicine, your room, and pumping your stomach, and that 49-cent cheeseburger is gonna run you in the neighborhood of thirteen hundred dollars.
8239	Mr. Hogan	Heh. See, that's how they get you.
8240	Carla	That's right.
8241	Nurse Roberts	Carla, your brother called.
8242	Carla	Oh, cool.
8243	J.D.	I didn't know you had a brother.
8244	Carla	That's my pet-name for Turk you know, 'cause he's mine and he's a black man: "My bruthah."
8245	J.D.	That is adorable. Do you think he'd mind if I call him that, too?
8246	Carla	J.D., I was kidding.
8247	J.D.	I know. I'm still gonna ask. So, how come I don't know anything about your family?
8248	Carla	I don't know. I g I'm just not big on sharing my personal life with people.
8249	J.D.	But you know everything about me. You even know I have them switch Lauren's shifts so we always end up working together.

8254	J.D.	Wow.

8261	Carla	Can we please talk about something other than Bonnie?
8262	Elliot	I think you should give Bonnie a break. You know, it's really hard being a woman around here...you can walk through walls and nobody notices you.
8263	J.D.	Not entirely unlike a...ninja!
8264	Turk	Whatever. I'm out.
8265	J.D.	Catch you later, my bruthah!

8272	Dr. Cox	It...was...rhetorical. If you if you'd tell Mrs. Tillman that I'll be right out, that would be just...terrific.
8273	Elliot	Dr. Cox! Um, Mr. Tillman is my patient, too, you know.
8274	Dr. Cox	He is?
8275	Elliot	Yeah, I was in the room with you this morning, remember?
8276	Dr. Cox	Uhhh, no.
8277	Elliot	Well, I was. Anyway, um, I if you want, I could talk to his wife, because I...just really enjoy that kind of stuff.
8278	Dr. Cox	Wait a minute: Are you actually saying you enjoy telling people their spouses are going to die?
8279	Elliot	....Yep! I mean, I know that that sounds a little bit weird, but I-I-I-I just really like being there for people; it's...kind of why I became a doctor in the first place.

8284	Carla	Dr. Kelso, if you're here to do one of your "How are my girls today, now let me tell you some things you don't want to hear" routines, I should warn you: I'm in a mood. So it's probably in your best interest to make up some lame excuse, turn around, and leave.
8285	Dr. Kelso	Young lady, I will not be spoken to like that! Luckily, for you, I have to go see Mrs. Pfitztuffulla down in Pfofferoptrics.
8286	Carla	Atta boy.
8287	J.D.	Rough day, huh? Well, maybe it would help to share...with someone?
8288	Carla	Okay. You want in? You want me to open up?

8293	Carla	Plus, when I work up this morning, I cried for like half an hour because I thought I was getting wrinkles, but it turns out I just fell asleep on Turk's corduroy pants!
8294	J.D.	Wow.
8295	Carla	There. Now you think I'm the craziest woman here.

8301	Bonnie	Okay. How _does_ that feel?
8302	Turk	Damn!
8303	Dr. Kelso	Doctors! Something I've taken great pride in over the years is Sacred Heart's involvement in the esteemed "Doctors Without Borders" program. Now, every year, I single out the most qualified surgical resident to accompany me to Mexico for a weekend. Anyway, I've made my decision....
8304	Todd	Thank you, sir. You haven't lived until you've tasted El Todd's guac.
8305	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Turk, pack your bag.

8311	Carla	You see, that's what's really bothering me.
8312	J.D.	What, Turk and Bonnie? They hate each other.
8313	Carla	Then why is he doing his "You're so getting a piece of this" dance?
8314	J.D.	He's not! That's his "In your face" dance.... Or it's his "There's a sale on lotion" dance. I dunno; he's got so many dances.
8315	Carla	Please, they might as well be naked. Slut.
8316	J.D.	Carla! Trust me, there's no way that he's cheating on you.
8317	Carla	Yeah, you're probably right.

8391	Turk	Dr. Kelso, don't you think that's a little sexist?
8392	Dr. Kelso	I don't know, sport? Is it sexist to hold the door for a woman? Is it sexist to keep the pretty nurses and unload a few uggos? The rules have changed so much, I just can't keep up.

8463	Elliot	Um, what...room is she in?
8464	Dr. Cox	There is no room. In fact, in the history of medicine, there's never actually been a patient that depressing. I made it up! Come on, now, Barbie; you keep going down this road, you're gonna go up to the roof of this hospital and jump the hell off. Mind you, it's only five stories high, so that means you'll just wind up back down here, where I, of course, will be the one who has to treat you, and then I'll be forced to jump off the roof of this hospital, which, as I was suggesting to you, is only five stories high, and are you starting to see a pattern forming here?
8465	Elliot	I just wanted to be colleagues.
8466	Dr. Cox	Barbie, as long as you stay and work at this hospital, I'm always gonna be your superior.... That's just the way it goes.

8544	J.D.'s Thoughts	I don't know why he's an opera singer.
8545	Dr. Cox	Listen closely, Tiny Dancer: I wouldn't be flapping my mouth if I'd forgotten to get a blood culture on Mr. Blair. And, for the love of God, do you at least remember what you were doing the day they were passing out common sense? Oh, gosh, maybe you were running late that day 'cause you just couldn't find the right thong for those low-rider jeans that you love so much, or maybe you were busy bopping along to whatever boy band really makes your heart race nowadays, and you just drove on by. 'Course, I don't know, I'm just guessing, but one things' sure-shootin': you wound up at the dumb-dumb store and you just went ahead and put so much of that into the car that you could fit, didn't ya?
8546	J.D.'s Narration	And then, I did something I've never done before....
8547	J.D.	Look, Doctor: If you flip the page on that chart, you'd see that I pan-cultured him yesterday; but that would probably get in the way of the perverse pleasure you take in pointing out other peoples' slip-ups. Well, too bad, Buster Brown! Because I'm a resident now, and I'm not gonna be making the same little silly intern mistakes I made last year. I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't stand here and yell at me in front of my patient.
8548	Dr. Cox	"Buster Brown."
8549	J.D.	"Buster Brown."

8555	Carla	You go ahead and take your time.
8556	Dr. Amato	Hey, there, big fella. Just checked the board we're together on a thyroidectomy
8557	Turk	Oh, that's great, Dr. Amato.
8558	J.D.	Domo arigato, Dr. Amato.
8559	J.D.	How is that not funny?
8560	Turk	I don't know, dude.
8561	J.D.	You know, you guys are getting to be like Starsky and Hutch.
8562	Turk	That'd be true if Starsky was a ventriloquist and Hutch was a tiny puppet.
8563	J.D.	I would watch that show.
8564	Turk	Yeah.
8565	J.D.	Why do you keep ending up with that guy?
8566	Turk	Because the other surgeons are busting my chops for skipping guys' night out.
8567	J.D.	Oh, what, ending up with Dr. Amato is like a punishment or something?
8568	Turk	No, dude; I actually enjoy needing you to lower me on the toilet in the morning.
8569	J.D.	Check that out.

8578	Elliot	What guy? I was I wa I was I wasn't
8579	Carla	Elliot. I have other patients, Mrs. Bumbry needs a nap, we're all very busy....
8580	Elliot	I have never done anything like this; I just met him and slept with him! POW!
8581	Mrs. Bumbry	God, I miss one-night stands.
8582	Elliot	The best thing was, since I knew it was just a fling, I wasn't afraid to ask him for exactly what I wanted.
8583	Carla	Which was?
8584	Elliot	Shirt on, lights off, no talking.
8585	Carla	Well, you just be careful you wouldn't believe how quickly a reputation can be made in this hospital.

8591	Mr. Blair	Does that happen a lot around here?
8592	Nurse Roberts	Not enough.
8593	J.D.	Mr. Blair, that infection keeps hanging around so I wanna put you on a broader spectrum antibiotic that we'll administer intravenously.
8594	Mr. Blair	But I'm feeling a lot better.
8595	J.D.	I'm gonna tell you something my mom used to tell me whenever I was scared: In the case of severe sinus infection not responding to a three-day cycle of antibiotics, the recommended protocol is Imipenem, 500 milligrams, I.V.q. six hours. Got me through a lot of hard times.
8596	J.D.'s Narration	I love it that Mr. Blair trusted me. It's one of the best feelings you can have as a doctor.
8597	Janitor	How's it goin'?
8598	J.D.	You can't wear that!
8599	Janitor	What, you mean after Labor Day? Eh.
8600	J.D.	You know what I mean!
8601	Janitor	It's a white coat. Anybody can wear a white coat.

8605	Dr. Cox	So, Mrs. Bumbry, here, has inflammatory bowel disease, huh?
8606	Carla	Yeah; and the new drug they're testing at the clinical trial could really help her out but, of course, she doesn't qualify.
8607	Dr. Cox	Right.
8608	Carla	You okay, Mrs. Bumbry?
8609	Mrs. Bumbry	I liked Bow Wow when he was Lil' Bow Wow.
8610	Dr. Cox	Oh, she's right rappers, they grow up so fast.
8611	Dr. Cox	Look, Carla, if you're gonna survive in medicine, you've got to accept the fact that rules are rules. Hey! Anyone from that clinical trial around? Hello? Hello?
8612	Dr. Cox	Yeah, this lady's supposed to be in this trial.
8613	Orderly	Okay.
8614	Carla	What the hell did you just do?

8618	Turk	Does it have a real gun or a puppet gun?
8619	J.D.	Puppet gun. They'd sew it to its hand.
8620	Turk	Okay, I'd watch that.
8621	Turk	What's up, fellas!
8622	J.D.'s Narration	I don't care what hospital you go to, Surgery is still a boys' club.
8623	J.D.'s Thoughts	I'm just as cool as those guys.
8624	J.D.	Bye, Turk!!!

8626	Turk	You guys, Elliot's a friend of mine, so I really don't want to talk about that, okay?
8627	Dr. DiStefano	So, Dr. Turk, how is your back?

8630	J.D.	I was paged?

8632	J.D.	Anosmia? You know, I always thought it was very funny that losing your sense of smell was called "anosmia." "A-_nos_-mia", you know, like "_schnoz_mia." Don't you find that very funny?
8633	J.D.	He doesn't.
8634	Nurse Roberts	I'm calling Dr. Cox.
8635	J.D.	Whoa; nobody needs to go call Dr. Cox.
8636	Mr. Blair	This is only temporary, right?
8637	J.D.	'Course it's temporary. It could also be slightly more un-temporary.
8638	Mr. Blair	You mean "permanent."
8639	J.D.'s Narration	Just when you think you have this place figured out, it finds a new way to get you.
8640	Dr. Cox	I'm waiting.
8641	Lawyer	Unfortunately, you've, uh, put us in somewhat of a legal bind.
8642	Dr. Kelso	Way to go, Ted. My God, man, you couldn't scare a child.
8643	Lawyer	Who who would want to?
8644	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Cox, do you have any idea how much money this hospital makes from that G.I. trial into which you took the liberty of enrolling your patient?
8645	Dr. Cox	I'm gonna go ahead and guess: Seven dollars.
8646	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes it comes right at you.
8647	Dr. Kelso	Keep smiling, tough guy. First I'm going to report you to the Ethics
8648	Dr. Cox	Better finish that thought there, Bobcat, 'cause I'm not breaking my gait.
8649	Dr. Kelso	What are you looking at?
8650	Lawyer	Nothing.
8651	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes it sneaks up on you.
8652	Turk	Plus, when she dated J.D., she would just wear a t-shirt in the morning; so when she reached up high to grab a box of cereal, everybody in the room got two scoops of booty-flakes; and the two scoops they were packed with flavor. You know what I'm sayin'! Right? Right? Right!
8653	Mr. Blair	I told you I didn't want these antibiotics. Tell you what: When your first grand-kid is born, you pick him up and you smell his head, why don't you give me a call and tell me how great it is?
8654	J.D.	Mr. Blair, I'm really sorry this happened.
8655	J.D.'s Narration	And sometimes, it hits you in places you didn't even know you were vulnerable.
8656	Mr. Blair	Yeah, well you should be. It's your fault.

8665	J.D.	No, I-I just gave him I.V. Imipenem.
8666	Lawyer	Kelso's gonna blame me. Just...get rid of the nose!
8667	J.D.	Ted, I don't I don't have the nose. Maybe you should just calm down.

8742	J.D.	You were wrong and I was right.
8743	Dr. Cox	I beg your pardon?
8744	J.D.	Anosmia isn't a side-effect of I.V. Imipenem. Plus, Mr. Blair had multiple nasal polypectomies, and septoplasty; and his loss of smell is most likely caused by repeated manipulation of the sinuses along with concurrent infection. So, I didn't make a mistake; and you were wrong when you said, "Nice goin', Newbie."
8745	Dr. Cox	Here you've put me in a tough situation: I can't honestly decide whether to say, "Duh," uh, "Doy," or a very sarcastic, "Oh, really?" My God, Fiona, I know it wasn't your fault; hell, the patient probably knows! But he seemed a little distraught, like maybe being able to blame somebody for a second or two just might make him feel a little better? And, I know, maybe it's me, but doesn't that seem like something that goes right along with wearing that fancy white coat? It...does, doesn't it.
8746	J.D.	kinda.
8747	Dr. Cox	Gosh, I'm so proud of ya. Put her there.

8759	Carla	You're okay.
8760	Dr. Kelso	I'm sorry.

8837	J.D.	What?
8838	Dan	I can totally be a doctor.
8839	J.D.	I can't let you tell him!
8840	Dan	I won't call you Bambi anymore.
8841	Dan	Touch-and-go there for a while. You're a fighter! You pulled through. We're gonna get you out of here today, but! I'd like you to keep an eye on those......rickles.
8842	Patient	Rickles is my last name.
8843	Dan	You bet it is. Do you have kids?
8844	Patient	Yeah, two.
8845	Dan	That's what I'm saying. Let's keep an eye on the little Rickles children are our future!
8846	J.D.	Doctor, it's an emergency, we need you right away.
8847	Dan	Dammit, Bambi, I'm busy! So hard to find a good male nurse these days. Am I right?
8848	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8849	J.D.	You need to understand, Elliot, Dan wasn't just the captain of every team he was like the mayor of our high school. The jocks dug him, the burn-outs dug him, the nerds, like, worshipped him!
8850	Elliot	What about you?
8851	Dan	He mentioned the nerds.
8852	J.D.	See, why hurt me?
8853	Elliot	Yeah, I thought I was gonna be cool in high school for like five minutes, but then my dad made me play the tuba in the marching band and I developed massive forearms. Halfway through the prom, my silk gloves exploded off me like I was the Incredible Hulk.
8854	Dan	You know I think it's sexy to dance with a woman who can lift her partner over her head.
8855	J.D.'s Thoughts	You know, it's nice when your friends and family click. It makes you feel like
8856	J.D.'s Thoughts	Wait a second, is she still laughing?
8857	***Fantasy Sequence	Swanky sax music plays.
8858	Dan	That is
8859	J.D.	Stop your stupid laughing! It makes you look like a whore!
8860	J.D.	Jokin'! Heh.
8861	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8862	Lady	I appreciate everything you did for my husband. The funeral's tomorrow, and I'd love it if you could attend.
8863	Turk	Unfortunately I'm in surgery all day. But, still, I'm sorry for your loss.
8864	Dr. Cox	Dodging the funeral? Nice!
8865	Turk	'Scuse me?
8866	Dr. Cox	Just a veteran move from the baby-faced sophomore. The whole "I'm sorry for your loss" thing was a little Hallmark-y for me, but darn it all if you're not showing just a ton of promise!
8867	Turk	If I could be there, I'd be there. Wait a second, you treated him, right? So you should want to go, too. Right?
8868	Dr. Cox	Hey, Ghandi. For your information, I attended that poor vegetable's funeral every single time I set foot in his room over the last six weeks. Thank God the family finally moved him over to Surgery, where you guys were good enough to help him kick that nasty oxygen habit he had once and for all.
8869	Turk	Oh, that's great make jokes. You know, I wish I could be an insensitive, cynical robo-doc like you, but unfortunately, I don't hate the world enough. You know what I'm saying, chief?
8870	Dr. Cox	Will people please stop calling me "chief"!
8871	Dr. Kelso	Hey, numb-nuts.
8872	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8873	J.D.	Hey, Dan! You remember when we were kids, and every Halloween you used to always try and scare the crap out of me?
8874	Dan	Yeah, I remember that.
8875	Dan	So, while I'm here, we should play some frisbee golf, we should...maybe give dad a call.... Dad. Oh, we should definitely make sure I sleep with that Elliot chick.
8876	J.D.	That's a little weird for me 'cause...I don't know if you'd know this or not, but...we used to be intimate.
8877	Dan	Int inimate? What'd you do, bathe her?
8878	J.D.	Yeah, once...but she was wearing a swimsuit.
8879	Dan	All right, I get it. I'll back off. It's gonna be tough, though, 'cause she sounds kinda wild.
8880	Dan	Can't teach it.
8881	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8882	Dr. Cox	Come on, let's go, you've got an opposable thumb you can use it!
8883	Dr. Cox	God, I hate Halloween!
8884	Carla	Somebody needs to adjust their attitude if they want some candy.
8885	Dr. Cox	You mean the popcorn balls and the deformed lollipos? I mean, honestly, where do you get this crap anyway?
8886	Nurse Roberts	I made it! If you want name-brand candy, my fist is packed with peanuts!
8887	Dr. Cox	Of course it is.
8888	Carla	Oh, what's the matter, did Raggedy Ann scare you?
8889	Dr. Cox	What are you, a rat?
8890	Turk	Don't listen to him, Baby.
8891	Carla	I never do.
8892	Turk	So, Dr. Cox, the intern asked for a surgical consult on Mr. Carney?
8893	Dr. Cox	Yeah.
8894	Turk	I suggest we do a fem-pop bypass.
8895	Dr. Cox	Mr. Carney's a frail old man who'd...probably snap in half from a light sponge bath.
8896	Turk	All I'm saying is if we do surgery, we could improve his quality of life.
8897	Dr. Cox	The guy's a thousand. What's he gonna, take a steamer over to Europe, open up a café, and finally meet that nine hundred-year-old girl of his dreams?
8898	Turk	I made my recommendation.
8899	Dr. Cox	You stood up for what you believe in, and I respect that.
8900	Turk	Thank you.
8901	Dr. Cox	Twenty bucks says you kill him.
8902	Turk	You're on!
8903	Dr. Cox	You got it, baby.
8904	Dr. Cox	Whoa. Can I get some, uh, sugar over here?
8905	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8906	Dr. Kelso	Finally, can anyone tell me the dermatologic condition associated with rhinophyma...Dr. Murphy?
8907	Doug	Uh, could it be...psoriasis?
8908	Dr. Kelso	And yet further proof that the clown costume is redundant.
8909	Dr. Kelso	Now if any of you other would-be revelers get the urge to dress up on this, the mother of all non-holidays, please consider me the razor blade in your caramel apple. We're professionals, dammit!
8910	Dr. Kelso	You know...it's nothing personal, son...you just make me sick.
8911	Doug	He called me son! He called me son!
8912	J.D.	Score.
8913	Doug	Boo-yeah!
8914	Elliot	So, uh, you going to lunch with your brother?
8915	J.D.	Yeah, I...well, you know, I would've invited you, but I already made the reservation for two.
8916	Elliot	So call and change it to three.
8917	J.D.	Ohh, I'm not gonna mess with that hostess. You know, she uses sharp tones.
8918	Elliot	Heh, yeah right. Now, I'll give you three seconds to give me the real reason I can't go to lunch, otherwise I'm coming.
8919	Elliot	Three...two...one.
8920	J.D.	Because I need special time with my brother! Argh!
8921	Janitor	Trick.
8922	J.D.	Excuse me?
8923	Janitor	I just figure you gotta be wondering, "Am I gonna get a trick, or am I gonna get a treat?" You'll be getting a trick.
8924	J.D.	Whatever.
8925	Janitor	It'll be fast, and you won't even know it's me.
8926	J.D.	You just told me it was gonna be you.
8927	Janitor	You'll still have your doubts.
8928	Janitor	And the best part is, you're gonna be nervous all day about it, 'cause it could happen at any time!
8929	Janitor	That wasn't it. Fun, though!
8930	J.D.	False alarm, boys.
8931	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8932	Turk	All right, here we go, Mr. Carney.
8933	Turk	Dr. Wen, I want you to stay focused, okay? I want Dr. Wen to be Dr. _Zen_, man!
8934	Dr. Wen	Christopher, after fifteen years and over ten thousand surgeries, I think I can do without the pep-talk.
8935	Turk	Message received, sir. I believe in you.
8936	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8937	J.D.'s Thoughts	So, big deal, we're having lunch together. It doesn't have to be awkward.
8938	Dan	So, what's my little bro like in the sack?
8939	Elliot	What?!
8940	J.D.	You do not have to answer that.
8941	Dan	'Kay, if he tries hard but there's room for improvement, take a sip of your drink.
8942	J.D.	Hey!
8943	Elliot	What? I was thirsty.
8944	J.D.	All right, you know, fine. A-ask me if she could be better!
8945	J.D.	What? Thirsty!
8946	Elliot	I wasn't thirsty.
8947	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8948	Turk	Stable. Condition. What time is it? Time to dance!
8949	Turk	Come on! Wit' it! Come on! Bring it back! Come on! Heeeheee! Woo! Pay the man!
8950	Dr. Cox	There you go.
8951	Turk	Hello, Mr. Jackson! I want to introduce you to the Washington brothers. Y'all get nice and cozy...up in my wallet!
8952	Dr. Cox	Now, before you get too awful high up on your horse, there, Tonto, I feel it's my duty to remind you of just a little something.
8953	Turk	Mm? Hm?
8954	Dr. Cox	See, you just made a twenty dollar bet on whether a fellow human being would live or die. Now tell me, just exactly how does that make you feel, Mr. Sensitive? Pretty good?
8955	Dr. Cox	All the best.
8956	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8957	Elliot	So, uh, why'd you drive someone else's car across country?
8958	Dan	It is a great way to make three hundred bucks.
8959	Elliot	What do you do that you could take that kind of time off?
8960	Dan	I tend bar.
8961	J.D.	But not just like any bar it's like "_The_ Bar". It's like, when all the college kids come home from Thanksgiving, it's like where everybody goes. I go there when I'm home.
8962	Elliot	So you still live in your home town?
8963	Dan	Yeah, I kinda take care of my mom's place, so she lets me stay with her.
8964	J.D.	Well, Dan, you don't _stay with her_. I mean, come on, it it it he's not like Greg Brady living in the attic with beads for a door. I mean...he totally has his own space. More like...uh, Kirk Cameron in the last season of 'Growing Pains', when he lived above the garage with Boner? Anyone? Am I the only one? Boner? ...No?
8965	J.D.'s Narration	And that's when I realized that even though I was a little jealous, that's not why I was trying to keep Elliot and Dan apart.
8966	J.D.	Dan's doing great.
8967	J.D.'s Narration	...The real reason was that I was ashamed of my brother. And I think he knew it, too.
8968	Dan	You two should probably get back to work.
8969	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
8970	Elliot	These heated seats are amazing. They make my butt tingle.
8971	Dan	And every time you say that, an angel gets their wings.
8972	Dan	No, it's a sweet ride, but as J.D. has made so abundantly clear, I I could never afford this car.
8973	J.D.	Would you please just let it go!?
8974	Elliot	Um...so I'll...I'll see ya.
8975	Dan	Not if I see you first.
8976	J.D.'s Narration	Somehow I knew my brother would handle this the way he always did when there was a deep emotional conflict between us.
8977	Dan	So, can you work the windows from back there?
8978	J.D.	No...why?
8979	J.D.	Oh, God! Oh, please tell me that......that was the horn!
8980	Dan	There's your heated seat, my friend.
8981	J.D.	Oh, God! It's everywhere!

8983	Dr. Kelso	Do you people have any idea how long I've been waiting on you? Next time, if you're not here in thirty minutes or less, I expect a free dead body! ...Or at least some garlic knots.
8984	Turk	Dr. Kelso, I think that's extremely insensitive.
8985	Dr. Kelso	I don't think so. Miss Parker, you care to weigh in?
8986	Dr. Kelso	Nope, she's fine with it. And she knows a thing or two! ...Except of course that a yellow light means to slow down.
8987	Turk	You're not understanding what I'm trying to tell you.
8988	Turk	Kitty, this sucks.
8989	Carla	How can I make it better?
8990	Lady	Thank you so much for coming.
8991	Turk	Oh, are you kidding? We've been looking forward to this.... You know, ever since he...he died.

8993	Elliot	Hey, you okay?
8994	J.D.	Yeah...why wouldn't I be?
8995	Elliot	You and your brother? I mean, come on, the tension on the ride back to work was palpable. I wanted to say something. I mean, I was this close to getting back in the car.
8996	J.D.	That wouldn't have been a wise choice! No, seriously, thank you, Elliot; we're fine.
8997	J.D.	Damn you, you dirty ape!

9002	Lady	Mother, this is Dr. Turk, the surgeon who worked so hard.
9003	Turk	Oh, please, it's the least I could do for...uh....
9004	Mother	You see, he doesn't even remember his name!
9005	Turk	No! No, no, no, I remember his name.... His his name was...
9006	Turk	His name was...was...was...uh.... You know, we used to call him "old chicken neck".
9007	Lady	This is the problem with doctors today they don't care!
9008	Turk	No, no! It's just that, uh, recently I've had a lot of patients, and so it I've gotten I've been really busy!
9009	Lady	Not too busy to come here in the middle of the day and stuff your face with free food!
9010	Turk	Damn you, woman!
9011	Carla	Ladies, please! This is a good, caring doctor. He did everything he could for Bob.
9012	Lady	Right!
9013	Mother	Hah!
9014	Turk	This is "Bob"? That's "Bob"?!

9017	J.D.	Oh, I get it. Well, let's see how tough you are without your costume on. Go ahead and and knock the folders out of my hand now!
9018	Janitor	What costume?
9019	J.D.	You weren't wearing a gorilla suit before?
9020	Janitor	There's someone running around in a gorilla suit? What's he look like?
9021	J.D.	A gorilla....
9022	Janitor	No, it's not me.
9023	J.D.	Well, then, why'd you knock the folder out of my hand?!
9024	Janitor	Because you asked me to. Here you go.
9025	J.D.	I didn't ask you to do that!
9026	Janitor	Yeah...that comes free with the folder knock.
9027	Dr. Kelso	Hey, sport, how you doin'?
9028	J.D.	Oh, good, sir.
9029	Dr. Kelso	I don't have time to stand here and flirt, son. There have been rumblings that you let your brother play doctor the other day.
9030	J.D.	Dr. Kelso, I
9031	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Dorian, if I had one shred of evidence that incident actually took place, you would be working with my nephew Francis so fast, it'd make your head spin!
9032	J.D.	Sir, I don't follow.
9033	Dr. Kelso	He cleans pools! I forgot you didn't know that! Well, anyway, I trust we will not be seeing your brother in the hospital again!

9036	Turk	Oh, my God...I'm totally going to hell.
9037	Carla	Turk, wait! People get thrown out of funerals every day!
9038	Carla	Why are you laughing?
9039	Dr. Cox	Well, top of my head, I'd have to say it's because he's suffering. But, of course, I love the poetry of someone putting himself way up on a pedestal and then getting knocked the hell back down into this puddle of self-hated...with the rest of us.
9040	Carla	Did you do this to him?
9041	Dr. Cox	I don't know. Did anybody ever really _do_ anything to anybody else?
9042	Carla	You're gonna tell me why you did this and it better be good.
9043	Dr. Cox	How does "for poops and giggles" grab ya?
9044	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9045	Elliot	Isn't there...something you guys wanna talk about? You know, like cars or sports...or boobs?
9046	Dan	I'll talk about boobs. Remember Fred Kiefer's mom?
9047	J.D.	She wore a tank-top to Fred's thirteenth birthday party.... She taught us how to bob for apples, and three guys passed out.
9048	Elliot	Okay, great story! Now how about something with a little more substance?
9049	Dan	Dude, remember the cans on Pat Clark's mom?
9050	J.D.	Yeah! Those were awesome!
9051	Elliot	'Kay, you know what, forget it.
9052	J.D.	Elliot! Come on! What does she expect us to talk about?
9053	Dan	I don't know.... Maybe the fact that you're so embarrassed by me that you make excuses to your friends about how I live my life.
9054	J.D.	Oh, yeah....

9060	Dr. Cox	Let me guess, you're off to another funeral. I'll make you a deal you come with me right now, and if you're still late for the graveyard, I will personally scour the obituaries with you this weekend and you can just go nuts!
9061	Turk	Carla put you up to this?
9062	Dr. Cox	No, it was my idea. I desperately want to be close with you, I just can't figure out how to connect. Turn around.
9063	Dr. Cox	Turn around.
9064	Dr. Cox	You see Dr. Wen in there? He's explaining to that family that something went wrong and that the patient died. He's gonna tell them what happened, he's gonna say he's sorry, and then he's going back to work. You think anybody else in that room is going back to work today?
9065	Dr. Cox	Oh, and by the way.... "Bob"? Who doesn't get that?
9066	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9067	Dan	Look, J.D., we're all proud you became a doctor, but just because I haven't achieved as much as you doesn't mean I don't like what I do.
9068	J.D.	Dan, there's nothing wrong with being a bartender.
9069	Dan	I like living with mom.
9070	J.D.	She makes great eggs!
9071	Dan	All in all, I'm pretty damn happy! I'm happy...you know?
9072	J.D.'s Thoughts	And now for the apology.
9073	J.D.	That's a load of crap.
9074	J.D.	Look, I know you, okay. I know the reason you wanted to pretend you're a doctor yesterday is 'cause you hate working in that bar and you wanted to feel like somebody for once. Come on, man, you're not you're not driving that car across the country for the three hundred dollars you're doing it 'cause you like the way you feel when you drive it. And the funny thing is, you could be that guy, but you're afraid that if if you actually have to try at something you might fail, and that's just not a chance you're willing to take.
9075	Dan	What can I say? It's been a real pleasure seeing you.
9076	J.D.	Dan....
9077	J.D.'s Narration	Right then, I knew I'd never see my brother the same way again.
9078	J.D.'s Narration	You can never let go of the kid inside of you.
9079	Turk	Dude, that girl in the wolf outfit is totally checking you out!
9080	J.D.	I'd let her to blow my house down, you know what I'm sayin'!

9087	J.D.'s Narration	...Even their own home video.
9088	J.D.	See, right about here is where you get hurt.
9089	J.D.	Aw-ha-ha!

So whatta you say you make sure and take a lot of pictures, that way, when you get back, we can both sit down and put together a "Friends Forever" collage. Come on, now, the kid's sixteen years old he's a little busted up, it's not that big a deal. I mean, hell, when...when you were a kid, you must've cut your hand on your doll house?

9137	Dr. Cox	Oh, for you, Barbie: anything!
9138	Elliot	Super!
9139	Dr. Cox	But first, an interesting side note: I actually had my physical last week, and while my cholesterol was low, my blood pressure was through the roof. Needless to say, my physician was stumped; but now thank God! you've helped us solve that riddle. You see, because, the very instant I heard your shrill voice whining about a teeny-weeny problem, aw, it took every ounce of self-restraint I had to keep blood from shooting out my ears.
9140	Elliot	Doesn't it seem like, in the time it took to say all that, you could've just helped me out instead?
9141	Dr. Cox	Well, yes it does. But, here, that's what makes it delicious.
9142	J.D.	What? I am not gonna say a word.
9143	Elliot	You just did.
9144	J.D.	Except that. And...that. And now that. And that and that and that. It just keeps on going!

9146	Turk	Hey, cutie! What's your name?
9147	Carla	I'm Carla, I'm your girlfriend, and as much as I usually love it, I really don't have time to play that game where we pretend we never met, okay?
9148	Turk	Carla's a pretty name.
9149	Carla	You know I'd play, Sweetie; you know I'd play. But, because I'm "just a nurse", I have to go get Dr. Wilder's permission to give his patient some food even though I know it's perfectly fine.
9150	Todd	Speaking of things that are perfectly fine....
9151	Carla	Eugh.
9152	Todd	That was a compliment! Why won't any women talk to me?
9153	Nurse	Because you're slimy. And you turn everything into a double entendre.
9154	Todd	Not true!
9155	Turk	Go ahead.
9156	Todd	I'd like to double her entendre!
9157	Todd	Please?

9159	J.D.'s Thoughts	He's leaving! This is officially the greatest day ever!
9160	J.D.	Taking off?
9161	Janitor	Yeah. If that's okay?
9162	J.D.	That's fine.
9163	Janitor	You know, I just wanted to, uh, sneak out for an hour, and see my kid's fourth grade play. But, you caught me!
9164	J.D.	No. N-n-no no catchies.
9165	Janitor	No, no, no; I think you're right. From now on, before I do anything, I'll make sure to run it by you first. Permission to go see my kid's attempt to overcome his crippling shyness by appearing in his fourth grade class's production of "Town Without A Turkey"?
9166	J.D.	I gotta get back to work.
9167	Janitor	"Back to work..." Message received.
9168	J.D.'s Thoughts	What just happened!?!
9169	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9170	Elliot	I can't figure out what to do about Mrs. Kahn. I don't know if I should send her to surgery?
9171	J.D.	Well, don't send her to surgery. I'll tell you what you do: You wait and see. And I know I'm right, 'cause I'm a "wait and see" kind of guy. You know, Elliot, in modern medicine, we're faced with tough decisions almost every day
9172	Elliot	You are amazing!
9173	J.D.	Well, amazing is sort of a strong word.... I just show up and let the Lord work through me.
9174	Elliot	You actually think you're a better doctor than me, don't you?
9175	J.D.'s Thoughts	Well, I do have better bed-side manner.... I anticipate problems way ahead of time.... Oh, and my hair never gets in my face; so yes, yes I do!
9176	J.D.	No I don't.
9177	Elliot	Yes you do. Every time you stare off in to space like this....
9178	Elliot	...I know you're just thinking of something you're too afraid to say.
9179	J.D.	Please, I never do this....
9180	J.D.'s Thoughts	Maybe she's just upset because she knows I'm right?
9181	Elliot	Oh, my God!
9182	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9183	J.D.	Dr. Cox, I hate to bring it up again, but it seems important.... Julie likes our tushies.
9184	Dr. Cox	Newbie, any doctor with even a shred of self-respect wouldn't give that woman the time of day.
9185	Dr. Kelso	Oh, Julie!
9186	Dr. Cox	Well, well. If it isn't the Captain and Tennille of the underworld.
9187	Julie	Hi, boys!
9188	J.D.	Hi, Julie!
9189	Dr. Kelso	Perry, do you know the name of the new anti-arrhythmic drug that Julie is selling?
9190	Dr. Cox	That's a tough one.
9191	J.D.	It's Plomox.
9192	Dr. Cox	Nice work, Nancy Drew. Now, see if you can solve the one about the missing ID badge.
9193	Julie	Plomox is the most effective anti-arrhythmic drug on the market right now. And it has minimal side-effects: Only nausea, impotence, and anal leakage.
9194	Dr. Cox	I'm getting two out of three just from the conversation.
9195	Dr. Kelso	You kids can talk more about it tonight over the pharmaceutical dinner that you're going to help her put together.
9196	Dr. Cox	Don't do this to me, Bob!
9197	Julie	Do it to him, Bob!
9198	Dr. Kelso	And Perry, we're going to need a big staff turn-out, so don't take "no" for an answer!
9199	Dr. Cox	You going, there, Chief?
9200	Dr. Kelso	No! If I wanted to make boring small talk over low-grade beef, I'd have dinner at home.
9201	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9202	Carla	I'm just increasing your Lidocaine drip just a little bit, okay, Mr. Brooks?
9203	Turk	Hey, uh, Carla? You got a second?
9204	Carla	No, actually I'm swamped.
9205	Turk	I got a present for you...!
9206	Carla	Why would you get me a present?
9207	Turk	Why does it need to be a birthday or an anniversary for me to get my baby a little somesing-somesing.
9208	Carla	Ahhh. Plus, you figure you'd get yourself a little at work "somesing-somesing."
9209	Turk	I'll get the door!
9210	Carla	Wow! A bus pass! Help me get off my bra.
9211	Turk	That's not all! You'll use that bus pass for an all expense paid trip to...Nurse Practitioner School! Where you'll learn how to be more than "just a nurse"!
9212	Carla	"Just" a nurse?
9213	Turk	Did I say "just a nurse"? I meant "a nurse"! Honey, you were complaining about having to ask Dr. Wilder for permission just to feed a patient. And this way, you'll have more responsibility, plus you'll make more money; so, I thought that
9214	Carla	You thought that the only reason I've been doing my job for the last eight years is because someone didn't come along to hand me a brochure?
9215	Turk	And a bus pass?
9216	Carla	You're unbelievable.
9217	Turk	Damn!
9218	Todd	Dude! I am just as disappointed as you are.
9219	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9220	Elliot	J.D., look, even though I decided to send Mrs. Kahn to surgery, I know that you were just trying to help me in your own...sucky way. And...I over-reacted, and that's something I've been working on in therapy to not do as much.
9221	J.D.	But, I still think you should have gone with my "wait and see" approach.
9222	Elliot	Well, you're not the boss of me!!!
9223	J.D.	I'm not the boss of anyone around here.
9224	Janitor	Permission to use the can, Boss.
9225	J.D.	Enough, already! I'm not doing this.
9226	J.D.	Fine! Permission granted!

9228	Dr. Kelso	So, Mr. Brooks is doing peachy, huh?
9229	Carla	Peachy-keen.
9230	Dr. Kelso	Great. Great! A patient's improvement is always cause for celebration here at Sacred Heart. And yet, for some reason, I'm not wearing a party hat, sitting bare-ass on the hospital's copier machine.
9231	Dr. Kelso	You know why? It's not because I have the name Johnny tattooed on my butt he's an old sailor buddy, and if you went through what we did, you'd understand. It's because somebody went ahead and increased Mr. Brooks' Lidocaine drip, and by law that could only be a doctor. Are _you_ a doctor, Nurse Espinosa?
9232	Dr. Kelso	Well?
9233	Carla	No, sir.
9234	Dr. Kelso	You're damn right, you're not.
9235	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9236	Julie	So, how's the guest list for tonight's steak dinner shaping up?
9237	Dr. Cox	Well, now, I don't have any definitive confirmations yet, but, admittedly, that could be because I haven't asked anyone.
9238	Julie	Why does it have to be like this every time I come here? I mean, what is your problem with me?
9239	Dr. Cox	Okay. Well, for starters, everyone here knows that you sell pills, and yet you use phrases like "take orally" and "increases blood flow" way, _way_ too much. I mean, jeepers, Julie, don't you understand you got half the doctors on this staff believing that if they go ahead and join team Plomox, that they got an outside shot of you showing them the cotton inside your bottle?
9240	Dr. Cox	Would you like to know the real dirty, dirty little secret?
9241	Dr. Cox	It's that your drug is so damn good that you guys went ahead and put a six-hundred percent mark-up on it. But, hey, the only ones who get hurt are the sick people, right? And since your company damn-sure doesn't care about them, and you're part of the system, that just means you don't care, either. And that's...pretty much what's making me sick; that's all.
9242	Julie	Well, you can say what you want, Perry. But we both know that you'd love nothing more than to smack this fine ass.
9243	Julie	Ooh!
9244	Dr. Cox	Oh!
9245	Julie	Perry?
9246	Julie	Harder, Perry! Ooh! Don't stop, Perry! Ow! Perry. That feels goo-ooh-ooh-ood!
9247	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9248	J.D.	All right, so you promise me you're gonna be more careful, right?
9249	Mike	Look, dude, the only way to feel alive is to push the limits once in a while. You know?
9250	J.D.	Well.... Keep it real!
9251	Mike	Oh, God.
9252	Mike	See ya, geek!
9253	J.D.	Buy a cup!
9254	J.D.	Hey. What's wrong?
9255	Elliot	Mrs. Kahn died on the operating table.
9256	J.D.'s Narration	There are a lot of things that can take you by surprise.
9257	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes, it's just realizing that you're not as happy as you thought.
9258	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes, it's a hot chick smacking her tushie.
9259	J.D.'s Narration	And sometimes, it's when you take a chance...and lose.
9260	Elliot	This just sucks.... You know?
9261	J.D.'s Thoughts	This is a crucial moment. Pick your words carefully.
9262	J.D.	I guess I was right after all.
9263	J.D.	Stupid!
9264	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9265	J.D.'s Narration	I had to talk to Elliot before she went in to the Morbidity and Mortality Conference; 'cause nothing puts you in a worse mood than having to explain why your patient died.
9266	J.D.'s Thoughts	I just need an opportunity to talk to her when there's no possible way that she can interrupt me.
9267	J.D.'s Thoughts	Peanut-butter cracker! Go, go, go!
9268	J.D.	Elliot! Hey! What I said earlier came out completely the wrong way; I just want you to know that I-I

9273	Todd	Which one of these waitresses you think will do me?
9274	Dr. Cox	I'd say you got an outside shot with the bus-boy over there.
9275	Carla	You realize this doesn't count, right?
9276	Turk	Yeah, but, Baby: Free steak!
9277	Dr. Cox	You just flat-out get women, don't you.
9278	Turk	Baby, this is kind of romantic, right?
9279	Todd	Check it out: It's a meat cookie!
9280	Carla	Ugh-guh.
9281	Julie	Hello, boys and girl! So, how's the food?
9282	Todd	Mmm.

9286	Dr. Cox	Look, I'm just here to enjoy my meal, so unless those things dispense A-1 sauce, I'd keep movin'.
9287	Julie	That is so, so funny! You know what else is funny? How you claim you want nothing to do with me, yet, every time I turn around, there you are. Hm! I wonder why that is?
9288	Julie	Ooh! That feels good!

9290	Dr. Kelso	Finally we have, um, Dr. Reid's necrotizing fasciitis case. Deceased.
9291	Dr. Kelso	Oh, don't be frightened, Sweetheart, no one's on trial, here at least not until the family sues your little behind.
9292	Dr. Kelso	Sweetie, I'm not joking. But, should that happen, you may rest assured that the hospital will stand behind you one-hundred percent.
9293	Elliot	Thank you very much, sir.
9294	Dr. Kelso	Now, see, there I _was_ joking. Try to keep up.
9295	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, God, this is painful. It's like watching a shark circle a baby harp seal.
9296	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Reid faced a very difficult decision. And she chose an extremely risky course.
9297	J.D.'s Thoughts	He's like a royal python torturing a hopper mouse. ...Man, I love Animal Planet.
9298	Kelso	I believe we all have a lesson to learn from Dr. Reid's case....
9299	J.D.'s Thoughts	And here comes the crushing blow!
9300	Dr. Kelso	...I say, kudos to Dr. Reid.
9301	J.D.	Whattos to who?
9302	Student	Shhh.
9303	Dr. Kelso	...Without surgery, her patient didn't have a popsicle's chance in hell. By making the tough choice, she at least gave Mrs. Kahn an honest shot.
9304	Dr. Kelso	And now, for all of you "wait and see" doctors out there....
9305	Fantasy Sequence	J.D. sits alone in the hall, and Dr. Kelso addresses him. Only him.
9306	Dr. Kelso	...If you do not get to the point where you have the courage to take risks, you will _never_ be a great doctor.
9307	J.D.	Never?
9308	Dr. Kelso	Never _ever_.
9309	Carla	Turk, don't eat off my plate!
9310	Turk	You're right, Baby, I'm sorry; that's rude.
9311	Carla	So, you're having steak with a side of steak?
9312	Turk	That's right turf and turf.
9313	Carla	You know what? I'm on my second glass of good wine, I'm watching my boyfriend try to eat his body-weight in meat, and I am extremely tickled that the only thing Dr. Cox wants isn't on the menu. Ha!
9314	Dr. Cox	What?
9315	Carla	Oh, what can I say? I'm finally having a good time.
9316	Dr. Cox	That'll pass.
9317	Todd	I still think it's pretty lame that you didn't like Turk's nurse practitioner present.
9318	Turk	Dude.
9319	Dr. Cox	Told ya.

9321	J.D.	Hey, Elliot, I'm...I'm sorry that I was such a jerk before. But, hey, I got mine...right? Anyway, thanks for being classier than I am and not rubbing it in my face.
9322	Elliot	No problem. Hey.... You never told me that you're part Native American.
9323	J.D.	What are you talking about?
9324	Elliot	Aren't you a member of the Waitansee tribe?
9325	Elliot	Oh, come on! I I laughed so hard when I thought of that that I peed a little!
9326	Elliot	I changed right after.
9327	Todd	Well, seriously, why wouldn't you want a better job?
9328	Turk	Hold up. My Baby's happy with being just a nurse. Did I say "Just a nurse"? I didn't mean "just a nur ". Nobody at this table said "just ". I meant: "A Nurse." Right, Baby?
9329	Carla	That's right!
9330	Todd	Why?
9331	Dr. Cox	Oh, just not smart. Even for you.
9332	Carla	Excuse _me_ for not having all your male ambition. I can't believe anyone would look down on me because I'm good at what I do, and because I love doing it!
9333	Turk	I'm sick to my stomach.
9334	Carla	Me too, Turk! Me too!
9335	Turk	No, Baby, I'm serious; I think I'm in trouble here.
9336	Carla	Baby?

9338	Janitor	Permission to speak, sir?
9339	J.D.	You know what no. No, you may not speak not now, and not ever, okay? You have overplayed your hand and you may never talk to me again. Those are the rules of the game.
9340	Janitor	Then I quit.
9341	J.D.	No, no, no, no! No quitsies! Check-mate, Gin, and Yahtzee, my friend.
9342	Janitor	You know, my son used to love to play Yahtzee with me, until you made me skip his play. Now he won't eat!

9350	Dr. Cox	...Guy pissin' on the dumpster. Oh! Did I break the mood?
9351	Julie	Fine. Want me to drop the flirty crap? I'm interested in you. I think we're a lot alike, I think we have chemistry...and I think you're scared, so you use what I do as an excuse not to give us a try.
9352	Dr. Cox	Sorry, I gotta go.
9353	Dr. Cox	You okay?
9354	Julie	Look at that I bounced back!
9355	Turk	Baby, my stomach's gonna explode!
9356	Carla	It's only heartburn, Sweetie, you'll be fine.
9357	Dr. Cox	Hey.
9358	Carla	Hey.
9359	Dr. Cox	How's, uh, how's MeatHead?
9360	Carla	I know I'm not a doctor, but if you could order a strong antiemetic, that would be great.
9361	Dr. Cox	For the record, you know you would ace that nurse practitioners program.
9362	Carla	Really? You think so? Well, what if the classes are too hard? What if the teachers are mean? What if the other kids don't like me?
9363	Dr. Cox	Okay.
9364	Carla	Of course I would ace that program! But I barely get to see my boyfriend as it is. And if I went to class five nights a week? Well.... I guess I'm taking my chances on Turk right now.
9365	Dr. Cox	Him?
9366	Turk	Somebody make it stop!
9367	Carla	I just don't want to look back and wonder what could have been, you know?

9371	Elliot	Hey. How's it going?
9372	J.D.	You have more jokes, don't you?
9373	Elliot	I jotted a couple of things down!
9374	J.D.	Mm. You see that nurse over there? I love her. Every night at 10:30 for the last year, I've watched her come in here and get a cup of coffee. And not once have I had the courage to even ask her her name.
9375	Elliot	Well, if it makes you feel any better, she has a snaggletooth.
9376	J.D.	The point is, Kelso's right; you know? It's not even just professionally in my personal life, I don't take any chances, either. I want to, I just...I can never seem to take that first step.
9377	Elliot	Come here!
9378	J.D.	What?
9379	Elliot	Come on!
9380	J.D.	Where are we going? I don't I don't want to go anywhere. I want to spend time with Snaggletooth!
9381	Elliot	Nooo.
9382	J.D.'s Narration	I guess it all comes down to what we're willing to risk.
9383	J.D.'s Narration	For some of us, it's our feelings....
9384	Julie	Wanna talk?
9385	Dr. Cox	No.
9386	J.D.'s Narration	For others, it's our future....
9387	Turk	Baby?
9388	Carla	Hm?
9389	Turk	If I had to do it again, I would. 'Cause I love steak.
9390	Carla	I know, Buppy. I know.
9391	J.D.'s Narration	For me, it was taking a risk, period. Even if that meant starting with my very first step.
9392	Mike	Dude, you're gonna love this!
9393	J.D.	I don't wanna do it.
9394	Elliot	Come on, what's the worst that could happen?

9415	Carla	Hey, there, Sunshine!
9416	J.D.	Morning.
9417	J.D.'s Narration	I forgot Carla is staying with us while her building is being fumigated.
9418	Turk	Hey! Don't use Rowdy to cover up your giblets! Apologize!
9419	Carla	Hey, can somebody tell me why we have no milk or orange juice, but, like, forty fruit cups in here?
9420	J.D.'s Narration	The average resident owes over one hundred thousand dollars in med school loans, and makes about as much as a waiter. So you have to do things to make ends meet.
9421	J.D.'s Narration	Like, you can cover someone's shift.
9422	J.D.'s Narration	....Or you can steal stuff from the hospital.
9423	J.D.'s Narration	Or you can moonlight at an urgent care center.
9424	J.D.'s Narration	....Or, you can steal stuff.

9445	Dr. Cox	Well, what can I say? You did exceptional work today, Newbie, and I'm proud of you.
9446	J.D.'s Thoughts	Did he just wink at me?
9447	Dr. Cox	There a problem?
9448	Fantasy Shot	J.D. is sobbing tears of joy.
9449	J.D.	I'm just so happy!
9450	J.D.	No, no problem, sir.
9451	Dr. Cox	Thatta boy.
9452	Dr. Cox	And, Laverne, what is that delightfully naught-aye scent you're wearing?
9453	Nurse Roberts	It's called Twelve Hour Shift.
9454	Dr. Cox	Ow. Yeah, it is.
9455	Nurse Roberts	Why the hell is he so cheery?
9456	J.D.	Because I did exceptional work today.
9457	Dr. Cox	Hey, babe.
9458	Julie	Hey. I ordered the fight on pay-per-view, got a six-pack of your favorite beer, and we are leaving this second.
9459	Dr. Cox	Hop on, blondie. Come'ere.
9460	Dr. Cox	Oh, Perry gonna get some lovin'. Perry gonna get some lovin'. Oh, Perry gonna get some lovin'.
9461	Nurse Roberts	Mm-hmm.
9462	Dr. Kelso	Is there one bathroom in this damn place that has toilet paper? Or do I have to start carrying around a basket of leaves?!
9463	Turk	This is the reason why your headache didn't go away: That's actually pronounced analgesic, not anal-gesic. Sir, the pills go in your mouth.
9464	Doctor	You know, we're gonna be short another doctor tomorrow night, so if you've got a friend that wants to pick up extra three hundred bucks....?
9465	Turk	And they said they'll pay you two hundred bucks cash money.
9466	J.D.	Sweet! Dude, you are like the best friend ever!
9467	Turk	Hell, yeah!

9469	Carla	Uuuggh! My mother lives with me all year my aunt Marie has to take care of her for _one week_ and she won't stop bitching!
9470	Elliot	So? My dad's coming in to town for a conference tomorrow.
9471	Carla	You don't seem that stressed out.
9472	Elliot	Well, I haven't pooed in six days.
9473	J.D.	Twice this morning, and I haven't even had my coffee yet.
9474	Elliot	You really pick odd things to brag about.
9475	J.D.	I'm just saying, if I had to get three by lunch, I probably could.
9476	Carla	Hey, guys. Gyno Girls, twelve o'clock.
9477	Fantasy Shot	The sultry Gyno Girl introductory music plays as a quartet of babes in white coats approach.
9478	J.D.'s Narration	Obstetrics and Gynecology is a specialty that's usually dominated by women.
9479	Dr. Gerson	Dr. Reid? I'm Dr. Gerson. We were just wondering if you have any thoughts about your specialty? Because we really think you're OB-GYN material.
9480	J.D.'s Narration	Being a Gyno Girl is a lot like being in a sorority.
9481	Fantasy Sequence	The Gyno Girls wear very little as they have a giggly pillow fight on a great big sorority room bed. They pair off and begin kissing.
9482	Elliot	J.D.! I can't go with Dr. Gerson because I have to help you...right?
9483	J.D.	Ah, just gimme a second, I'm figuring something out for a patient.
9484	Fantasy Sequence	Resumes with the girls just sitting on the bed, pulling themselves together.
9485	Dr. Gerson	I'm glad we all finally experimented with each other...but I'll never do it again.

9488	Male Doctor	Julie!
9489	Julie	Hey, Rob! Good to see you! Hey, Dan!
9490	Dr. Cox	Oh, God! I just hate that every doctor you ever gave a drug sample to sniffs around you like a pathetic little puppy-dog.
9491	Julie	I never gave those guys anything! I _slept_ with them!
9492	Dr. Cox	Oh! Great....
9493	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9494	Elliot	Those Gyno Girls are really putting the pressure on. We must have looked at a hundred women's bajingos today! Bajingo, bajingo, bajingo! I mean, I can't even look at my own bajingo, you know?
9495	Carla	Is that because it looks so much like a vagina?
9496	Elliot	Carla! There's people! You know, forget it. I'm just gonna stand up to them and tell them that I'm not interested.
9497	Carla	I think you should.
9498	Elliot	Sir? Why...are you laughing?
9499	Dr. Kelso	Oh, who knows. It could be the funny face I made with my peas....
9500	Dr. Kelso	But, gun to my head, I'd say I'm laughing at the notion that you could stand up to anybody.

9502	Turk	There we go.
9503	J.D.'s Narration	Moonlighting sucks. But Turk and I make do.
9504	Turk	Now, will a lollipop put a smile on your face?
9505	J.D.	How about if Dr. Turk sings "Jimmy Crack Corn"?
9506	J.D.	How about if Dr. Turk sings "Jimmy Crack Corn" as Neil Diamond?
9507	Turk	Okay.
9508	J.D.	Hit it.
9509	Turk	"Jimmy crack corn, and I don't care / Jimmy crack corn..." hold this for me....
9510	Turk	"...and I don't care / "Jimmy crack corn, and I don't ca re-uh!"
9511	Doctor	Dr. Dorian. We could use you again tomorrow if you'd like to make another three hundred dollars?
9512	J.D.	_Three_ hundred?
9513	J.D.'s Thoughts	Luckily for Turk, revenge is a dish best served cold.... Not unlike this tapioca pudding.
9514	Janitor	You know, we're zeroing in on the guy that's been stealing stuff.
9515	J.D.	Oh? Well, that's good.
9516	Janitor	Yep. In fact, right now, I'm dusting for fingerprints.
9517	J.D.	Really?
9518	Janitor	Nah, I'm just dusting.

9520	J.D.	Hey, Dr. Cox. I finished those discharge dictations you wanted me to do, and I was able to get Mrs. Chesky on the transplant list.
9521	J.D.'s Thoughts	And here comes the wink.
9522	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, maybe I'll start it off.
9523	Dr. Cox	Oh, my God, Sabrina. You had better tell me that you just had laser eye surgery and they accidentally severed the muscle that enables you to hold that lid up, because you did not just wink at me!
9524	J.D.	I didn't mean anything by it; I...I wink at everybody.
9525	J.D.	Oh, hey, Dr. Kelso!
9526	Dr. Kelso	Save it for the bath houses, sport.
9527	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, boy.
9528	Carla	Don't take your anger out on Bambi!
9529	Dr. Cox	I'm not angry. So, my girlfriend serviced most of the staff. I'm proud of her commitment to medicine.
9530	Carla	Please! What about all the women you've slept with? Your ex-wife, that med student, your ex-wife, the cute nurse from radiology, your ex-wife....
9531	Dr. Cox	Would you please get off my ex-wife?
9532	Carla	I will if you will.
9533	Dr. Cox	Well...dammit! Gosh, now I'm too proud of ya to be mad at you.
9534	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9535	Elliot	So, Dad, how are things at home?
9536	Dr. Reid	They're good...good. Your mom redid the bedroom again. I'm gonna keep mine the way it is.
9537	Elliot	Well, you don't want to be one of those couples that does everything together.
9538	Dr. Reid	Sorry.
9539	Dr. Reid	Hello?
9540	Elliot	I just wanted you to know, sir, that I faced up to those Gyno Girls with a very strong and clear "No thank you."
9541	Dr. Kelso	Yes. I heard about your note!
9542	Elliot	Th-th-th-the point is that I'm out.
9543	Dr. Reid	That was your mom. She said to say...something.
9544	Elliot	Oh.
9545	Dr. Reid	So, did Dr. Gerson ever contact you?
9546	Elliot	You told her to talk to me?
9547	Dr. Reid	She went to med school with a colleague at my hospital. Come on, I want to go see the department.
9548	Dr. Kelso	Paging Dr. Backbone to the Bajingo Ward!
9549	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9550	Turk	Hey, man. You wanna grab a couple of beers tonight?
9551	J.D.	Can't. I'm moonlighting at Urgent Care.
9552	Turk	That's funny, the lady didn't call me?
9553	J.D.	Well, maybe that's because I found out you stole a hundred dollars from me and I Marcia Brady'd your ass.
9554	Turk	What?
9555	J.D.	You know, when Marcia was working at the ice cream shop, and then she got Jan a job, and they liked Jan better, so they fired Marcia.
9556	Turk	Yeah, "Marcia Gets Creamed" Season Five, Episode Three. Don't _ever_ question me on The Bunch. Besides, there's no way they liked you better than me.
9557	J.D.	Then maybe it's because I told her that you smoke the ganja.
9558	Turk	What!? That that's not even true! You're a jackass!
9559	J.D.	Where're you going? Munchies?
9560	Dr. Cox	I so don't think so!
9561	Julie	Hey! I was watching that.
9562	Dr. Cox	I know, but it's my place, so it's house rules. Lookit, I-I feel like...I owe you an apology, here.
9563	Julie	Really? For what?
9564	Dr. Cox	Well, just for being so jealous and pissy lately. I mean, I guess I just kind of got hung up on the fact that you were with, you know, Dr. Jasper and...Dr. Michaels...Dr. Stone. Was it his ear hair? Is that what is so compelling about him? Nevermind. The point is that this relationship, right here, is about the present...and it's about the future; and I'm never gonna let anything from our past ever get in our way again. Deal?
9565	Julie	Deal.
9566	Dr. Cox	Come here.

9574	Julie	Who are you?
9575	Jordan	Who do you think I am?
9576	Julie	Well, you have keys to the apartment, so I'm gonna say...the maid.
9577	Jordan	Oh.
9578	Dr. Cox	Julie, this is my ex-wife, Jordan; Jordan, this is my girlfriend, Julie. Okay! That was a treat, wasn't it? Now, would you like me to call you a cab, or should I just whistle and have the flying monkeys bring the broom around?
9579	Jordan	Oh, no.... He called you his girlfriend. If I were you, I'd start gathering your tiny panties up, because...I think you're done.
9580	Julie	I'm already bored by you. Perry, I will be in the bedroom; come join me when Tubby leaves.
9581	Jordan	Ta.
9582	Dr. Cox	Oh, who did that to you?
9583	Jordan	Well, I was at this fabulous hotel in Greece chock-full of available, wealthy men scru
9584	Dr. Cox	So, it was the bellboy.
9585	Jordan	Er, busboy or poolboy...something-boy I don't know. Anyway, when I first found out, I was panicked; and then I thought, you know, I've kind of been drifting through life all these years and I need to look into my heart and see what really matters to me. Anyway, I decided to keep the stupid kid.
9586	Dr. Cox	You should cut out the middleman and just have a therapist deliver him. I mean, honestly, Jordan, why why are you telling me...this?
9587	Jordan	Oh! Because I've also decided that I want you back.
9588	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9589	Janitor	Yeah, we got him. And he's gonna pay.
9590	J.D.	They're actually arresting someone for stealing pudding and toilet paper?
9591	Janitor	No. They found twenty bottles of Vicodin in his backpack. Did you steal pudding and toilet paper?
9592	J.D.	What? No! I hate pudding, and I don't use toilet...paper.
9593	J.D.	I have one of those French things that shoots water up your butt.
9594	Janitor	"Bidet."
9595	J.D.	Bidet to you, sir.
9596	Carla	I miss you.
9597	Turk	I miss you, too.
9598	Carla	I thought I was gonna get to see you last night.
9599	Turk	Yeah, I know, but I...freakin' caught a E.M.T. shift, and I was riding around in an ambulance all night.
9600	J.D.	That is so cool! Did they let you run the siren?
9601	Turk	I'm not talking to you. ....And, yes.
9602	J.D.	Oh, quit being such a baby.
9603	Turk	"Bab " You stole my job!
9604	J.D.	You stole my money!
9605	Turk	That was a _finder's fee_!
9606	J.D.	Oh, yeah? Well find this!

9611	Dr. Reid	It's a...hell hole.
9612	Elliot	Dad? Why are you so set on me being an OB-GYN?
9613	Dr. Reid	Look, Honey, your highest income potential as a female physician is in Obstetrics.
9614	Elliot	But...don't you think that, maybe it's time that you left those sort of things up to me?
9615	Dr. Reid	Well, since I paid for your college, your medical school, your car, and now your apartment and all your living expenses, I'd have to say no.
9616	Dr. Reid	Good God, someone vomited on my hot dog.
9617	Elliot	It's chili, Dad! Okay? And you know what? Even though I really appreciate everything that you've given me, it's my life! So stop complaining and enjoy your damn meal!

9641	Dr. Cox	Oh, gimme a break, I can knock that out on the way to work. Hey, lady, I'm proud of what you're doing here.

9655	J.D.	Carla....
9656	Carla	Hold on a second.
9657	Carla	Bambi, I've got ten messages from my mother. My Aunt Marie won't stop calling me _about_ my mother. I still gotta run home and put out canned food for my cat, because apparently the dry stuff doesn't cut it anymore. Plus, Turk and I can't find five minutes to spend together, because I'm working doubles and he's moonlighting non-stop so we can scrape together enough money to send my mother to a decent retirement community. So, what, Bambi? What?!
9658	J.D.	We'll talk later.
9659	J.D.'s Narration	Carla said something that made me realize exactly what I had to do.
9660	Turk	That's it for me, man. I'ma get my stuff and get out of here.
9661	Staffer	Okay, man.
9662	Turk	What the hell are you doing in here?
9663	J.D.	She said "we."
9664	Turk	What?
9665	J.D.	Carla. She said "we" "We need to scrape some money together." And it wasn't just like a "we're dating" we; it was just like a "we're gonna spend the rest of our lives together" we. I don't know, man, that that just seems big to me, you know?
9666	Turk	Yeah, I know.
9667	J.D.	Can I run the siren?
9668	Turk	Yeah, but be quick.
9669	Carla	So, you finally stood up to your father?
9670	Elliot	Yep.
9671	Carla	And he cut you off no money, no nothing?
9672	Elliot	Pretty much.
9673	Carla	Jerk. Wow. This is a big place.
9674	Elliot	Do you know where I could find some boxes?
9675	Julie	So, is your ex-wife like all women are crazy-crazy? Or more like that assistant who tazered David Spade-crazy?
9676	Dr. Cox	Well, you gotta try and understand, she's going through a rough time right now, and I'm the one she's used to leaning on. Which, in her current condition, is actually causing me more physical pain than it is emotional. But, still, it sure was silly of her to try to make me choose between the two of you.
9677	Julie	I guess it was a pretty easy decision, huh?
9678	Dr. Cox	Well, when I really had a chance to think about it, it turns out it was the easiest decision I ever made.
9679	Dr. Cox	I was always gonna wind up with you.
9680	Jordan	So, the whole vulnerable crying thing worked, huh?
9681	Dr. Cox	I never had a chance.
9682	Jordan	You do realize I'm pregnant, don't you?
9683	Dr. Cox	Yeah. They're both for me.

9689	J.D.	Wow.
9690	Turk	Sorry I ripped you off.
9691	J.D.	Ah, forget about it. You can keep the hundred bucks.
9692	Turk	I was gonna, man. I was gonna.
9693	J.D.'s Narration	I usually don't like thinking about the future. I mean, let's face it, you can't predict what's gonna happen.
9694	J.D.'s Narration	But sometimes, the thing you didn't expect is what you really wanted after all.
9695	J.D.'s Narration	Maybe the best thing to do is just stop trying to figure out where you're going, and just enjoy where you're at.
9696	Turk	All right, now, who wants a refill?
9697	Elliot	Gu I can't afford this place!

9706	J.D.	Nada. That's fourteen times we've done it to him, and not one laugh.
9707	Turk	Mark it up.
9708	Carla	Let's get going to Elliot's.
9709	J.D.'s Narration	Elliot's dad cut her off financially. Luckily, she's got friends to rally around her.
9710	J.D.	You got any food?
9711	Carla	How're you holding up, Hon?
9712	Elliot	Okay...
9713	Turk	Yoooooo! Talk about a deluxe apartment in the sky! Elliot, it would really suck to lose this place—
9714	Turk	Then again, Elliot, this place is— Is that a jacuzzi on your deck?
9715	Elliot	Lately, I just feel like I'm drowning, you know?
9716	J.D.	This pear is delicious!
9717	J.D.	Need help packing?
9718	J.D.'s Narration	As bad as things were going for Elliot...
9719	J.D.	Oh, God, that's good.
9720	J.D.'s Narration	...they were going pretty well for me.
9721	Dr. Cox	I guarantee you, that's a simple case of cellulitis right there.
9722	J.D.	Uhhhh, actually, Dr. Cox, I was watching TV last night, and they had this special on flesh-eating bacteria....
9723	Dr. Cox	Necrotizing fasciitis; yeeeesss?
9724	J.D.	Yeah, I think they called it "flesh-eating bacteria" to sound more flashy — you know, hook in all the idiots.
9725	Dr. Cox	Apparently it worked.
9726	J.D.	Anyhoo, point being, uh, they said it was very easy to confuse, uh, cellulitis with chompers....
9727	J.D.	"Chompers" was the — the animated flesh-eating bacteria that — that narrated the special.
9728	Dr. Cox	Look, Britney, recently I made the potentially fatal mistake of getting back together with my ex-wife, who, angel that she is, is carrying the spawn of another man's seed. So forgive me if I sound a tad irritable when I tell you, I don't care what piece of irrelevant drivel you picked off TV while you were snuggled up in your Holly Hobbie P.J.s.
9729	J.D.'s Thoughts	Come on, trust yourself.
9730	J.D.	I think you're wrong.
9731	Dr. Cox	Really.
9732	Dr. Cox	Well, I think you're—
9733	Dr. Kelso	Brilliant! Necrotizing fasciitis! That's a one in a million diagnosis, son! One in a million!
9734	J.D.	Bah, it's nothing, sir. Anyone coulda made that call.
9735	Dr. Kelso	And yet, they didn't. The student becomes the teacher, eh, Perry? Haha... warms my heart.
9736	J.D.	Thank you, sir.
9737	Dr. Kelso	I don't care about you, son; I'm trying to do something here!
9738	Dr. Kelso	Rats! He broke my rhythm.
9739	Dr. Cox	So, I'm guessin' this is just about the greatest moment of your life, huh, there, Newbie?
9740	***Flashback	The Bar
9741	J.D.'s Thoughts	Holy crap, it's David Copperfield!
9742	J.D.	Well, definitely top two.

9759	J.D.	Grr!
9760	Nurse	Doctor. Could you sign these, please?
9761	J.D.	Ah! Sure. "To my two biggest fans."
9762	Nurse	Yeah. They're called breasts.
9763	J.D.	I — I know... I'm a doctor.
9764	Dr. Cox	You know, Eunice, you never even woulda made that catch if you weren't such an all-purpose nerd, sitting home alone on a Saturday night, watching some medical special on TV!
9765	J.D.	First of all, in your face, because it was Friday night; and secondly, I woulda made the catch regardless — you see, if you use your head and do some homework, medicine is just... it's basically science!
9766	Dr. Cox	Oh, puh-lease explain medicine to me! Because, without you, I don't know what to do!
9767	Dr. Kelso	Admitting it is the first step, Perry! Am I right, Ace?
9768	J.D.	You are correct, sir! Haha—
9769	Dr. Cox	That's enough on that one — I think we've clearly exhausted it.
9770	Jordan	Hey, Stud.
9771	Dr. Cox	Hello.
9772	Jordan	I hear wonder boy spanked your ass harder than I usually do.
9773	Dr. Cox	Ahh, such a lucky fetus!
9774	Dr. Cox	Not another damn word.
9775	Jordan	Yeah, I'll say whatever I want.
9776	J.D.'s Thoughts	Hell, yeah.
9777	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9778	Dr. Cox	Yes, hello? Could we please get my hormonal, extremely annoying ex-wife's amnio underway?
9779	Jordan	Wow, I can't wait to write that down in the baby journal.
9780	Jordan	Could you be a bigger ass right now?
9781	Dr. Cox	Could you have a bigger ass right now?
9782	Dr. Cox	Owww!
9783	Carla	Why does he keep going back to her?
9784	Turk	I don't know. Why do people keep marrying Larry King? The man looks like a frog.
9785	Carla	Look, Dr. Cox and I go way back — I just hate to see him setting himself up to get hurt like this. I'm gonna talk to him.
9786	Turk	Here we go.
9787	Carla	What? Where we go?
9788	Turk	Sometimes you have a habit of telling other people how to live their lives, and... maybe, possibly, sometimes... people don't appreciate it that's— a little.
9789	Carla	Puh-lease! When do I ever get involved in people's personal business?
9790	Carla	Elliot, listen to me — you have to sit down and make a budget.
9791	Elliot	You know, I called my mom today, to see if she could convince my dad to send some cash, right? She says I should try and think of this whole thing as some kind of opportunity, and then she hung up on me!
9792	J.D.	Just like that?
9793	Elliot	Well, I may have told her that she spends more money dying her roots than I do on groceries. Still, this whole thing is just as much her fault as it is my father's — neither one of them prepared me for this.
9794	J.D.	Look, Elliot, my dad's an office supplies salesman. A bad one. So things were a little different for me, growing up.
9795	***Flashback	Little J.D. and his dad sit on the sofa in their living room. Each one wears a party hat.
9796	J.D.'s Dad	See, this is a bicycle bell. Now, you hold on to this, because I'm gonna give you a different part every year. Maybe after the party, we can take it out for a spin!
9797	Little J.D.	Great.
9798	J.D.'s Dad	'Kay?
9799	J.D.	Still waiting on that kick-stand.
9800	Elliot	It's just harder for me because I've always had everything. I got used to it. You guys never had to deal with that.
9801	Carla	Yeah, we're lucky.
9802	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9803	J.D.	I think patients are like snowflakes — no two are alike.
9804	Nurse Roberts	All right, we've got two new admissions — both male, both mid-forties, both with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
9805	J.D.'s Thoughts	I bet that snowflake thing is bogus, too.
9806	Dr. Cox	I say we let Super Doc here take 'em.
9807	J.D.	Oh, are you too busy eating sour grapes?
9808	Dr. Cox	Look who peeked in his shorts and found a pair! What are you, feeling like you finally took on the old man in a game of one-on-one and kicked his ass? Well, here's the news-flash, there, Skeetch: It was a fluke!
9809	J.D.	Well, believe what you want to believe. I'll do it again.
9810	Dr. Cox	All right, fair enough, here's your chance — two identical patients. I say we divide 'em up, just like in The Parent Trap. One goes with the sexy, free-wheeling, bachelor dad — hello. The other goes with the whiny, neurotic, sexually repressed mom — oh, just you all over.
9811	Dr. Cox	Oh, and I checked tonight's TV listings — there is no special on that disease, so you're gonna want to stop at the Blockbuster.
9812	J.D.	Please. I know all there is to know about thrombotic... thrombo... cyto — cytop-top-top-top... toppee— toppee—
9813	Nurse Roberts	Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
9814	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9815	Turk	Yeah, baby, just walk right by him. Okay? Just walk right by him. I'm proud of you. I'm... I'm so proud of you!
9816	Carla	Dr. Cox, hi!
9817	Turk	Dammit, I said walk right by him!
9818	Carla	Ohhhh.
9819	Turk	Hey, hey!
9820	Carla	Listen, um... We just think that getting back with Jordan might be a mistake.
9821	Carla	You guys just don't seem to... What am I trying to say, baby?
9822	Turk	I'unno.
9823	Carla	You just don't connect the way a couple should. Do you know what I mean?
9824	Dr. Cox	That pretty much the way you feel about it, there, Gandhi?
9825	Turk	Mmm-mm-mm!
9826	Dr. Cox	Interesting.
9827	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9828	Elliot	Mr. Bragen, it is so great to see you back in the hospital!
9829	Mr. Bragen	Woo-hoo! I've got a tube in my penis.
9830	Elliot	Come on, you're just a little dehydrated from the chemo. Plus, there are no signs whatsoever of your pancreatic cancer! You should be ecstatic! I mean, nine months ago, I told you you only had eight months to live, remember?
9831	Mr. Bragen	I vaguely recall that.
9832	Elliot	Yeah, of course you do. That is totally my fault! Who knew we could cure cancer!
9833	Mr. Bragen	I prepared myself, you know? I was really ready.
9834	Elliot	Yeah.
9835	Mr. Bragen	Dr. Reid, have you ever had to face your own mortality?
9836	Elliot	Before senior prom, I tried to wax my own eyebrows, and took them both clean off. Fft! Yeah!
9837	Elliot	And by that, I mean no. Never.
9838	Mr. Bragen	Must have been a tough time for you, though.
9839	Elliot	Ohhh, sure.
9840	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9841	J.D.	Thanks for starting the Solu-Medrol on my TTP patient. And, Laverne, I'm sorry I'm being such a pain about this guy, it's just that Dr. Cox and I have this little competition going... and I know that probably seems insensitive to you....
9842	Nurse Roberts	Sweetheart, you don't have to explain yourself to me. But you'd better get your story straight when you come face-to-face with Jesus.
9843	J.D.'s Thoughts	Hmmm... the chart for Dr. Cox's TTP patient. I could look and see, but I'm not that insecure about my—
9844	J.D.	Oops! I. Will. Get. It!
9845	J.D.	Yes! He's doing the exact same thing!
9846	J.D.'s Narration	When you work in a hospital, and things are going well, you should enjoy it while you can.
9847	J.D.'s Narration	Because, around every corner, there's something waiting to take it all away.
9848	Ted	Dr. Reid, I need to talk to you about your patient, Mr. Bragen.
9849	Elliot	Isn't it great! He's cancer-free!
9850	Ted	Yay. ...He's suing you for malpractice.
9851	Carla	It's okay, relax. I told him how I felt, he listened, and nobody got hurt! It's fine!
9852	Jordan	Yeah, which one of you two's been messing with my business?
9853	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, every once in a while, you manage to get away scot-free.
9854	J.D.	Hey, Dr. Cox! You'll be happy to know that I did everything for my patient that you did for yours.
9855	Dr. Cox	Oh, my God; I care so little, I almost passed out!
9856	Dr. Kelso	Hey, Ace. Your TTP patient coded — I pronounced him.
9857	J.D.	He died?
9858	Dr. Kelso	I certainly hope so, otherwise that autopsy's gonna be a bitch!
9859	Dr. Cox	Boy, that's tough.
9860	J.D.	What?
9861	Dr. Cox	I'd stay and talk you through this, but I gotta go check on my patient; you see, he's still alive.
9862	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, no.
9863	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9864	J.D.	How the hell did my patient die? I mean, you started corticosteroids, I started corticosteroids; you did plasmapheresis, I did plasmapheresis; you yelled at Mark the orderly, I yelled at Mark the orderly.
9865	J.D.	Hey, Mark.
9866	Orderly	"Hey, Mark!"
9867	J.D.	See? He's pissed!
9868	Dr. Cox	That's because his name is Frank. Now, as far as your patient's concerned, well, Newbie, I'm afraid you forgot one very important thing.
9869	J.D.'s Narration	For whatever reason, I was finally fed up.
9870	J.D.	You know what, I've been working my ass off here for the last year and a half, and the last thing I need is another one of your condescending, never-ending speeches where you spoon-feed me some giant lesson and call me a girl's name.
9871	Dr. Cox	Well, then, have it your way, there, Carol. 'Cause I'm out.
9872	Dr. Cox	Good luck, everyone.
9873	J.D.	Go ahead, walk away! Because I'm not gonna obsess about this!
9874	J.D.	Can you put a rush on this autopsy? I gotta figure this out.
9875	J.D.	You got some crumbs in his hair.
9876	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9877	Elliot	A lawsuit!? So you're suing me because you're not dying?
9878	Mr. Bragen	Dr. Reid, I didn't want to face my mortality; you forced me to. And now I can't earn any money because my job seems trivial. I can't be in a relationship because what's the point? Oh, and here's the topper: Remember my horrible, judgmental father I hadn't spoken to in fifteen years? Well, good news, Doc — we patched things up! And guess who's coming over Saturday to watch the game and tell me what a jerk I am!
9879	Elliot	Well, you asked me to estimate how much time you had left!
9880	Mr. Bragen	And you told me I'd be dead by now!
9881	Elliot	Well, you're not! So sue me!
9882	Mr. Bragen	I am!
9883	Elliot	It was a figure of speech! And your dad was right about you!
9884	Mr. Bragen	Why don't you tell him yourself.
9885	Elder Bragen	Hey, ass-face!
9886	Mr. Bragen	Hiya, Pops.

9888	Turk	Excuse me, ma'am? Jordan?
9889	Turk	Carla has something she'd like to tell you. Carla?
9890	Carla	I didn't mean to upset you. Even though everything I said was true and you know it.
9891	Turk	Baby, that is a God-awful apology. That is just God-awful.
9892	Jordan	It's 'cause she's not really sorry. Honey, I know your type — it is so easy to see other people's problems from way up there on your pedestal. But you better be careful up there, 'cause if you fall off, and have to walk around down here with the rest of us? I don't know! You might catch a glimpse of yourself in a mirror, or surface of a pond, your boyfriend's gigantic, shiny head... and trust me, you're not gonna like what you see.
9893	Turk	My head's not—
9894	Jordan	Ow. Ow.
9895	Turk	A little help, here!

9897	Dr. Walsh	Sorry, kid. I didn't see anything unusual.
9898	J.D.	Couldn't he have bled out, or had an MI?
9899	Dr. Walsh	I don't know. I didn't look for any of those basic things, because I'm horrible at my job.
9900	Dr. Cox	Dr. Walsh. Murder, She Wrote!
9901	J.D.	Okay, fine, you caught me — I'm checking on my patient.
9902	Dr. Cox	How is that guy doing?
9903	Dr. Walsh	Not great!
9904	Dr. Cox	What in the hell is going on in here?
9905	OB-GYN	The amnio triggered premature labor.
9906	Dr. Cox	Excuse me, she's only twenty-four weeks. Jordan, cut it out right now!
9907	Jordan	Is he yelling at me?
9908	OB-GYN	Yes, he is. I'm gonna give you a shot of terbutaline.
9909	Jordan	And you know what else? He said I had a fat ass before.
9910	Dr. Cox	The nice kind?

9912	Ted	Look, I — I don't get a lot of women in here. What's your honest opinion of these drapes?
9913	Elliot	W— They're fine, Ted. But I'm getting sued!
9914	Ted	You're right. You're right, you're right. Now, by "fine"—
9915	Elliot	Ted!
9916	Ted	Okay, um, just time to calm down, now.
9917	Elliot	I'm fine.
9918	Ted	Actually, I was talking to myself. Now, uh, you haven't discussed the lawsuit with Mr. Bragen, have you?
9919	***Flashback	Mr. Bragen's Room
9920	Elliot	A lawsuit!?
9921	Elliot	It, uh, it sort of came up, yeah.
9922	Ted	Oh, God! Tell me you didn't antagonize him!
9923	Elliot	So sue me!
9924	Ted	Or admit fault!?
9925	Elliot	That is totally my fault!
9926	Ted	Oh, come on! A good lawyer couldn't win this case!!!
9927	Dr. Kelso	Ah! New drapes. They're awful!
9928	Elliot	Dr. Kelso, why does everything keep happening to me?
9929	Dr. Kelso	Take a breath, Dr. Reid. In, and out; that's it. That's it.
9930	Dr. Kelso	Now, you went to four years of college, and four years of medical school, so I can safely presume that you are at least eight.
9931	Dr. Kelso	My God, little girl, grow up and say "how do" to the world of modern medicine! My God! I've been sued four times!
9932	Dr. Kelso	Come on, Ted, let's go.
9933	Ted	Let's go!
9934	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9935	Turk	I think you should just go in there and apologize to her.

9939	Dr. Cox	Laverne? Would you please have the nurse covering Jordan page me the moment she wakes up?
9940	Nurse Roberts	Sure.
9941	Dr. Cox	Thank you.
9942	J.D.	Hey, Dr. Cox. I'm sorry, I was just so frustrated before. So, now I'm here, why don't you go ahead and tell me what I forgot?
9943	Dr. Cox	Can I? Really?
9944	J.D.	Sure! Hit me.
9945	Dr. Cox	How about, "Go to hell, Shakira."
9946	J.D.	What?!
9947	Dr. Cox	What, now that you've decided you're ready to listen, how does it work, huh? You gonna pull a string on my back? Well, step right up and give it a tug. But, I'm warning you, I bet it keeps coming up "Go to hell, Shakira."
9948	J.D.	Why do you always have to be like that? You know that I try harder than anyone in this place, and you never give me any credit!
9949	Dr. Cox	Now, you listen to me, Newbie. I'm not doing this because I get my jollies off of being your mentor, and I'm damn sure not doing it so that years from now I can say, "Boy, I knew him when." I'm doing it because if I don't, people would die.
9950	J.D.	Thanks for your help.
9951	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9952	Elliot	You know what, Mr. Bragen? I figured something out.
9953	Mr. Bragen	That damn nurse broke my bed.
9954	Elliot	That's just it — you blame everyone else for anything that goes wrong in your life. Like this. The nurse didn't break your bed. You just press this button.
9955	Elliot	All right, it is...broken. The point is, if you hate your job, maybe you need to switch careers; if you can't get into a relationship, maybe you have problems with commitment, huh? And I know that I'm right, 'cause I'm the exact same way: I blame my parents for not preparing me for the real world, I blame this hospital for taking up all of my time; I'm even blaming you for jeopardizing my future! But, you know what? It's time for me to grow up and start holding myself accountable. And I'm doing it.
9956	Mr. Bragen	Good for you!
9957	Elliot	You're, um, still suing me, aren't you.
9958	Mr. Bragen	Yeah. But I feel like now you'll be able to handle it!
9959	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9960	Turk	You know what? We're just gonna have to get him fixed. Good news is, he doesn't need to go to a vet — 'cause we could just pop these things right off!
9961	Turk	YES! Baby, you have got to tell J.D., because he is not gonna believe it!
9962	Carla	Jordan was right about me. I'm insecure, and I judge people to cover up for it. I mean, even right now, all I can think about is to tell you that you're a surgeon now, and if you want to be taken seriously you have to start acting like an adult.
9963	Turk	And you had to say all of that?
9964	Carla	Well, you have a habit of not listening to things unless people spell them out for you!— Oh, my God, I can't stop!
9965	Turk	Baby, maybe it's something you need to work on, that's all?
9966	Carla	Sweetie, I promise you, I will never, ever, tell you what to do ever again.
9967	Turk	Yeah, you will. But with me, it's okay, because I love you.
9968	Turk	Besides, I barely listen, anyway.
9969	Turk	Come on, Rowdy! Let's go, boy! Let's hit up the fourth floor.
9970	Turk	Whoa, whoa, boy! Whoa! Slow down!
9971	J.D.'s Narration	As I sat there, still searching for answers about my patient, I realized that I still needed Dr. Cox. It's hard to face a harsh truth about yourself.
9972	J.D.'s Narration	I guess the only thing you can do is try to take positive steps.
9973	J.D.'s Narration	Unfortunately, it's hard to take positive steps when you've burned the bridge you need to walk across.
9974	Dr. Cox	It was luck.
9975	J.D.	What?
9976	Dr. Cox	The thing that you forgot? Turns out, whatever you know about medicine, ultimately, luck or fate or God or... who knows what is always gonna end up playing a much bigger role in the whole thing than you and I ever will. Hell, it was lucky you were watching that show the other night. And it was unlucky that your patient went the other way, even though you did absolutely everything right; and, for the record, you did. I was looking over your shoulder every step of the way.
9977	J.D.	Thanks.
9978	Dr. Cox	Wasn't a favor, Newbie. It was my job.
9979	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
9980	J.D.	Hey, how ya doin'.
9981	Turk	I know we put on a hell of a show, but, dude, put some shades on or something!
9982	J.D.	Let's not make a big deal out of this.
9983	Carla	J.D., when was the last time you got laid?
9984	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, just subtly take the spotlight off yourself.
9985	J.D.	Once, on a red-eye flight, Turk groped a trans-sexual.
9986	Turk	Baby, it was dark, and he/she had a body that was rockin'!
9987	J.D.'s Thoughts	Mission accomplished.
9988	Carla	We're talking about you right now, studly.
9989	J.D.	Okay! So I'm in a bit of a dry spell.... I have no idea what to do with myself.
9990	Turk	Why don't you give Rowdy a bath he smells a little ripe.
9991	J.D.	Please! I'm a young, single player with a heart of gold. I should be able to stir something up.
9992	J.D.	How _do_ you get so dirty?
9993	J.D.	...Rowdy!
9994	J.D.'s Narration	I'm not the only one in a rut.
9995	Elliot	My life is a mess!
9996	J.D.	At least you're pretty.
9997	Elliot	Yeah, well, pretty don't pay the rent!
9998	Carla	It does for my sister.
9999	Elliot	Oh, my God, your sister's a prostitute!?
10000	Carla	She's a _model_. Come on, Elliot, we talked about thinking before we speak.
10001	Elliot	Yeah, I know, I was just frazzled. I stopped taking my dad's money, so I can't pay the bills; I'm getting kicked out of my apartment; and thank-you to this stupid hospital, I haven't even had time to look for a new place!
10002	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes the hospital seems like a big, hungry monster that feeds on our personal lives.
10003	***Fantasy Shot	Utilizing some special effects, the front of the hospital darkens, morphing into a monster. It opens its doors like a giant mouth and spews fire.
10004	J.D.'s Narration	It affects all of us.
10005	J.D.	Morning, Dr. Cox!
10006	Dr. Cox	Oh, ho, ho, Denise! I know it's morning. If it was last night, I'd still be with my extremely pregnant ex-wife, trying to get her to calm down with a chair and a whip because believe it or not I somehow managed to forget to bring home the _curly fries_. Do you see where I'm going here? Yes, no, maybe so? Talk to her!
10007	Nurse Roberts	The man's got troubles.
10008	Lady	You know, you're about one of the cutest doctors I've ever met! Give me a kiss!
10009	J.D.	Ha! Well.... Put it in your pocket and save it for later!
10010	J.D.'s Narration	The monster kills everything that's beautiful. Everything! ....Except Lisa, the Gift Shop girl!
10011	Choir Director	Okay, boys, remember, now: When we get upstairs, it's the trauma ward, not the "drama ward," so smiles, everyone. Smiles.
10012	J.D.'s Thoughts	Whatever. Dry spell, prepare to be moistened!
10013	J.D.	Hey, Lisa! How you doin'?
10014	Lisa	J.D., I can't give you free gum.
10015	J.D.	Free gum No! You know, I was just thinking, you're probably one of those girls that's so pretty that no one ever has the courage to ask you out.
10016	Lisa	No, I get asked out all the time.
10017	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, momentary set-back. Regroup. Regroup!
10018	J.D.	Hey, go out with me.

10044	J.D.	Look, you can either be a jerk as usual or you can accept this gracious offer and get some caramel draped in nougat. Your choice, Jumpsuit.

10046	Dr. Cox	You know, Jordan, I have to tell you despite how crazy-hormonal you are, there is something about a pregnant woman that's almost spiritual.
10047	Jordan	Really?
10048	Dr. Cox	Honestly you
10049	Jordan	Mm-hmm.
10050	Dr. Cox	you have never looked so beautiful.
10051	Jordan	It's the giant boobs, isn't it.
10052	Dr. Cox	Well, have you seen them lately?
10053	Jordan	Yes. Relax.
10054	J.D.	I've seen bigger.
10055	J.D.	No, not you. Although, kudos!
10056	Nurse Roberts	Mmm-hmm.
10057	Jordan	You know what I hate?
10058	Dr. Cox	So many things....
10059	Jordan	That's true. I stay at your house almost every night, and even though I feel like crap in the morning, I've gotta drive all the way back to my apartment to get ready and then drive all the way back here to go to board meetings.
10060	Dr. Cox	Well, then, why don't you just leave your boobs and some other stuff at my place?
10061	Jordan	Really?
10062	Dr. Cox	Well, yeah.... If it saves you the hassle, bring it on.
10063	Jordan	Well, great. See you tonight.
10064	J.D.	So, it appears Mrs. Watson has developed a post-op infection at her thyroidectomy site.
10065	Mrs. Watson	Ow!
10066	Dr. Cox	Newbie, when a patient has an infection, I make it a general policy not to actually push on it. Just start Ancef 1 gram Q 8 hours, and oh, my God, did I just ask my ex-wife to move in with me?
10067	J.D.	Mmm-hmm.
10068	J.D.	What? You don't own that!

10070	Carla	Turk! Come help me wrap presents!
10071	Turk	Baby. Do you realize how long it's been since we've had an afternoon off, just the two of us?
10072	Carla	Yeah....
10073	Turk	I mean, I'm thinking I should give you a sensual massage...rub your feet a little...and maybe, if you're interested, sex you up and what-not!
10074	Carla	Come here.
10075	Turk	I'll get the TV.
10076	Carla	No, you know what? Leave it on. I know how much you like 'The Jeffersons'.
10077	Turk	Baby, you're a gift from God!
10078	Turk	Here come daddy! Roooaaarrr!
10079	Turk	I'm gonna rock your world!

10082	Elliot	Huh! I put all those fliers up, and nobody wants me to live with them!
10083	J.D.	Oh, come on, Elliot. I'm sure you'll eventually find a roommate who's a clean, non-smoking vegetarian that rinses the shower thoroughly after each usage.
10084	Elliot	Oh, well, if you don't, it gets mildewy.
10085	J.D.	You know, you should move in with my friend: Anal McLooney.
10086	Elliot	I am so screwed! I had to move out of my apartment this morning all of my stuff is outside in a truck.
10087	J.D.	Why don't you just crash with me and Turk till you find a place?
10088	Elliot	I am so tired of everyone always thinking that I need to be rescued! Okay, J.D.?
10089	J.D.	Fine.
10090	Dr. Kelso	Can anyone tell me the bacterial etiology of toxic shock syndrome?
10091	Dr. Kelso	Oh, I beg your pardon. So many doctors standing around, I assumed it was rounds!
10092	Elliot	Oh
10093	Dr. Kelso	But you were looking at the wall, so that means it's an...art exhibit! When does the gay gentleman come 'round with the tray of champagne?
10094	Elliot	Sir, my father cut me off
10095	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Reid, this is not Bring Your Problems to Work Day. This is just Work Day.
10096	Elliot	But, sir! Only one person took a phone number...so far!
10097	Todd	Someone's getting a late-night drunk call from The Todd.
10098	J.D.	Lucky girl.
10099	Todd	Yeah!
10100	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
10101	J.D.	All right, Mrs. Carlson, the surgeon that's gonna come by and do your lymph node dissection is a very handsome young man, so I don't want you to forget about me, okay? I'm serious, you naughty girl!
10102	Dr. Cox	Sure, Jordan...I guess you could take over the master bathroom. But, would you do me a favor and leave my sleeping pills out in case, when I get home, I want to take 300 of them? Okay, bye.
10103	J.D.	I can't stop obsessing about this date I have tonight. What do you think I should do?
10104	Dr. Cox	Well, for starters, you should probably go ahead and thank your lucky stars that you finally found a gal who's into same-sex relationships.
10105	J.D.	You know, Perry
10106	Dr. Cox	"Perry"?
10107	J.D.	Yeah, I'm trying it out. I find, with the ladies, if you're clear with your intentions right off the bat, they just fall in to place. A.Q.?
10108	Dr. Cox	What!?
10109	J.D.	"A.Q." is sort of a new, hip expression means "Any questions?"
10110	Dr. Cox	Look, please don't think I'm impressed because you managed to score a sympathy date with whatever homely-looking chick is managing the gift shop nowadays.
10111	Lisa	J.D.! You ready to go?
10112	J.D.	Oh, yeah, the word you're looking for is "Wow." And the words I'm looking for are "In your face." Yeah! I'm ready, let's get going.
10113	J.D.	P.O. peace out.
10114	Dr. Cox	Jordan, if you're feeling like crap, then I'll come straight home Of...course, with the food. No, I don't necessarily know if there is anything bigger than a super-size, but I'll I'll ask the guy.
10115	Jordan	Get _two_ super-sizes!

10120	Turk	Was that before or after I rocked your world?
10121	Carla	He's a good man, he's a good man, he's a good man....
10122	Turk	Baby, you know I get nervous when you start chanting.
10123	Carla	Turk, what happened to all my stuff? The massage? The back, the feet? I let you watch 'The Jeffersons'!
10124	Turk	Baby, I was...just exhausted from work.
10125	Carla	Well, when you were an intern you were always exhausted from work, but you always made time for romance.
10126	Turk	Oh, that's 'cause I was still trying to get into your delicates.
10127	Carla	Oh, my God.

10129	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Reid? What are you doing in here?
10130	Elliot	Um...
10131	Elliot	Sorry, hi Dr. Kelso, I just, uh...I um..... I was on call. Yeah.
10132	Dr. Kelso	Well, I have the call sheet right here, and, uh......your name doesn't seem to be on it? But what do I know.... I'm just a kindly old man who doesn't know the difference between a doctor on call and one who maybe just needs a warm bed for the night.
10133	Elliot	Oh, I've just been so swamped with work, I couldn't even make time to find a new place.
10134	Dr. Kelso	I understand. Life is hard, and all that. But, if you want a bed in my hospital, you better have a damn rent check...or a massive coronary in the next five seconds. And, believe me, missy, either one's fine with me.
10135	Elliot	Thank you, sir?
10136	Dr. Kelso	No problem.

10138	J.D.	I had a really good time tonight.
10139	Lisa	I gotta tell you, I was a little nervous when you spent the first five minutes talking through a napkin.
10140	J.D.	Oh, that wasn't me that was Nappy, The Ice-Breaking Puppet.
10141	Lisa	Oh!
10142	J.D.	That little guy earned his money tonight.
10143	Lisa	So you think you're in, huh?
10144	J.D.	Oh, come on, I am so in.
10145	Lisa	Come on, you can't be sure.
10146	J.D.	No, I feel pretty good about it. You want me.
10147	Lisa	I don't!
10148	J.D.	Uh, yeah, I'm a doctor; all the symptoms are there you do.
10149	Lisa	Just kiss me.
10150	J.D.	Whoa. Heh. Uh.... You know, I thought I had to sneeze, but it was a false alarm. Let's do this.
10151	Lisa	Okay.
10152	J.D.	You know what it is? It's like a tickling. I got this, like this, like weird, like...it's a flutter. Erp!
10153	Lisa	Nappy?
10154	J.D.	Yeah?
10155	Lisa	I want you to stop fooling around, and Give me a kiss.
10156	J.D.'s Narration	I guess you never know how the monster's gonna attack.
10157	Carla	All right, we need to talk about this.
10158	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes it pulls you away at the absolute worst time.
10159	Turk	Babe, I'm sorry.
10160	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes it even takes the roof over your head.
10161	J.D.'s Narration	And sometimes, the monster takes something you never thought you could lose....
10162	J.D.'s Narration	...Like your mojo.
10163	Lisa	Is that a roll of quarters in your pocket or are you just having a really good time?
10164	J.D.	Actually, it's a roll of quarters. It's uh...laundry day! Heh.
10165	Lisa	Oh.
10166	J.D.	See ya.
10167	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
10168	J.D.'s Thoughts	So, Little J.D. isn't rising to the occasion. It's not a big deal! Nobody knows about this but me!
10169	Dr. Cox	Hey, Newbie, what's up?
10170	J.D.	Everything! Everything's up!
10171	Dr. Kelso	Rise and shine, sport!
10172	J.D.'s Thoughts	What, did someone send out a flier?!
10173	Todd	Hey, J.D.! How's your penis?
10174	J.D.'s Thoughts	All right, calm down, he says that to everyone.
10175	Todd	Hey, Goldman! How's your penis?
10176	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, you're freaking out! Just keep your head down, and move.
10177	Janitor	Hm? Oh, I get it! I haven't paid you back, so you won't even look at me?
10178	J.D.	No.
10179	Janitor	It's been one day, you greedy little bastard!
10180	J.D.'s Thoughts	See what you did!
10181	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Reid, your truck is double-parked.
10182	J.D.'s Narration	Luckily for me, I had a friend I could talk to about anything.
10183	J.D.	Hey, Turk. Do you ever have any trouble getting your manhood going?
10184	Turk	Hell, no!
10185	J.D.	Heh, heh. Me neither, dawg!
10186	J.D.'s Thoughts	Apparently I'm the only one here with women problems.
10187	Jordan	Listen, Perry, shockingly, I'm not really looking to make the permanent move to your little bachelor cave over there at Swingers Towers. What happened is, is you made a kind gesture, and I made the mistake of thinking you could follow actually through with it. Do you get it?
10188	Carla	You don't get it, do you, Turk? We've only been together for a year-and-a-half the romance can't be gone yet! Does this make any sense to you?
10189	Lisa	Because it doesn't to me. One minute, we're clicking; and the next, you're running for your life. What's going on?
10190	J.D.'s Narration	I know we seem insensitive, but in a crunch-time, most guys are smart enough to say the right thing.
10191	Turk	Baby...you have got to chill!
10192	Dr. Cox	I'm sorry, um...crazy person says what?
10193	Jordan	What!?
10194	Dr. Cox	Thatta girl.
10195	J.D.'s Narration	But sometimes the worst thing a guy can say is nothing at all.
10196	Lisa	You know what? Forget it.
10197	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
10198	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Reid! I have no reading material for my daily post-lunch...well, let's just call it "reading session." I need your research proposal. Or a Vanity Fair if you have one.
10199	Elliot	Dr. Kelso, if I could just get...a little more time on that
10200	Dr. Kelso	Oh, I'm sorry, sweetheart. I'm fresh out of special treatment today. I used it all trying not to stare at that albino doctor down in Radiology.
10201	Carla	Don't let him get to you! Just keep saying positive things to yourself.
10202	Elliot	It's too much! I'm just one person!
10203	Carla	Atta girl!
10204	Elliot	Sometimes I just get so jealous of Turk, you know? I mean, we're residents now, and we're just so swamped, and he just never seems to show it. I guess...that's because he's got you to pick up the slack when he doesn't have the energy.
10205	Carla	Yeah.... You would think so.
10206	Carla	Aren't you gonna get that?
10207	Elliot	Nah, it's just Todd. He's already called, like, four times to ask if I want to move into his pants.
10208	J.D.'s Narration	You never expect a cliché to be an actual conversation starter.
10209	Turk	Women! Huh?
10210	Dr. Cox	Tell me about it.
10211	J.D.	It's like they're from another planet!
10212	Dr. Cox	Okay. I'm going to engage you two in a conversation. And you speak of it to no one, agreed?
10213	J.D.	Okay...?
10214	Dr. Cox	It has gotten to the point where I'm starting to go back in my head over all my old relationships. I mean, don't get me wrong, it's not like I'm going to sit here and count up all the women I've ever slept with....
10215	Turk	Twelve.
10216	J.D.	Nine.
10217	Dr. Cox	Eighteen. But not one of them ever really understood me.
10218	Turk	I'm feelin' you, man. I mean, I consider myself a really romantic guy who's just a little stressed out. And I thought the one person who'd understand that would be Carla.
10219	Dr. Cox	You know what the weird thing is, is that I'm actually _trying_ this time.
10220	Turk	I just wonder if I'm what she really wants.
10221	Dr. Cox	I just wonder if I'll ever be able to make it work out with anyone.
10222	J.D.	My peep's on the fritz.
10223	Turk	Dude!
10224	Dr. Cox	Oh, poor Newbie.
10225	J.D.	No, no! No, no, no, no! No, I'm talking about you guys! 'Cause y-y-y-you guys are like you guys are like my peeps, you're my dawgs, and you on the fritz. So, there that's where I get "peeps"/"fritz" came from.
10226	Dr. Cox	God love you, Newbie.
10227	Dr. Cox	Thank you for...giving me some perspective.
10228	Janitor	There's your stupid dollar. And, by the way, your new nickname is Pee-Pee LeFritz. Enjoy.

10231	J.D.	Is this where you're sleeping tonight?
10232	Elliot	Yeah, so? It's, uh, it's cozy.... Hospital-adjacent.
10233	J.D.	Elliot! Come on! This is crazy you're living out of a van like a hobo...or...Jewel.
10234	Elliot	Her poetry changed my life.
10235	J.D.	Look, I know you want to show everyone you can stand on your own two feet, but you don't have to prove anything to me. Come on, come stay with me and Turk.
10236	Turk	What'd you page me to the roof for?
10237	Carla	Well, I was thinking that you work so hard.... And that if I want surprise and romance that maybe it's my turn to be the one who brings it. So, I brought us a couple of salads...
10238	Turk	That's great.
10239	Carla	...a box of thirty-six hot-wings...
10240	Turk	Now that's what I'm talkin' 'bout!
10241	Carla	...and some blue cheese dressing!
10242	Turk	I LOVE THIS WOMAN!
10243	J.D.'s Narration	I guess, in the end, the monster's always gonna be there.
10244	Jordan	Curly fries?
10245	Dr. Cox	Aww!
10246	J.D.'s Narration	And sometimes that means letting a friend help you out.
10247	Elliot	Um...thanks again, J.D.
10248	J.D.	Don't sweat it. Well, have a good night.
10249	Elliot	You too.
10250	J.D.'s Narration	As for me, I just have to hope that my problem will eventually work itself out.
10251	Elliot	Merry Christmas.
10252	J.D.	It was exactly what I wanted.

10254	J.D.'s Narration	Since she lost her apartment, I decided to let Elliot crash on my floor.
10255	J.D.	How did this happen?
10256	Elliot	J.D., I'm homeless; I have no money, and everything I own is outside in a truck my life's a mess. Plus, you were...going through...a lot, too....
10257	J.D.	My peep was on the fritz. Much better now, thank you for asking.
10258	Elliot	The point is, we were stressed out and vulnerable, and we made a mistake.
10259	J.D.	Four times.... And a half, if you count that last thing.
10260	Elliot	By the way, that third time? Wow! Where did you learn that?

10265	J.D.	I don't know...but she seems to _love_ it!
10266	J.D.	The Congo. But look, Elliot, I think I think you're right last night was great, but w-we can't keep doing this.
10267	J.D.	Dr. Reid.
10268	Elliot	Dr. Dorian.
10269	J.D.'s Narration	Mistake or not, one cool thing about sex is, it always seems to put you in a good mood.
10270	J.D.'s Narration	Hell, I think it even cheers up the people around you.
10271	Dr. Cox	Oh, joy I get to work on Mrs. Credin with The Wonder Twins. Dear Lord, what in thy most holy name have I done to have offended thee so?
10272	Elliot	My bother Bradley and I used to always pretend that we were The Wonder Twins he would always become "Form of a Dragon!" and then I would want to be a dragon, too, but he said I had to be something made of water. So I'd be like, "Shape of an Ice Dragon!" And then...he would say that I was copying him and he'd breathe on me and I'd have to melt, but it was still _so_ awesome.
10273	Dr. Cox	That's funny, I don't recall asking for a really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really re-hhhheally boring story. My God, Barbie! Don't you understand no one cares?
10274	Turk	I care.
10275	Dr. Cox	Correction: No one important cares. Now, Mrs. Credin is in post-op, so let's start her out by CAT-scanning her abdomen. Oh, and, gosh, all kidding aside I'd really like to see us work together on this one. Come on, now! "Duh-duh-duh-du-du-du-duhn!" Hands in! "Duh-duh-duh-du-du-du-duhn!" Woo! Please!

10282	Woman	Actually, we wanted to know how you felt about it, Carla.
10283	Carla	Me?
10284	J.D.'s Narration	Don't get me wrong, Carla loves her patients but she also loves how much they love her.
10285	Carla	To be honest, I'm not a big fan. I mean, I've always wondered what the kid would say if it were up to him.

10307	J.D.	Oh, we're a train wreck.
10308	Elliot	So we can't keep doing this.
10309	J.D.	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hello, and whoa!
10310	Elliot	J.D., it's just sex.
10311	J.D.	Look, Elliot, we're adults. I don't think we have to apologize for enjoying what we're doing.
10312	J.D.'s Narration	And that's when she said the words every man is dying to hear.

10333	Turk	Elliot! You said you were gonna get that CAT-scan of Mrs. Credin's abdomen.
10334	Elliot	I have been crazy-busy. I was stuck on the phone all morning with bill collectors who, by the way, are obsessed with money! I spent an hour in my truck looking for clean bras because all I've got left is this date-night push-up one and, to be honest, I don't like working with these things under my chin all day. Plus, I am walking _someplace_ right now, and, for the life of me, I can't remember where.
10335	Turk	Don't worry about it, I'll take care of it for you.
10336	Elliot	Thanks.
10337	Turk	Mm-hmm.
10338	Elliot	Bathroom!
10339	Dr. Kelso	Does this name tag say "Chief of Medicine"?
10340	J.D.	Uh, yes, sir.
10341	Dr. Kelso	Funny. Because that couple back there thought it said, "Hi, I'm Bob, ask me about your baby's johnson!" Dammit, in my hospital, we do not go out on a limb with our opinions!
10342	Carla	So, what? If a patient has questions in 'your hospital,' you just ignore them?
10343	Dr. Kelso	Look: Stay away from definite answers. Leave yourself some wiggle room. Say things like, We'll do what we can, or We'll get back to you on that, or...Hell, I don't know.
10344	J.D.	Couldn't think of a third one, sir?
10345	Dr. Kelso	That _was_ the third one. Ass-face.
10346	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
10347	Dr. Cox	Hey, Chum! Whatta ya say? Listen, I just wanted to tell ya not to worry about getting that silly CAT-scan on Mrs. Credin; because it turns out I'm just gonna rip her stitches open, jam my head in there, and have a look around for myself.
10348	Turk	Okay, Dr.
10349	Dr. Cox	Dammit! When I tell you to do something, you sure as hell better get it done!
10350	J.D.'s Narration	It sucks being yelled at. Especially when it's someone else's fault.
10351	Todd	T-Dog, that was big of you to cover for Elliot. You know, I had a good mind to spank her yesterday.
10352	Turk	What, she screw up with one of your patients, too?
10353	Todd	No.
10354	Turk	Still, Elliot seems so frazzled, she keeps making one mistake after another. I mean, I wish I could help her out. I have no idea how that woman handles the stress.
10355	Elliot	Woo! I feel _so_ much better! See ya, bud!
10356	J.D.	Later, dude.
10357	Carla	You know, Mr. Woodbury's son is getting married this weekend; he keeps asking me if he's gonna be able to go.
10358	J.D.	He's had a nasty case of pneumonia. Let's see. Well, his leukocytosis is resolved, and his blood cultures are negative.... Tell him we'll do the best we can.
10359	Carla	Oh, come on! Can't we just tell him that he can go?
10360	J.D.	Where's the wiggle room in that? There's no wiggle!
10361	J.D.	Fine. Let me just tell him with you so I can enjoy it, too.
10362	Mr. Woodbury	Thank you so much!
10363	Carla	Oh! Oh, you're so very welcome! It's my pleasure.
10364	Mr. Woodbury	This is great.
10365	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
10366	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, just give her a casual nod you don't want Turk to know what's going on.
10367	Turk	Dude, you're totally hitting that.
10368	J.D.	How do you do that?
10369	Turk	It's a gift. Now, you remember what happened the last time you two got together, right?
10370	J.D.	Oh, relax, man. We're just having fun.
10371	Turk	What are you guys, just sex buddies or something?
10372	J.D.	Fo' shizzle.
10373	Turk	Okay.
10374	Turk	I don't wanna get all Dr. Phil on you, but the last time I checked, women have a hard time separating sex from emotions. So, you may think you're just tappin' that right now, but pretty soon she's gonna be like, "J.D., I need you."
10375	J.D.	Look, if it ever got that emotional, I'd break it off.
10376	Turk	Okay. Oh, by the way, dude right there is totally hitting that dude! He's totally hitting him!
10377	J.D.	You are good!
10378	Turk	I know.
10379	J.D.	I'm so glad Esteban found someone!

10381	Dr. Cox	What's up, Laverne?
10382	Nurse Roberts	This Friday, my church group's doing a production of 'Rent', if you want to go?
10383	Dr. Cox	Yeah.... What's up that doesn't make me want to shoot myself?
10384	Elliot	How's Mr., uh....Lawrence doing?
10385	Dr. Cox	I'm afraid that's no longer any of your business he's not your patient as of 2 o'clock this afternoon. He asked for a new doctor.
10386	Elliot	That's the second patient to switch off of my service today, what is the deal?
10387	Dr. Cox	Maybe they were both so overwhelmed by the high quality of your care that they just couldn't stand it another second.
10388	Elliot	You know what? I'm not gonna let you make me feel like crap today. Every doctor here including you has had patients switch off of them for no reason at all, and it is just some dumb little coinkydink that it happened to me twice on the same day. Now, if, uh, the two of you will excuse me, I have to go check on Mrs. Finnegan's chest x-rays.
10389	Nurse Roberts	Uh, no you don't. She switched off, too.
10390	J.D.'s Narration	Around here, things can turn bad in a heartbeat.
10391	Dr. Kelso	Sweetheart, Mr. Woodbury is still requiring a lot of O2, I'm afraid we're gonna have to keep him here over the weekend. Do me a favor: Give him the skinny, will you.
10392	J.D.'s Narration	I guess when you work in a world of uncertainty, it's great to have something at home you can count on.
10393	J.D.	Elliot? What are you doing?
10394	Elliot	Sitting in the dark...crying. So, you know, the usual.
10395	J.D.	Oh. Okay.
10396	Elliot	J.D., I had such a crappy day. I really need you right now. Come here.
10397	J.D.'s Thoughts	She needs you? Oh, my God, Turk was right. You have to stop kissing her, and put an end to this before she gets hurt!
10398	Elliot	Is there something wrong?
10399	J.D.'s Thoughts	Eh, she's a tough kid you can tell her later.
10400	J.D.	Nope!
10401	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
10402	J.D.'s Thoughts	What did you do? All right, don't panic! Maybe she didn't enjoy it.... Oh, come on, who're you kidding?
10403	Elliot	I just don't get it. I mean, why are so many of my patients switching off on me? Are my hands _that_ cold?
10404	J.D.	Ohhh.
10405	Elliot	You didn't tell anyone that I'm Republican, did you?
10406	J.D.	No!
10407	Elliot	God, this can't be happening! I'm a doctor! What the hell use is being a doctor if nobody lets you treat them? What is going on with my life?
10408	J.D.	Mmmmm.
10409	J.D.'s Thoughts	This is not the time to talk it out. So you just need to get out of the situation without making her suspicious.
10410	J.D.	Hello? ... Oh, hi, Mom! ... Yeah! I miss you, too! I haven't spoken to you in so long.
10411	J.D.	Hi, Mr. Turk. ... No, Chris isn't here. ... No! No, sir, I didn't say "Mom," I said..."mon," like, "Hey, mon, we be jammin'!" ... N-no, sir, I don't think all black people are Jamaican.
10412	J.D.	I I love you too, Mommy!
10413	J.D.	Sir, could you call back later? Chris will be home.

10415	Janitor	Yeah, there's been some break-ins, I had to change all the locks on these lockers. You should have gotten your new combination in the mail.
10416	J.D.	Well, I didn't. Do you know what it is?
10417	Janitor	Yeah.
10418	J.D.	But you're not gonna tell me, are you.
10419	Janitor	Can't. Janitor-locker confidentiality.
10420	J.D.'s Thoughts	He made that up.
10421	Turk	Are you watching 'Sesame Street'?
10422	Elliot	You know, when I was a kid, I had my first sex dream about Mr. Hooper. Least I think it was a sex dream he was trying to choke me.
10423	Turk	Yeah, that that's sweet. Um, what, are you on a break or something?
10424	Elliot	Well, I have nothing else to do, because none of my patients want to see me.
10425	Turk	But that's a good thing, right? Because, now, you have time to take care of your life!
10426	Elliot	Why are you being so weird?
10427	Dr. Cox	Well, of course, that could be because he's shaving his dome so much lately that the hair is actually starting to grow inward it's an affliction commonly known as the "infro." But, if I were to guess just exactly why he's been acting weird lately, I would say it's because...he's the one who's been steering your patients away from you.
10428	Dr. Cox	Discuss.
10429	J.D.'s Thoughts	Carla has to give Mr. Woodbury the bad news.
10430	Mr. Woodbury	I love this nurse ... She's wonderful!
10431	Carla	How bad could it be?
10432	Mr. Woodbury	Oh, look, here she is! Come on in! I want you to meet my family!
10433	J.D.'s Thoughts	I wonder how he'll take it?
10434	***Fantasy Shot	Carla shares the bad news.
10435	Mr. Woodbury	Take her! Out the window! Throw her out the window!
10436	Carla	Here goes.
10437	J.D.	Wait, wait, you know what? Come on...Mr. Woodbury's doing well enough to be discharged. I don't mind standing up to Kelso on this one. Time to take the "G-R" off my gratitude and give that old bastard some attitude, J.D. style!
10438	Carla	His office is that way.
10439	J.D.	I know, I have to go throw up first.
10440	Carla	Oh....'kay.

10443	Dr. Cox	Ohhh, good, Barbie! Now really access the anger!
10444	Elliot	How could you do that to me?
10445	Dr. Cox	Yeah, honestly. How could you?
10446	Turk	Okay, I just wanted to protect you give you a little break.
10447	Dr. Cox	The old "I'm trying to help you" gambit? Barbie, see through that. Yo' kick him! Yo' kick him right now!
10448	Turk	Elliot....
10449	Dr. Cox	"I'm sorry!"
10450	Turk	Elliot!
10451	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
10452	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, now's your chance. You're at work, so she won't get emotional. Walk in there, and tell her things are getting too serious. Just...butter her up first.
10453	J.D.	Well, look at you, Miss No One's Ever Gonna Want Me To Be Their Doctor Again! I don't see Mr. Ellis, here, complaining.
10454	Elliot	He's in a coma.
10455	J.D.	Elliot, we should talk.
10456	Elliot	I found out that Turk was telling my patients to switch off of my service.
10457	J.D.	What?
10458	Elliot	Yeah, he said he was trying to protect me.
10459	J.D.	I'll go talk to him.
10460	J.D.	That I.V. looks like it's infiltrating. Nurse must've screwed up.
10461	Elliot	Um. I did that.
10462	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
10463	Dr. Kelso	Well, what's with the mouthful of Chicklets, sweetheart?
10464	Carla	Oh, no special reason, sir.
10465	Dr. Kelso	Really? I thought it might be because young Dr. Dorian came to see me with his feathers all up and his voice a-crackin', and told me he was letting Mr. Woodbury go.
10466	Carla	Oh, did he?
10467	Dr. Kelso	Yup. And his knees were knocking so loud, I almost didn't see you standing above him, pulling the strings.
10468	Carla	Look, Dr. Kelso, all
10469	Dr. Kelso	Ah, maybe Mr. Woodbury will be fine. Maybe he'll be back here in a few days even worse for wear because you rushed him out. Who knows? But, darn it all, though, if what I don't think is the bigger question, is why you even give a hoot?
10470	Carla	Well, actually, sir, I have this little problem with caring for my patients.
10471	Dr. Kelso	Still, if you decide later that what you really care about is how much your patients like you, you can always change your mind about letting Mr. Woodbury leave. Hell, I'll even back you up.
10472	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
10473	Turk	Apologize.
10474	J.D.	Apologize to you?
10475	Turk	No. To Richard that was his basketball.
10476	J.D.	Hello, Richard. I'll tell you what: Tomorrow, at lunch, I'll I'll I'll bring you a new basketball.... And a hoagie.
10477	Turk	What's up? This is about Elliot? Don't you want to hear my side of the story with your little sex buddy?
10478	J.D.	No.
10479	Turk	Come on, man, where's the love? Where's the where's the loyalty? Where's the automatically siding with the person you care about the most?
10480	Turk	Oh, my God, that's what you're doing, isn't it. Isn't it?
10481	J.D.'s Narration	Some realizations stop you in your tracks. Others can lead you in new directions.
10482	Elliot	Dr. Cox. I just wanted to let you know that Turk did the right thing by taking my patients off of my service.
10483	Dr. Cox	Noooo. What that yellow-bellied scalpel jock should have done was to go down to Surgery and schedule himself for an early morning add-a-pair-tomy. That way, if it took, he'd have the stones to at least come and talk to you next time he had a problem.
10484	Elliot	I just can't seem to stop letting my life out there affect my life in here, you know?
10485	Dr. Cox	Well, hell, Barbie...look at me. It's not like I've always been the centered, well-adjusted guy-smiley you see walking up and down the halls of this dump; I mean, stuff like that takes time. But, eventually, you learn to keep your personal problems separate from this place.
10486	Elliot	So, what do I do until then?
10487	Dr. Cox	You get your damn life in order.
10488	Dr. Cox	Oh, and, Barbie? Let's say word were to get out that Uncle Cox was doling out the feel goods? I'll make ya pay ya have no idea. Huge!
10489	J.D.'s Narration	It's a funny thing when we're forced to see ourselves in a new light.
10490	Carla	Mr. Woodbury! Hold on a sec!
10491	J.D.'s Narration	Hopefully, you see yourself in time to make a change.
10492	Carla	Unfortunately, we're not comfortable discharging you just yet. I'm really, really sorry.
10493	J.D.'s Narration	And hopefully you'll be respected for it.
10494	Mr. Woodbury	You evil little witch!
10495	Dr. Kelso	Let me see that chart, Nurse!
10496	Dr. Kelso	Well! I see no reason we should keep Mr. Woodbury any longer! Enjoy your son's wedding, sir! Cherish the moment!
10497	Mr. Woodbury	Thank you so much, Dr.....?
10498	Dr. Kelso	Kelso! Bob Kelso!
10499	Mr. Woodbury	Bye, Bob!
10500	Dr. Kelso	Glad I could help.
10501	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, sometimes, the new light opens your eyes to something you've known in your heart all along.

10504	Elliot	What's all this?
10505	J.D.	Nothing.... I just felt like taking care of you.
10506	Elliot	That is so nice!
10507	J.D.'s Thoughts	It's nice because it's the beginning of something.
10508	Elliot	I.... I can't do this.
10509	J.D.	Okay, less tongue, less tongue.
10510	Elliot	No, this. You know sex buddies.
10511	Elliot	J.D., Dr. Cox and I were talking, and my life is just so scattered right now. And I just...I just can't seem to grab a toe-hold, you know? And...I know myself, and if we keep doing this, I'm not gonna be able to separate the sex from my feelings. And we'll just end up being a couple again. And...neither one of us wants that, right?
10512	Elliot	I mean, I know I don't.
10513	J.D.	Me neither.
10514	Elliot	So, what do we do?
10515	J.D.	Uh.... It's it's no big deal. You you get your stuff out of my room, and you crash on the couch.

10519	J.D.	Hey, you're black, right?
10520	Turk	Here we go.
10521	J.D.	I hate that stereotype that all black people yell at movie screens. You know? Like, you go see some horror flick, and you be yelling, like, "Don't go in there, girl, he behind the doh'!" You know? It's like...it's offensive.
10522	Turk	You wish you were allowed to yell at the screen, don't you!
10523	J.D.	Why does she go in there!? I mean, he's behind the doh'!
10524	J.D.'s Narration	It's weird to run into someone from the hospital out in the real world.
10525	J.D.	Oh, hey, Dr. Kelso.
10526	Turk	How...how ya doin', sir?
10527	Dr. Kelso	I'm just Jim Dandy. Now, unless your pants are made out of Turtle Wax, I suggest you boys get your asses off of Bessy.
10528	J.D.	Oh, I'm sorr You named your car, huh?
10529	J.D.'s Narration	Ultimately, life is a lot simpler at home.
10530	J.D.'s Narration	Unless you live with a co-worker you're crazy about, and she recently decided she can't handle sleeping with you, and she just wants to be friends.
10531	Elliot	Oh...right. Morning, buddy!
10532	J.D.	Morning, pal.
10533	Elliot	I'll just go get dressed...and then, uh, we can go to work.
10534	J.D.'s Thoughts	All right, just relax. You can totally handle this.
10535	J.D.	Chop Chop-chop, buddy!
10536	Elliot	Told you I could fit in this spot!
10537	J.D.	You were right. I'll just...put this guy's side-view mirror on his roof.
10538	J.D.	Argh.
10539	Elliot	Hey, J.D.
10540	J.D.	Ooh!
10541	J.D.	Yes?
10542	Elliot	I wanted to say something, you know, before we go back in there.
10543	J.D.	G'head.
10544	Elliot	That I understand that it's gonna be a little bit harder for you to transition into being just friends again.
10545	J.D.	Why?
10546	Elliot	Because...you're a guy?
10547	J.D.	What does that have to do with anything?
10548	Elliot	You're right. You know what we should do? Everything I own is in the back of this truck including my bed. We should just get in there, get naked, and have sex one last time just get it out of our system.
10549	Elliot	J.D., I was kidding to prove a point.

10557	Nurse Roberts	_I_ feel weird.
10558	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, just tell her the truth you're crazy about her.
10559	J.D.	Look, Elliot
10560	Dr. Cox	Ahhh, damn. I missed the annual sleep-over, didn't I? That _wonderful_ time of year when you two crazy kids throw caution to the wind and make sweet, elbowy love to each other. Don't you be shy! You can tell Uncle Coxie about the naught-aye!
10561	Elliot	Dr. Cox, I lost my apartment, and so I was just...needing a place to stay.
10562	Dr. Cox	So, you went over to your "friend's" house, and cried on his shoulder boo-hoo, wah and you, of course, comforted her because she was weak and vulnerable, and blah...blah...blah...nerdy sex. The end. Dear Lord, Laverne, how in God's name do you listen to this crap all day long?
10563	Nurse Roberts	Are you kidding? If he turns out to be her brother, this is better than my stories!
10564	Dr. Cox	Oh, you are _so_ right!
10565	Todd	Dude. What are her boobs like?
10566	Elliot	Todd, I'm standing right here.
10567	Todd	I'm sorry. What are your boobs like?
10568	Dr. Cox	Oh, joy of joys Mr. Corman, you've joined us yet again. And what imaginary disease is ailing you this time, my good man?
10569	Carla	This time he thinks he has the Yaba virus.
10570	Mr. Corman	Your hair got longer.... And I don't appreciate your tone.
10571	Dr. Cox	Last month, you thought you had familial Mediterranean fever.
10572	Mr. Corman	I was at my friend Kelly Papadopoulos' wedding, okay? I share a glass of ouzo with this guy named Yanos. Twenty minutes later, I'm in a cab, I gotta ask the guy to pull over because I'm gonna explode in some guy's rose garden! Now, what would _you_ think!?
10573	Dr. Cox	Same thing I think right now: That you got yourself a bad case of the wish-you-were-sicks.
10574	Mr. Corman	Yeah, well I read the symptoms on the internet, okay? I have Yaba!
10575	Dr. Cox	Would you say you've been in contact with many exotic primates this year?
10576	Mr. Corman	I have been to the zoo, yes.
10577	Dr. Cox	And, while you were there, did you go ahead and jump right into the cage and play toss the poop with the other monkeys? Because, if you did, then yeah, you just might have Yaba. But, if that's the case, it would be way, way down on the list of your problems.
10578	Dr. Cox	Give him a full work-up.
10579	Carla	Okay, Mr. Corman, you know the drill.
10580	Mr. Corman	Here are my vitals.

10588	Turk	Brain!
10589	Dr. Kelso	...brain.
10590	Turk	Mrs. Kay is doing great, sir. But, after this type of procedure, most people experience a diminished reaction time.
10591	Mrs. Kay	Christopher, come here.
10592	Turk	Hm?
10593	Mrs. Kay	Maybe you should worry about your _own_ reaction time.
10594	Dr. Kelso	Now, do you have a ride home today, dear?
10595	Mrs. Kay	I drove myself.
10596	Dr. Kelso	Well, it always warms my heart to see your face.
10597	Dr. Kelso	I don't care what the old bat says I doubt she can back out of her own driveway. Tell her you're calling the DMV and having her license revoked immediately.
10598	Turk	Why don't you tell her yourself, sir?
10599	Dr. Kelso	'Cause she's my friend! Don't be insensitive, son, it's ugly on you.
10600	Turk	You guys, I can't take this sweet old lady's driver's license from her she reminds me of my Gram-Gram.

10611	Carla	Turk! Elliot's right here!
10612	Elliot	Why would I care?
10613	Carla	I'm sorry. I guess, when I was passing by J.D.'s room the other night, he was telling a _different_ Dr. Reid not to stop.
10614	Turk	"Ohh! Dr. Reid!" Sweet!
10615	J.D.	You guys, this conversation is starting to make me feel a little uncomfortable, okay? And I'm sure "Dr. Reid" feels the same way.
10616	Elliot	No I don't. You can "ehn-ehn" with anyone that you want.
10617	J.D.'s Thoughts	So, she wants to play Chicken, huh? Well, buckle up, missy!
10618	J.D.	Well, maybe I'll just ask Lisa out again.
10619	Elliot	You should.
10620	J.D.	Maybe I will!
10621	Elliot	Cool.
10622	J.D.	Good.
10623	Elliot	Take it home.
10624	J.D.	That's what I'll do.
10625	Elliot	Let me know how it goes.
10626	Lisa	Fine. But I am taking my own car so I can escape in case you turn into a freak again.
10627	J.D.	It's a date!

10629	Dr. Cox	It's just that the guy's here like a thousand times a year, taking up a bed. And every second I'm in there with him, it's time away from somebody I could actually help.
10630	Carla	Well, what do you want me to do about it?
10631	Dr. Cox	Follow my lead.
10632	Dr. Cox	Alas, Mr. Corman, shockingly, all your labs have come back and they're negative for...everything.
10633	Mr. Corman	Aw, come on!
10634	Dr. Cox	Okay, I'll tell you what: You have suggested that you're feeling rather tired lately, haven't you.
10635	Mr. Corman	I'm listening.
10636	Dr. Cox	And that you bruise easily?
10637	Mr. Corman	Like an old banana.
10638	Dr. Cox	For the record, I think you're fine. But, if you'd like, we can go ahead and check out your bone marrow. Of course, that would mean sticking an enormous needle all the way through your hip and it's very, very, very, very excruciatingly painful. Right, Carla?
10639	Carla	Yes.
10640	Dr. Cox	Thank you, Carla. Now, what's it gonna be, there, champ? Head home and get some rest, or an afternoon of senseless, mind-numbing..._agony_?
10641	Mr. Corman	Eh, what the hell. I'll take the giant hip needle.
10642	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
10643	J.D.'s Thoughts	All right, there's no one around. Time to tell her how you really feel.
10644	J.D.	You know, Elliot....
10645	Todd	What's up, Medical Dogs!
10646	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, you're smarter than him. Think of something clever to get him out of here.
10647	J.D.	Hey, Todd.
10648	Todd	What the hell? Did you just throw something out into the hall?
10649	J.D.	So, anyway, Elliot....
10650	Elliot	Hey, I found an apartment!
10651	J.D.	Great! ...You know, but there's no rush for you to move out.
10652	Elliot	Well, what are we gonna do, just live with each other forever, and anytime we feel, like, lonely or vulnerable, we just hop into bed and have hot sex?
10653	J.D.	That would be stupid.
10654	Elliot	We're both human, so, staying in that situation would be a big mistake.
10655	J.D.	I know.

10660	J.D.	I thought so.
10661	Janitor	Actually, I'm going to speak at my son's career day.
10662	J.D.	About...being a janitor?
10663	Janitor	What do you think, there aren't kids out there that want to grow up to make the world sparkle?
10664	J.D.	I I didn't mean it that way, I just....
10665	Janitor	How did you mean it?

10671	Turk	Brain!
10672	Dr. Kelso	Dammit. Why do I keep blanking on that? Now, son, give me the real skinny did you pull her license or not?
10673	Turk	Yes, sir, I did.

10679	Carla	Dr. Cox, I think you should take a look at, um, Mr. Corman's chart.
10680	Dr. Cox	Why, what's he got, scurvy? Mr. Corman? There's no chance you were on a ship in the 1700s, is there?
10681	Carla	Just look at the damn chart.
10682	Mr. Corman	What is it?
10683	Dr. Cox	You're sick.

10689	Elliot	My truck was right there.
10690	J.D.	Where is it now?
10691	Elliot	You have to ask the guy who stole it. Everything I own was in that truck.
10692	Elliot	J.D., I don't know what I'm gonna do!
10693	J.D.	Wow.

10700	Turk	You do.
10701	J.D.	Yeah, well, I've had Malik since I was seventeen; that's totally different. Don't worry about Kelso, his wife can drive him.

10707	Mr. Corman	Yeah.... I think I had that in college once.
10708	Dr. Cox	This is Dr. Zeltzer. He is the finest oncologist we have on staff.
10709	Dr. Zeltzer	Really? You think so?
10710	Dr. Cox	Yeah, I do.
10711	Dr. Zeltzer	Thank you!
10712	Mr. Corman	So, where do we start?
10713	Dr. Zeltzer	Well, uh, first off, we need to Better than Leventhal?
10714	Mr. Corman	Leventhal's a quack. You're the guy. You're the man. You can do it!
10715	Dr. Zeltzer	Bless you.
10716	Dr. Zeltzer	That was some catch. The patient shows almost no symptoms, you call for a bone marrow biopsy? What made you even think to do that?
10717	Dr. Cox	How about, he was unbelievably annoying, and I wanted to scare him so bad that he'd never come back in my hospital again?

10719	Carla	Oh! Don't worry, Dr. Zeltzer, he's only kidding!

10733	Nurse Roberts	Could you speak up? Mr. Roberts doesn't hear so well.
10734	Elliot	Laverne, if you're looking for your beeswax, none of that is over here, okay?!
10735	Nurse Roberts	Now she all mad.
10736	Elliot	Look, I really just needed your help last night, and you completely bailed on me.
10737	J.D.	You're the one that drew all these lines up, said that we're not in a relationship right now.
10738	Elliot	J.D., I wasn't looking for a boyfriend last night I was looking for a friend.
10739	Nurse Roberts	Guess she told him.
10740	Nurse Roberts	Gotta go.
10741	J.D.	Ow.
10742	Janitor	I was just thinkin' about what you said, and, uh, you're right buncha kids don't want to hear about being a janitor.
10743	J.D.	I never said that.
10744	Janitor	It's okay. 'Cause, instead, I'm gonna be a doctor. I borrowed some stuff from your locker _our_ locker and, um...listen, if I don't get it back to you within, like, two days...consider it gone.

10748	Dr. Kelso	Son, have you used drugs in the last forty-eight hours?
10749	Patient	Oh, no, sir. Never use drugs.
10750	Dr. Kelso	Because this shot you're about to get could kill you if it's mixed with narcotics.
10751	Patient	Oh, drugs! Yes, sir, all the time!
10752	Dr. Kelso	See? Waiting for the tox-screen six hours. Frightening the bejeebies out of the local riff-raff ten seconds. Everybody lies, Dr. Turk. Whether it's that doobie brother in there, or, say, me when I tell my son he can still live at the house after he graduates from art school. And, by the way, sport: Mrs. Kay doesn't _have_ any grandchildren.

10762	Dr. Cox	Yeah, it is!
10763	Mr. Corman	But you know what? You guys can pat yourself on the back all you want, but I'm not an idiot. I know that you were screwing with me; that I come in here sometimes, thinking I'm sick when I'm not. But if you remember anything, you remember this: If it turns out I didn't have cancer, I coulda been just some guy coming in here, looking for help...that you treated like crap.
10764	Dr. Cox	Yeah.
10765	Mr. Corman	The whole thing has given me an ulcer.

10781	Dr. Cox	Sh'yeah! Lookit, whenever I'm about to do some stupid-ass stuff, you're the one who calls me on it, and you're then damn-sure the one who makes me stop. That's the way it works. That's the way it's worked for years, and.... Just exactly what happened to that?
10782	Carla	I guess I just don't get as good a read on you as I used to. ...Maybe all that therapy _has_ changed you?
10783	Dr. Cox	Oh, please, I'm crazier than ever. Lookit, during this entire conversation, I've actually been imagining myself sitting on a throne between us, watching all of this.
10784	Carla	Maybe we're just not as close as we used to be.

10800	J.D.	Okay, maybe you're right. But, we're doctors, man. I mean, that comes with the territory; some patients just don't like telling the whole truth.
10801	Turk	Well, I don't get why people have to do that.

10920	J.D.	See? We don't always have to be like, "Bluh-bluh-bluh-bluh." We could be like, "Hey! How ya doin'! I'm good, thanks!" This can work, you know? We can can be there for each other.
10921	Janitor	It's just a pen, Scooter, not a kidney.
10922	Janitor	Thanks.
10923	J.D.	No. You keep it.
10924	Janitor	Really?
10925	Janitor	Makes me look smarter. Yeah. Off to scrub the crappers.

10927	Dr. Cox	So, here's the deal Mrs. Larkin: You have a valvular defect in your heart.
10928	Mr. Larkin	Oh, God!
10929	Mrs. Larkin	Relax, Steve. He's a worrier.
10930	J.D.	Me too. I'm a worrier.
10931	Dr. Cox	The thing is
10932	Mr. Larkin	Ah, here it comes.
10933	Dr. Cox	The thing is that pregnancy puts such an extra strain on your heart that, had we known about this condition beforehand, we would have strongly suggested you think twice about even getting pregnant before getting the valve repaired.
10934	Mrs. Larkin	I would've done it anyways!
10935	Dr. Cox	Yeah, you would've. You got a healthy supply of pluck about you, don't ya.
10936	Mr. Larkin	I can't breathe!
10937	Mrs. Larkin	You're okay. Let's do this!
10938	Dr. Cox	Love the pluck.

10944	Turk	You've had six bran muffins, Ralphie; how is it that you don't have to go yet?
10945	Carla	Turk? I still have to pack tonight. Are you sure you want to have dinner?
10946	Turk	I am positive.
10947	Carla	Okay.
10948	Turk	Okay?
10949	Carla	See you later.
10950	Turk	All right.
10951	Carla	Hey, cutie!
10952	Turk	All right, Ralphie, new tack: I want you to do what I do, okay? I want you to imagine that there are tiny men inside your booty, trying to push the dookie. Push the dookie out, Ralphie! Can you imagine that for me?
10953	Ralphie's Dad	You told my son there were little men inside him?! He barely sleeps as it is!
10954	Turk	Sir, I'm sorry, I was wrong.
10955	Ralphie's Dad	That was sick!
10956	Turk	But still, if you could do this for me, I would greatly appreciate it: The next time your son has a bowel movement, take the dookie, put it in a ziplock bag, and just call me on my cell phone.
10957	Turk	...It's for my girlfriend.
10958	Turk	Hey, Ralphie! Little men! Pushin' it out! Pushin' it out!

10960	J.D.	That Mrs. Larkin's an aggressive lady. She wouldn't even let her husband finish a sentence
10961	Dr. Cox	Oh, shut the hell up, would you please? At least she's ballsy, unlike that husband who's the overly thoughtful, sensitive type that drive me crazy.
10962	Dr. Cox	What?
10963	J.D.	Nah, I just, I think the Larkins compliment each other they're a good team. Kinda remind me of us.
10964	Dr. Cox	Roseanne, now, granted, I was as usual only halfway listening to you, but I got the sinking feeling you just compared us to a married couple. I know, I know, a girl can dream, but...this is never gonna happen. Get in here!
10965	Nurse Roberts	She went into atrial fibrillation.
10966	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
10967	Dr. Cox	Newbie, call an OB-GYN for an emergency consult and notify the NICU.
10968	Mr. Larkin	What the hell is going on?
10969	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes it's hard to find the right words.
10970	Dr. Kelso	Once I knock down this wall, right here, I'm going to have more room than I know what to do with!
10971	Lawyer	Sir, I'm so happy for you I could crap.
10972	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes, words come easy.
10973	Elliot	Dr. Kelso, I _demand_ a female locker room.
10974	Carla	I loved it, but, why spend all this money on this fancy dinner?
10975	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes, the words don't come out at all.
10976	Turk	No reason.
10977	J.D.'s Narration	But, ultimately, you have to grit your teeth and just say it.
10978	Dr. Cox	We don't deliver this baby, your wife could die.
10979	J.D.'s Narration	You see, as a doctor, you get used to the whole balance in the hospital thing. You know, when one person lives, another dies, and how it always seems to even out...
10980	Mr. Larkin	But it's so soon! You said so, yourself. What's gonna happen to the baby?
10981	Dr. Cox	We're gonna do our best.
10982	J.D.'s Narration	...but it never seems fair when it happens in the same family.
10983	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
10984	Mr. Larkin	So, you're telling me if we don't deliver the baby now, my wife could die. And if we do, our child probably won't live.
10985	J.D.'s Thoughts	Sometimes, as a doctor, I wish my life was more like my favorite TV show.
10986	***Fantasy Sequence	The scene is the same, but J.D. suddenly gets a stupid smile on his face as he speaks to Mr. Larkin.
10987	J.D.	Oh, come on, death isn't that bad. Especially if you're dying from laughter you're on 'Candid Camera'!
10988	Mr. Larkin	No, I'm not!
10989	Mr. Larkin	Honey no!
10990	Dr. Cox	Oh, I'll give you "honey, no"s! Come on out here!
10991	Mr. Larkin	Where are the cameras?!
10992	J.D.	We got ya! A camera there, there, and there!
10993	Dr. Cox	Mr. Larkin, we need a decision from you, here.
10994	Mr. Larkin	I'm not ready to do this.
10995	Dr. Cox	You go, I'll cover her.

10997	Elliot	Dr. Kelso, I am not leaving here until I get an answer.
10998	Dr. Kelso	Sweetheart, there are lots of people who think the hospital would be a better place if we made some changes. Take Ted, for instance!
10999	Lawyer	Uhh.... I feel I'd be more productive if my phone dialed out.
11000	Dr. Kelso	This hospital has always had a co-ed locker room. Ahhh, back when I was a resident, I remember blah-blah-blah, nostalgic story. Now get the hell out of my office!
11001	Dr. Kelso	Not you, Ted.
11002	Dr. Kelso	Ted, get the hell out of my office!
11003	Lawyer	Oh, thank God.

11008	Turk	Baby, don't go.
11009	J.D.	Have you seen Mr. Larkin?
11010	Carla	Uh, no.
11011	Janitor	Thanks for the pen.
11012	J.D.	Oh, no.
11013	Janitor	Yeah.
11014	Janitor	That's my favorite t-shirt.
11015	Janitor	And this...my favorite skin!
11016	J.D.	Well, you know that I would never mean for that to happen. You know that, right?
11017	Janitor	Yeah! I know that.
11018	J.D.	Okay, this is a little cozy for me.
11019	Janitor	Is it?
11020	Mr. Larkin	I don't think you people are getting how difficult this is.
11021	J.D.	Trust me, I wouldn't want to have to make this decision.
11022	Mr. Larkin	I wish I could ask my wife. She'd be better at handling this than me.
11023	J.D.	You know, you and I are a lot alike. We may seem like the kind of guy you can just, you know, throw in a head-lock and draw a mustache on...but, in crunch time, we always come through.
11024	J.D.	It's time. Come on.

11026	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Reid, are you off for the day?
11027	Elliot	Oh! I just didn't have a place to change....
11028	Nurse Roberts	Mm-hmm.
11029	Dr. Kelso	Laverne, I'm going to pretend you're not wearing that.
11030	Nurse Roberts	Don't you usually wait 'till you get home before you do that?
11031	Elliot	Plus, according to county statue, all medical facilities in this region are required to provide single-sex bathrooms and change-rooms for their employees. Put that in your suggestion box and smoke it!
11032	Dr. Kelso	Dammit. Where'd she learn all that legal mumbo-jumbo?
11033	Dr. Kelso	What are you doing, Ted!?
11034	Lawyer	I'm trying to whistle...? You know, so you wouldn't think it was me.

11038	Old Lady	Take it.
11039	Turk	Sorry, ma'am. My bad.
11040	Carla	What is going on?
11041	Turk	I gotta ask you something before you go.
11042	Carla	What?
11043	Mr. Larkin	You're doing great. You're gonna be fine.
11044	Dr. Cox	Nice job, Newbie. That's a real nice job. What we gotta do now is cross our fingers.
11045	J.D.'s Narration	Death is always hanging around this hospital.
11046	***Fantasy Shot	J.D. looks over at the Nurses' Station, where the Grim Reaper stands behind a few staffers, a cup of coffee in hand.
11047	Death	Morning.
11048	J.D.'s Narration	Ultimately, it all boils down to what your attitude is about it.
11049	Elaine	I'm not afraid of death. I mean, if I got a heart, that would be great. Still, if they told me it was never gonna happen, I think that'd be okay, too. It's the _waiting_ I can't take. I just wanna know one way or the other, you know?
11050	Dr. Cox	I got an idea: Why don't we switch to a cheerier subject!
11051	J.D.	What do you think death is like?
11052	Elaine	I really hope it's like a big Broadway musical. Everyone's all dressed up and singing to the rafters, and you go out with a real flourish.
11053	J.D.	I think it's like a game of dodge-ball.
11054	J.D.	There's a lot of chaos and screaming, and...you know...eventually you get your glasses snapped in half by the big kid who already has underarm hair. But then you wake up in the hot nurse's office, and when she leans in to put that bandage on your nose, you get a sense that something could actually happen if you just took a chance and buried your face in her knockers.
11055	Dr. Cox	Holy cow. I'm so sorry. I guess, for my part, I think death is a lot like that story, quite frankly. But, if there is a God, it'll be a lot quicker and half as painful.
11056	Elaine	It's fun to annoy him!
11057	J.D.	It's what I do.
11058	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11059	Lawyer	So, I hear they're making that office into the ladies' locker room, huh?
11060	Dr. Kelso	Yes, Ted.
11061	Lawyer	Bummer!
11062	Lawyer	We hey, maybe whoever's over here might not stay there forever!
11063	Doctor	Well, I'm here doing a research fellowship, so I'll be anywhere from fifteen to twenty-five years!
11064	Lawyer	That's a long time.
11065	Doctor	Yeah!
11066	Lawyer	You'll probably be dead!

11071	Turk	I'm talkin' here!
11072	Carla	Turk, I'm I'm gonna miss my flight. I gotta go, Honey, I'm sorry.
11073	Turk	Will you marry me?
11074	Carla	What did you say?
11075	Turk	I think I said, Will you marry me?
11076	Carla	Turk, wow!
11077	Turk	I got a ring. Um.... I don't have it on me, but, uh...it's in a safe place.
11078	Carla	I can't believe this! I I've imagined you saying this to me like a thousand times.... I just never imagined that when you actually asked, all I would say is...I need to think.
11079	Turk	Cool! Uh.... Yeah, whew! That's that's that's that's what I was hoping to hear!
11080	Carla	I love you. I really do.

11085	J.D.	Congratulations, you guys. He's doing great.
11086	J.D.'s Thoughts	I guess sometimes my whole theory about life and death balancing each other out in the hospital doesn't hold true. I guess sometimes you get lucky.

11112	J.D.	All right, man. I understand.
11113	J.D.	Still nothing?!
11114	Turk	We just keep missing each other. I'm not sweating it.
11115	Turk	She asked me to pick her up from the airport! That's a good sign, right!
11116	J.D.	Good sign? Dude, I am so sure Carla's gonna say yes, if she doesn't I'll power-walk naked through these halls singing "Me and Bobby McGee"!
11117	Dr. Kelso	Ahhh, Janis Joplin! My God, she was an uggo! No offense, sport uh, don't think I have anything against ugly people.
11118	J.D.	Why would I take offense to that?
11119	Dr. Kelso	No reason. Anyway, I see you're on the nephrology service for Dr. Townshend this month!
11120	J.D.'s Narration	Dr. Townshend is like the Anti-Kelso.

11137	Dr. Townshend	Missed you on our morning jog, Bobby. What is that now, about two hundred days in a row?
11138	Dr. Kelso	You're a pistol!

11146	Carla	I want to thank you for not pressuring me. I mean, don't get me wrong, you left me like forty messages in five days; but...I know you if you weren't holding back, it woulda been like a hundred and forty.

11173	Turk	No, Kevin, that's not gonna work.
11174	Kevin	Well, I'm a business man we can work something out. Let me see, I sent you to college, and med school, and you have done nothing for me; so, I tell you what: I'll sleep on the couch, and you cut me a check for eighty grand.
11175	Turk	I'll go get my pillow.
11176	Kevin	Yeah.
11177	J.D.	That was good, Kevin! We should we should make him, like, make dinner for us tonight. He could be our own personal slave!

11190	Dr. Cox	Now, Bar-bie, Jordan is here for her ultrasound today, and I'm going to be holding her claw the entire time. So, what you've just done is essentially volunteered to do all of your work and all of mine. And if you'll step right this way, I'll be more than glad to tell you more about what you've won!
11191	Dr. Townshend	See you at lunch, Bobby?
11192	Dr. Kelso	Split-pea soup today!
11193	Dr. Townshend	Oh!
11194	J.D.	You know, sir, Dr. Townshend, here, was telling me you have some great old stories about the hospital. I...I'd love to hear one sometime.

11224	Dr. Cox	Jordan, be reasonable. If you're incubating some kind of man-bat in there, we should find out about it as soon as possible there are vaccinations to consider.
11225	Jordan	Tell you what, we'll compromise. I'll decide this, and you get to decide...um.... Sorry, I got nothing.
11226	Dr. Gerson	Look, it's common for each parent to feel differently.
11227	Dr. Cox	Actually, I am not the father; he's a bell-boy in Greece.
11228	Jordan	We think.
11229	Dr. Gerson	Neat.
11230	Jordan	It's kicking me.
11231	Dr. Cox	Who could blame the poor thing.
11232	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11233	J.D.'s Thoughts	Huh. That's odd.
11234	Janitor	What the hell just happened?
11235	J.D.	I moved your ladder.
11236	Janitor	I don't know...why you keep doing these things to me!
11237	J.D.	I don't know, either!
11238	Dr. Townshend	Well, if it isn't my favorite custodial engineer! Listen, do me a favor, will you?
11239	Janitor	Yeah?
11240	Dr. Townshend	Help me look after this kid one of the good guys.
11241	Kevin	So, look, Chris, I got a meeting this afternoon...but what do you say tonight, me and you tear it up like we used to!
11242	Turk	I gotta work.
11243	Kevin	Well, get somebody to cover for your ass, man! I'm only here for the weekend!
11244	Turk	Look, I _just_ asked Carla to marry me, and you were in there acting like a jerk.
11245	Kevin	Oh, man! You you you're engaged!? Congratulations!
11246	Turk	She hasn't exactly said yes yet.
11247	Kevin	Well, that that that that's all right. Sometimes a lady just needs to sleep on it.
11248	Turk	I asked her a week ago.
11249	Kevin	Damn!
11250	Turk	Yeah.
11251	Kevin	Well, on the bright side, you are definitely flying solo tonight, huh!
11252	Turk	I'm out.
11253	Kevin	Hey, Chris, come on now I was just playing.
11254	Kevin	CHRIS!

11256	Dr. Gerson	If you really don't want to know the sex, it's time to look away.
11257	Elliot	Dr. Cox, I excuse me um, I just need you
11258	Dr. Cox	Ah-ba-ba-ba.
11259	Dr. Cox	You know, Jordan, this is ridiculous; I'm gonna find out the sex of the baby
11260	Jordan	Yeah, Dr. Gerson's not gonna tell you.
11261	Elliot	Oh, look!
11262	Dr. Cox	Oh, gosh...I guess I'm stuck, then. All righty.
11263	He mouths	"We'll talk later."
11264	Dr. Cox	Go!
11265	Dr. Cox	Out! Chop-chop! Whoa!

11267	J.D.	Sir, can I call you "Townsie"?
11268	Dr. Townshend	No.
11269	J.D.'s Narration	I was having a great time working with Townsie.
11270	Dr. Townshend	Now, Mr. Singer, here, needs a swan. So, why don't you go ahead and do an IJ cut down?
11271	J.D.'s Thoughts	A _cut down_? No one does those anymore.
11272	J.D.	Uh, sir, shouldn't I just do a modified Seldinger? I mean, it's so much safer.
11273	Dr. Townshend	Nah, come on, let's do "old school."
11274	J.D.	But, sir, I don't
11275	Dr. Townshend	Grab a scalpel; I'll get the kit.
11276	Dr. Townshend	Somebody?
11277	J.D.'s Narration	So often in a hospital, you feel like you're alone on an island. Whether it's because you just can't bring yourself to make a really important decision...
11278	Shot of	Carla looking at her ring.
11279	J.D.'s Narration	Or because you're waiting for an answer...
11280	Shot of	Turk lost in thought.
11281	J.D.'s Narration	Or simply because you know a secret you wish you didn't.
11282	Shot of	Elliot nervously passing a hopeful Cox.
11283	J.D.'s Narration	For me, I was stuck on that island because somebody else put me there.
11284	Dr. Townshend	Okay, come on now, just cut through.... Good. Now, open up the vein.... But be careful not to nick the carotid artery.
11285	Dr. Townshend	Oh, boy.
11286	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, no.
11287	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11288	Todd	The vascular surgeon on call said to say you could pick up your patient this evening. He also said to say he could give you a loaner patient if you needed someone to butcher until then.... But I didn't really get it.
11289	Dr. Townshend	No one expects you to, son.
11290	Todd	Okay, thanks.
11291	J.D.'s Thoughts	All right, this sucks. But, as bad as I feel, I'm sure Dr. Townshend feels even worse for making me do the procedure.
11292	Dr. Townshend	Don't worry about it I'll take the blame, okay?
11293	J.D.'s Thoughts	He hides it well.
11294	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11295	Carla	Do you really think he wants to get married?
11296	Dr. Cox	Listen, any guy who'd be willing to scour the face of the earth to find the world's smallest diamond ring clearly knows just exactly what he wants.
11297	Carla	I just don't know if he's mature enough. I mean, he couldn't stop giggling when he found out he had to operate on Mr. Wiener.
11298	Dr. Cox	It's a funny name!
11299	Carla	Stop it.
11300	Dr. Cox	Look: The guy's twenty-seven years old, he's a surgeon currently involved in a long-term monogamous relationship; and as much as I'd love to trash him, I'm afraid I'm not down with the whole maturity thing.
11301	Dr. Cox	Barbie!
11302	Dr. Cox	Barbie, lookit, I need you to go down to the lab and get Mrs. Miller's blood-work; I also need you to disimpact Mr. Burnett in 317; and what did you say the sex of the child was?
11303	Elliot	I've got a better idea: You do those things, and when you're done, I'll think about telling you the sex.
11304	Dr. Cox	Huh, that's weird. It seems like you just went to a swap meet and got yourself a big-boy spine. Now, listen, you tell or else!
11305	Elliot	Or else what? You'll treat me worse than you usually do? Here's the inside scoop, Perry: For the first time, I have leverage. You're familiar with leverage, right? It's what you're going to need when you disimpact Mr. Burnett who, by the way, is so locked up, I'm guessing he's been eating either gum, rubber cement, or cork.
11306	Dr. Cox	Look. Barbie.
11307	Elliot	Yeah...that's not my name.
11308	Dr. Cox	Fine.... Dr......Reid? Really?
11309	Elliot	What?
11310	Dr. Cox	Nothing.
11311	Elliot	Elliot Reid in the house!

11313	Janitor	Sit.
11314	J.D.	Oh, no thanks... I'll just go
11315	Janitor	I'm not asking.
11316	Janitor	All right, guys, this is the kid I was telling you about we're gonna look out for.
11317	Janitor	This is Brent from Parking. He's gonna set you up with a sweet spot right at the main entrance so you'll never be late again. This is Crazy-Eyes Margot, from Housekeeping. She's gonna make sure that you got freshly-pressed scrubs in your locker every morning. 'Course, this is Troy, you know him from the cafeteria line. He's gonna stop spitting in your food.
11318	J.D.	Thank you...for that.
11319	Troy	I still don't understand...why we got to be nice to this pal.
11320	Janitor	'Cause I said so.
11321	Troy	Yeah, but!
11322	Janitor	Troy! No more warnings.
11323	Janitor	Whoa! Bring the hands in.
11324	Janitor	Bless us, O Lord, in these thy gifts which we are about to receive from thy bounty. Through Christ our Lord, Amen. Look out for each and every one of us, including our new member. Also...help Margot to find her way home tonight.
11325	J.D.'s Narration	Still...something was bothering me.
11326	Dr. Townshend	Bob, come on, how many more times are you gonna make me apologize for introducing you to your wife?
11327	Dr. Kelso	Once a month, until she's dead!
11328	J.D.	Excuse me, sir, do you have a second?
11329	Dr. Kelso	Sport, what did I tell you about my open-door policy? I don't have one.
11330	J.D.	Dr. Kelso, I was the one who nicked the artery on Mr. Singer.
11331	Dr. Townshend	Oh, cheese on rice, son! I just said it was me!
11332	Dr. Kelso	You need to shape up, son. Lord knows you're never gonna get by on your looks.
11333	J.D.	All right, first of all, at the very least I'm interesting looking; all right? And secondly, I...feel I made that mistake because Dr. Townshend forced me to perform a procedure that is unsafe and...outdated.
11334	J.D.'s Thoughts	Sorry, Townsie.
11335	Dr. Kelso	Now, let me get this straight: You screwed up doing something you should've been able to handle, and now you're in here to tattle on the very guy who's taken the bullet for you. Is that right?
11336	Dr. Townshend	Do me a favor, will ya, son? Grab that for me?
11337	Dr. Townshend	Thanks!
11338	J.D.	I'm sorry, sir.

11344	Turk	No, sir. I call everyone..."Rowdy."
11345	Kevin	What did you want me to do? Leave him in the car?
11346	Turk	It's bad enough you freaked out my girlfriend, but now you wanna get me fired! Why don't you just smack me in my face?
11347	Kevin	Fine. Hey, check this out!
11348	Kevin	I can't believe that you're giving me attitude. I've taken care of you your entire life, and I come here and I tell you that I'm getting divorced, and you make it all about you!
11349	Turk	Well, you didn't seem too broken up about it, Kevin! Why should I care?
11350	Kevin	She left me, okay?
11351	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11352	Dr. Cox	All righty, there, Dr. Leverage. Listen up, because here's the real 'inside scoop': I could literally sculpt a gigantic Mr. Burnett out of what I just removed _from_ Mr. Burnett. So, I really think it's in your best interest for you to start talking. Should I get the child a baseball glove or a tutu?
11353	Elliot	Well, girls can play baseball, too!
11354	Dr. Cox	Oh, yak-yak-yak-yak I know what girls can do! You've come a long way, baby. Spill, doll.
11355	Elliot	Look, I really think that you should think about this. So, I wrote it down, and I put it in an envelope, and then I gave it to...her.
11356	Jordan	Hi, Honey.
11357	Dr. Cox	Oh, you are just so gonna pay for this.
11358	Elliot	Yeah...well, uh, so are you.

11360	Dr. Cox	Oh!
11361	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11362	Dr. Kelso	I think Mr. Singer's going to be just fine.
11363	Dr. Townshend	Oh, geez, Bob! Don't creep up on me like that! I almost dropped some fruit in my loops!
11364	Dr. Kelso	I'm sorry, buddy. Say, listen, uh...nowadays it has become kind of hospital protocol to do modified Seldinger in a case like this. You _do_ know how to do one of those, don't you?
11365	Dr. Townshend	'Course!
11366	Dr. Kelso	Good. Because the patient in bed number 2 needs one. You mind doing it for me?
11367	Dr. Townshend	What the hell's this all about?
11368	Dr. Kelso	Nothing! I was, uh, just looking over your files and, um...well...your osteoporotic patients aren't on Bisphosphonate; your diabetics aren't on ACE inhibitors. Doug, a lot of your treatments are pretty out of date.
11369	Dr. Townshend	Come on, Bob, I'm guys like us, we're set in our ways.
11370	Dr. Kelso	Well, this is not an age thing, Doug. Hell, these days if you've been out of med school five years, half of what you learned is obsolete. Why do you think I spend every other weekend at a seminar in some two-star hotel ballroom that still stinks of last night's prom vomit? I do it because I have to keep up.
11371	Dr. Townshend	Also, it gives you two days away from the missus, right? Once again, I am sorry I was the one who introduced you in the first place!
11372	Dr. Townshend	Look, Bob, I just...I don't have the energy for all that stuff.
11373	Dr. Kelso	Well...then we got a problem.
11374	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11375	Turk	So, you wanna talk about what happened?
11376	Kevin	Nah, man, look, it's it's just too depressing.
11377	Turk	Kevin, you're in a bad place right now, but you're gonna get through it. You just gotta give it time.
11378	Kevin	Yeah, well what am I supposed to do until then?
11379	Turk	Barkeep, I'm gonna need these two glasses, and that bottle of whisky.

11382	Jordan	We are a horrible couple.
11383	Dr. Cox	You couldn't be more wrong. Because, even though that isn't my kid in there, I still want to feel connected. And I just thought I'd be more hooked in if I knew.
11384	Jordan	It's funny. Every time I think you're the same old sharp-edged jack-ass, you turn around and do something to remind me that you're such a pansy.
11385	Dr. Cox	Ahh.
11386	Jordan	Listen, I was really hoping that the two of us could find out when the baby comes. But, if you really need to know now, just keep it to yourself.
11387	Dr. Cox	Yeah, run away, there, missy. 'Cause guilt trips don't work on ol' Perr-a-reeno. Ah?
11388	Dr. Kelso	Sport, if you're still standing there when I turn around, I'm gonna have them erase your name, too.
11389	J.D.	Goodnight, sir.
11390	J.D.'s Narration	It's not always easy to do the right thing.
11391	Turk	This is to my brother, y'all! My brother!
11392	J.D.'s Narration	Like putting someone else's feelings first for a change.
11393	J.D.'s Narration	Even if it goes against what you really want.
11394	Dr. Cox	I'm out.
11395	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, there's always ramifications....
11396	J.D.	My car....
11397	Troy	Yeeeeeeee-ha!
11398	J.D.	You think it's my fault he got fired, don't you.
11399	Janitor	Why would you say that?
11400	J.D.	No reason.
11401	Troy	Let's see ya drive home now, Mr. Doctor-Man!
11402	Janitor	Troy. I said just stand there, didn't I.
11403	Troy	Yeah....
11404	Janitor	I may have to get rid of the guy.
11405	J.D.'s Narration	Even if you do the right thing, there's no guarantee it'll turn out the right way.
11406	Kevin	He ain't heavy...he's my brother....
11407	Turk	the brother!
11408	Kevin	Oh, oh. She, uh, she's not with him. And she ain't with me. She's, uh, she’s with Rowdy not like not like that.

11413	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oops. Wrong person.
11414	Carla	What happened?

11416	Turk	Baby, you know how much I care about you, right?
11417	Carla	I'm dizzy.
11418	Turk	Yeah, you're fine. Honey, I know it looked really bad last night, with me and Kevin coming home all liquored up with a really hot chick, but Kevin was freaking out about his divorce and I was just trying to be supportive.
11419	Dr. Cox	Yeah, by dragging home some random bar skank.
11420	Turk	Yeah, dude, you're not helping.
11421	Dr. Cox	Not trying to help.
11422	Turk	The point is, I have figured out why you're not ready to marry me yet. You think I'm too immature.
11423	Carla	It's not about that.
11424	Turk	Is it my sleep toots? 'Cause, Baby, I will stop having dairy after six.
11425	Carla	I don't know what it is, Turk. Since the moment you asked me, all I wanted to do was say yes. It's just that, every time I try to, something stops me. You just...have to be patient.
11426	Turk	Yeah, about that....
11427	Carla	So, he just said he was gonna keep asking until I said yes.
11428	Elliot	That was exactly how I lost my virginity. Except, I'm guessing Turk didn't propose in Jim Vilicetti's crawl-space.
11429	Carla	Yes?
11430	Turk	Woo-hoo! You said yes! We're getting married! We're getting married!
11431	Carla	Turk. Stop celebrating that's just how I answer the phone. ... Honey, it's only been ten minutes since we last talked....
11432	Paul	Don't you hate it when people yap away on their cell phones.

11435	Paul	Hey, don't you work at the hospital, too?
11436	Elliot	Yeah. Um...I actually just got off a double shift, that's...why I look so gross.
11437	Paul	You don't look gross. And you know what? You don't even _think_ you look gross. I'm guessing you're one of those girls who uses the self-deprecating thing as a defense mechanism; even though, without looking, you can tell right now how many guys are checking you out.
11438	Elliot	Okay, five.
11439	Paul	No, no. Actually, it's four the guy in the mullet, he's checking me out.

11450	Turk	'Kay, let's get one thing straight: This has nothing to do with me being black this has something to do with me being smooth, dawg

11454	Jenny	I'm a vanilla girl.
11455	J.D.	Mmm?

11463	Elliot	See you tomorrow.
11464	Elliot	Oh my God!

11475	J.D.'s Narration	I've gotta say, life is pretty good. I've hit my stride as a doctor, all my patients are doing well, and I've finally figured out that, even though they're horribly uncomfortable, my medium scrubs have a large effect on the ladies.
11476	J.D.'s Narration	Yep, everything is just great. I feel like, for the first time since I started here, I have no stories to tell.
11477	Dr. Cox's Narration	Sometimes you know it's gonna be a crappy day from the moment you wake up. Today was one of those days.
11478	Dr. Cox's Narration	See, I have an appointment to see my shrink, and it feels like there's a little friction between us.
11479	Cox's Shrink	You will _not_ beat me.
11480	Dr. Cox	Listen, Doctor, while we're on me, just for a second, uh, my very pregnant ex-wife would like me to take a couple of days off and travel to her mother's house so that we can reconnect as a family.
11481	Cox's Shrink	And I assume that you told her to blow it out her ass.
11482	Dr. Cox	You get me! Darn it, you do!
11483	Cox's Shrink	Yes.... We're like two peas in a horrible, horrible pod.
11484	Dr. Cox	Anyway, I have invited a couple of my friends over to the apartment while she's gonna to be gone we're gonna have some beers, watch the game, it's gonna be great and I was wondering if you
11485	Cox's Shrink	I'm not your friend!
11486	Dr. Cox	They're not, either.
11487	Cox's Shrink	So, how's your rage going lately?

11492	Dr. Cox	Oh, give it to me.
11493	Cox's Shrink	...I want you to take a deep breath and count to ten before you react. Do you think you could do that, Perry?

11505	Dr. Cox	I don't care!
11506	Dr. Cox's Thoughts	Dammit!
11507	Dr. Kelso	Perry! Hi, how are you, etcetera. The wife and I just took out a new insurance policy, and I need a physical.
11508	Dr. Cox	Bob, the day I willingly cradle your dusty old twig and berries and get a whiff of your chronic halitosis while you turn your head and cough is the day you can look for me up on the roof singing, "I Believe I Can Fly."
11509	Dr. Kelso	Great stuff! See you about two-ish.
11510	Dr. Cox	Uh.
11511	J.D.	You should just do it.
11512	Dr. Cox	Really?
11513	J.D.	Well, it'd only take fifteen minutes of your life, and it wouldn't hurt to be in good with him for once.
11514	Dr. Cox	You're giving me advice?
11515	J.D.	Yeah. Feel free to return the favor.
11516	Dr. Cox	Fair enough. Try this on for size: No matter where you go in life, always keep an eye out for Johnny, the tackling Alzheimer's patient.
11517	J.D.	What's that supposed to mean?
11518	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11519	Nurse Roberts	Mm-hmm. Well, just run one of the other nurses down here with some bedpans, please.
11520	Nurse	Laverne, why can't you do it?
11521	Nurse Roberts	'Cause I've been here for twenty-three years and my feet hurt, that's why.
11522	Nurse	Well, thanks a lot! After all I've done for you....
11523	Elliot	Oh, Laverne, I am so excited about this doctor that I just met. He's nice...and humble.... I just hate it how so many doctors are so self-centered, you know?
11524	Nurse Roberts	Mm. I know exactly what you mean, girl. Just yesterday, I was
11525	Elliot	Oh, and he's so cute, too!
11526	Paul	Hey, fresh bedpans, here. Get 'em before they're hot.
11527	Paul	Dr. Reid!
11528	Elliot	Hey! Uh, Nurse...um...Paul.
11529	Paul	It's Paul Flowers, actually.

11533	Turk	Marry me.
11534	Carla	Still thinking.
11535	Turk	Okay. Baby, I have finally figured out what's bothering you, though.
11536	Carla	Really?
11537	Turk	Yep. You think I haven't played the field enough.
11538	Turk	Well, I just want you to know that I have had a long, productive playing career, over which time I have slept with many, many women....
11539	Turk	And by "many, many women" I mean...three.
11540	Carla	Mmmmmm.
11541	Turk	Take away two, equals one, and that's you. Marry me?
11542	Turk	"No."
11543	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11544	Dr. Cox	All right, so here's the deal: I want to see all you guys at my place tonight even you, Zeltzer. Get there around 7:30, it's gonna be great; we're gonna have food, booze, the whole nine yards.
11545	Dr. Zeltzer	Uh, will there be prostitutes?
11546	Dr. Cox	Noo!
11547	Dr. Zeltzer	Oh, uh, good.
11548	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11549	Dr. Cox's Thoughts	It's just a physical. You can be cordial.
11550	Dr. Cox	Whatta ya say, there, Bob. How 'bout we do just like you do with Enid close our eyes, pretend we're with someone else, and be done before Leno starts.
11551	Dr. Kelso	Save the 'racket' for the tennis court, big guy. I have taken the liberty of filling out the form, all you have to do is sign right below where it says "Fit as a 26-year-old."
11552	Dr. Cox	You're not suggesting that I rubber-stamp your insurance physical, are you, there, Bobbo?
11553	Dr. Kelso	Just...sign the damn form!
11554	Dr. Cox	Or...you could take your shirt off right now and be done with all this in the next five minutes. I am not going to make this uncomfortable for you, come on, I'm a professional.
11555	Dr. Kelso	Okay.
11556	Dr. Cox	Buh-duh-na-duhhh...ooh!...ba-duh-duh-duhhh....da-bow!
11557	Dr. Cox	Had to be done, Bob. Continue, handsome.
11558	J.D.	How's it going?
11559	Patient	I just got my vertebrae fused.
11560	J.D.	I got nothing.

11570	Carla	Come on, Elliot. So, Paul's a male nurse. You're a big enough person not to let that bother you, right?
11571	Elliot	I'm dating a _murse_.
11572	J.D.	Better than a 'mecretary.' Or a 'manicurist.' No, that works.
11573	Elliot	It's no big deal you guys are the only ones who know.... And Nurse Roberts.
11574	Elliot	She's not _that_ much of a gossip. Is she?
11575	***Surreal Scene	Nurse Roberts is running through at top speed, passing on some very important information to everyone she sees.
11576	Nurse Roberts	Dr. Reid, Nurse Paul! Dr. Reid, Nurse Paul! Dr. Reid, Nurse Paul! Dr. Reid, Nurse Paul!!! Dr. Reid, Nurse Paul! Dr. Reid, Nurse Paul! Dr. Reid, Nurse Paul!
11577	Dr. Cox	Ohhh, talking about thirty-six inches, and about 70 pounds. Plus he's twice as fast as the other guy.
11578	Nurse Roberts	Dr. Reid...Nurse Paul...dating.
11579	Dr. Cox	Giant "Who cares?"
11580	Dr. Cox	So, I'll see you fellas tonight, what, around 7:30? Don't be late, or you won't get a seat!
11581	J.D.	I'll bring the Fluffer Nutters!
11582	Dr. Cox	Newbie, I'd invite you, unfortunately it's guys only.
11583	Dr. Kelso	You! And your damn physical! Thanks to the high blood pressure you found, my insurance premium is gonna cost me an extra six grand this year! That's six grand my wife already spent on a new chin! If I were you, I would be planning to work every holiday from now until a few months after you're dead!
11584	Dr. Cox	Newbie, this is your fault!
11585	Dr. Cox's Thoughts	Where is he? Where is that little rat bastard?
11586	J.D.	Ohh. Hey, pal!
11587	J.D.	I'll always remember our time together. Gotta go!
11588	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11589	Turk	Marry me.
11590	Carla	Still thinking.
11591	Turk	Baby, I figured it out. This is what you're afraid of: The typical surgeon a dumb, arrogant frat-boy whose behavior is so disgusting, it is embarrassing for a woman to be _seen_ with him.
11592	Carla	Mm.
11593	Turk	No offense, buddy.
11594	Todd	None taken. Hey, I gotta run. They're doing a breast reduction on three, and I want to get up there and try and stop it! You know what I'm talking about!
11595	Carla	It's not The Todd.
11596	Turk	It's gotta be The Todd.
11597	Carla	Turk, will you stop?
11598	Carla	Yes, I've never been a big fan of surgeons. And, yes, I worry about your maturity sometimes I'm a worrier, it's what I do. But you have _got_ to stop trying to pinpoint what the reason is.
11599	Turk	'Cause there's so many of them, right? I mean, you don't like who I am...you don't like what I do....
11600	Carla	Come on. I like the way I have to stand up on my tippy-toes to kiss you.
11601	Turk	It's not enough.
11602	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11603	Todd	Hey, Elliot, I heard you got your nursing degree in the 'male'...nurse! Wazzaaaaap.
11604	Dr. Zeltzer	That's her. Don't look!
11605	Dr. Kelso	Murse!
11606	Paul	Whoa, Doctor! Hey, I'm not that type of gal.
11607	Elliot	Shut up, Paul! You are a man! And I am a woman!
11608	Paul	Elliot, are you okay?
11609	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11610	Cox's Shrink	I got very drunk last night.... And I decided that I'm not giving up on you. So...how'd you do with my counting exercise?
11611	Dr. Cox	Honestly, I tried it once and I thought it was stupid.
11612	Cox's Shrink	That's it we're done.
11613	Dr. Cox	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You're dumping _me_?
11614	Cox's Shrink	I hope we can remain friends!
11615	Dr. Cox	Oh, now, please don't take away the privilege of letting me pay you two hundred dollars an hour so that I can drag my ass in here and watch you nod. God knows the only other place I can get that on the planet is from my Brett Favre bobble-head doll.
11616	Cox's Shrink	Fine. You want to know what I really think? Your problem isn't that you make bad choices, it's that you identify the good choice and then intentionally do the opposite. You see, behind this boorish bravado of yours is a paralyzing fear of letting anyone into your life. And it isn't because you weren't _loved when you were a kid_, it's because you're so ego-centered that the love wasn't enough. So, you pulled pig-tails and you pushed the fat kids into the dirt so no one could ignore little Perry. Well "little Perry" is now forty years old. And you're so invested in this neurotic, narcissistic notion of yourself as "_loner_" that you can't quit. And you'll just keep dumping on everyone around you, until eventually and please, trust me on this there won't be anyone left.
11617	Dr. Cox's Narration	There's a million reasons a relationship can crash and burn....
11618	Dr. Cox	Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hooooo.... Gimme a break.
11619	Dr. Cox's Narration	Whether it's because you don't have the stones to make it work...
11620	Elliot	Sorry, I have to...um...cancel tonight.
11621	Dr. Cox's Narration	...or, you just get sick and tired of jumping through hoops.
11622	Turk	Okay, you win; all right, you don't have to worry about me asking you over and over anymore.
11623	Dr. Cox's Narration	Eventually, everyone bails.
11624	J.D. comes to the front door and knocks	knock, knock-knock, knock, knock...
11625	J.D.	"Two bits."
11626	Dr. Cox	If it isn't my favorite career counselor. You wouldn't happen to have any more tips on how to climb _down_ the ladder, would ya?
11627	J.D.	I've been doing some thinking, about how you're always blaming me for everything, and how you just send a constant stream of crap my way...and...I decided I need a break.
11628	Dr. Cox	So, what'd you come by to tell me you're a complete wuss?
11629	J.D.	No. I...came over here to tell you that I traded with another resident and switched off your service for a while.
11630	Dr. Cox	Well, tears-&-hugs, there, Katie. But, unless you want to come inside, here, and give one of the fellas a lap-dance, I'm afraid I gotta say Sayonara, 'cause I got twenty guys in here and it's about to get nutty! All the best, baby.

11634	Cox's Shrink	I have a hammer in my desk.
11635	Dr. Cox's Narration	...It...did not go well.
11636	Doug	Uh, Dr. Cox. I was the one who switched with J.D.
11637	Dr. Cox	Nervous Guy.... How you feeling?
11638	Doug	A little nervous.
11639	Dr. Cox	Oh, that's okay. Don't worry about a thing, 'cause I'm gonna ease you in. Here's the deal: You have exactly eight seconds to find this patient's chart or you're through here.
11640	Doug	God! Chart? Chart? Anyone?
11641	Nurse Roberts	You want me to look for it?
11642	Doug	Did anyone see a chart?!
11643	Dr. Cox	Nah, I got the chart right here.

11647	Carla	What?
11648	Elliot	Well, when I was little, and something made me sad, my mom would always have the maid give me a cheer-up hug.
11649	Carla	Ahhh, further explaining your love of the Latino people.
11650	Elliot	Carla, whenever you need to talk....
11651	Carla	You know, it's just that I don't think that Turk is being fair. He didn't get the answer that he wanted when he wanted it, so now he's pushing
11652	Paul	What do you want?
11653	Paul	Okay, wait, wait, wait. Now, are you kissing me because you actually want this to go somewhere, or because you feel bad about blowing me off yesterday?

11655	Paul	Actually, I don't care either way.

11668	Woman 2	Yeah, I've got one.
11669	Dr. Cox	Come here!
11670	J.D.	I don't think he'd do well in group. So, uh, what's up with Carla?
11671	Turk	I'm starting to think that if she really loved me I'd know by now. Maybe it's time to retreat, protect myself, so I don't get hurt any worse. I really don't want to talk about it, though.
11672	J.D.	Sure.
11673	Jenny	Here you go, fellas.
11674	Together	Thank you, Jenny.

11684	Dr. Kelso	I'm sorry.
11685	Dr. Cox	What did you say?
11686	Dr. Kelso	I spoke to my cardiologist, and he said if you hadn't caught my high blood-pressure, and it had continued unchecked, it, uh, might have resulted in a mild case of....death.

11699	Dr. Kelso	Well, that's because you're doing a woman's job, son. Have a good one.
11700	Elliot	Great. Why did you do that?
11701	Paul	You know, Elliot, what I do for a living, it doesn't make me feel like I'm any less of a man. Neither does my love of baking...or gardening...or the fact that I occasionally menstruate.

11708	Cox's Shrink	Hello, Perry. You're obviously trying to bully me, but you can't bully me because I don't fear you. Now, I'm leaving.
11709	Dr. Cox	Kelso asked me to give him a physical, I did it, he said "thank you" and told me he owed me one.
11710	Cox's Shrink	You _actually_ made a decision that benefited your life personally and professionally?
11711	Dr. Cox	Well, a resident kinda talked me into it.
11712	Cox's Shrink	Yeah, come on, you're telling me that _you_ took the advice of another human being.
11713	Cox's Shrink	It's a great moment for me.
11714	Dr. Cox	Congratulations.
11715	Cox's Shrink	Thank you. And Perry, if there's someone in your life at that hell-hole of a hospital who you actually listen to, you should do everything in your power to keep them around. Because that person is nothing short of a genius.

11724	Carla	Hey, Laverne, have you seen Turk around?
11725	Nurse Roberts	He's off today, Honey. How come you don't know that?
11726	Carla	I don't know....
11727	Elliot	Listen up everybody! I appreciate solidarity, but I did not blow off Paul because he's a nurse; so, please stop leaving bedpans in my locker it makes me cry. Paul and I are just...different, okay.
11728	Carla	Please, Elliot, this is not about Paul.... This is about you! This is about you not being able to commit, because committing means saying goodbye to whatever unfulfilled fantasy of love you've concocted after seeing too many Meg Ryan movies. But men don't come and make everything all better they're only human. And you shouldn't punish him because you were forced to grow up so fast you never learned how to let someone else take care of you. He's not your father, okay, he's not necessarily gonna disappear at the first sign of trouble. And, as scary as it is to consider letting yourself be truly vulnerable with another human being, what's even scarier is that deep down inside you know you picked this man...and if you run away from him now, you'll be running away from being the kind of person you always wanted to be.
11729	Elliot	Carla, I...just met the guy!
11730	Turk	All right, here we go, baby; here we go.
11731	Jenny	Are you talking to your chili dog!?
11732	Turk	What? Hey!
11733	Turk	Uh, yeah well, I find that they don't repeat on me as much if I'm real friendly to 'em.
11734	Jenny	Oh.
11735	Jenny	What?
11736	Turk	Nothing, it's just it's just weird seeing you out in the real world, you know, I feel kind of guilty. 'Cause you're so nice to me and my buddy, and we've never even had a real conversation. Instead, we act like school kids and argue over who we think you got a crush on.

11757	Janitor	Hey, I'll hang on to this!
11758	J.D.'s Narration	I guess, in the end, everything comes down to timing.
11759	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes, you just have one moment to seize it.
11760	Elliot	Paul. I know that I've been acting like an insecure idiot, but...if you'll forgive me, I'd love to take you for dinner tonight.
11761	Paul	Screw that. I'll cook for you.
11762	Paul	I've only got one apron, though; so, bring your own if you want to wear one.

11787	J.D.	Oh, come on, this is the only way to celebrate, right? With close friends...and...Nurse Roberts....
11788	Nurse Roberts	Oh, hey, now, don't get all pissy now. You said "My treat, order whatever you want." You didn't say "order whatever you want except the lobster."
11789	J.D.	I said "no shellfish."
11790	J.D.'s Narration	I wasn't really mad. This was great except for one thing.
11791	Paul	Hey, you can't celebrate without beer.

11794	J.D.	Okay, I'll, uh, I'll go ahead and and make a little toast, here. Uh, a toast that only people that've known...Turk and Carla more than a week will understand. You guys rock. You do.
11795	J.D.'s Thoughts	How's that taste, Blondie!
11796	Paul	You guys, you know, I've just gotten to know you as a couple, but you remind me of my grandparents. They were married for sixty-five years, and every night before Grandpa and Grandma would walk around the block, he would look deep into her eyes as if to say, "I'd follow you anywhere." Anyway, the way you two just looked at each other, I could have sworn I was looking at them.
11797	J.D.	Lame! This guy.

11799	J.D.	Morning, Dr. Kelso.
11800	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Dorian, how is it this whole hospital gets up in arms every time our MRI machine misses a tumor, but every morning our lousy coffee machine spits out warm urine and nobody gives two hoots!?
11801	J.D.	We missed another tumor?
11802	Dr. Kelso	Who cares! The point is, I have to go across the street to get coffee! Piping-hot coffee that puts a hop in your step and your ass in the john.
11803	Mr. Simms	I just wish I really knew why it hurt so much right here.
11804	Turk	Well, Mr. Simms, it could be because it's damp out. It could also be because, four days ago, I sliced your chest open with a giant knife. You had surgery, buddy, you'll be fine.
11805	Turk	Hey, Dr. Dorian, I have a couple of minutes off. Would you like me to show you that technique I was telling you about?
11806	J.D.	Yes, Doctor.
11807	Turk	See, now, what you want to do is choke up on the club like this? And then hit this bad boy like a baseball!
11808	J.D.	You can't teach that.
11809	Turk	No you cannot, my friend. No you cannot!
11810	J.D.	So, what was up with Mr. Simms back there?
11811	Turk	Ahhh, during his open-lung biopsy, I accidentally nicked his intercostal artery, and now he's got a hematoma.
11812	J.D.	Are you gonna tell him?
11813	Turk	What, and risk a lawsuit? Are you crazy? Besides, it'll heal just fine, anyway. Hey, throw me another ball.
11814	J.D.	Yeah, but...don't you believe in bad karma?
11815	Turk	No!
11816	Dr. Kelso	Hot cuppa lava, coming through.
11817	Dr. Kelso	Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaggggggggggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!
11818	J.D.	I dunno. Me, I think karma keeps the universe in order.
11819	Turk	Karma, schmarma. Now listen, if you're not getting the length on the drive that you need, a lot of the better pros take a running start.
11820	J.D.	Righty-o.

11822	J.D.'s Narration	In medicine, you get used to seeing a lot of horrible things.
11823	Dr. Kelso	Morning, sport.
11824	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, my God! Do _not_ say "splotchy."
11825	J.D.	Good splotchy, Dr. Splotchy.
11826	Dr. Kelso	Oh, please, it's barely noticeable.
11827	Dr. Cox	Ohhh! Dark Roast!
11828	Dr. Kelso	Dammit!
11829	J.D.	There she is! Are you ready to be born today! Jeebeedeebeejeebee....
11830	Jordan	Get the hell away from my stomach, or I'll put you in a leg-lock and snap your little bird-neck with my enormous thighs.
11831	J.D.	Enjoy your special day.
11832	Jordan	Thanks.
11833	Dr. Cox	Now, in honor of this little goblin's arrival, I have gone ahead and taken care of everything: Dr. Gerson will be _waiting_ to induce you; she will also administer the world's largest epidural. I have wealthily under-qualified residents covering all of my patients, so that I can be with you every step of the way. And, here's the kicker: I have traded every single one of my weekends, I have called in every favor, and I have kissed every pompous, wrinkled ass in this fluorescent hell-hole, so that I could secure for you the one and only mack-daddy, out-of-your-mind birthing suite in this entire hospital!
11834	Jordan	Nice job, Alice.

11836	Elliot	Hey, Paul.
11837	Paul	What are you doing down here?
11838	Elliot	Oh, I just need a nurse to help me out.
11839	Paul	Hey, this name-tag says Paul Flowers, Nurse not Paul Flowers, Elliot Reid's Boyfriend. Now, what do you need?
11840	Elliot	Mr. Mahoney threw up on himself. He needs a bath.
11841	Paul	Hey, uh, Dina, my girlfriend's got a job for you!
11842	Dina	Uh, right!
11843	Elliot	Paul, um...I just want you to know I am having such a good time with you.
11844	Paul	Me too.
11845	Paul	Hey, sorry I didn't call you last night, I just totally crashed.
11846	Elliot	No big deal.
11847	Paul	See, I love that you don't let the little things bother you. Like, right now, you've got pit stains, and you're just like, "Whatever! I'm workin' hard!"
11848	Elliot	What can I say? I'm an easy-going gal!
11849	Elliot	Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I need deodorant and a dry top over here!

11853	Turk	'Cause you're.... 'Cause you're a.....
11854	***Fantasy Sequence	J.D. is a stand-up comedian.
11855	J.D.	I said, "Not pregnant." Is this thing on? And hey! What is the deal with Q-Tips? They're not Qs, and they're not tips!
11856	J.D.	Uhhh, but unfortunately, the CAT-scan suggests a laceration in your spleen, which is why I asked for a surgical consult. So, how'd this happen, anyway?
11857	Mr. Foster	A golf ball hit my windshield, and I drove into a tree.
11858	Together	Mmm?
11859	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
11860	Dr. Cox	Okay, here's the deal: You are, in fact, supposed to be up in the mack-daddy suite, but the woman who's in there is in her fortieth hour of labor.
11861	Jordan	Did you explain to her that it is _my_ room?
11862	Dr. Cox	I started to, but then she screamed, grunted, and pooped on the table. God , it always cracks me up that they never tell pregnant women to expect that one!
11863	Jordan	I'm going to _poo_ in front of people!?
11864	Dr. Cox	No.... Yeah!
11865	Jordan	We are so done talking!
11866	Dr. Cox	Don't tease me.
11867	Jordan	Where's Dr. Gerson?
11868	Dr. Cox	She's up in that room with the woman.
11869	Jordan	Then who the hell's gonna take care of me!?
11870	Dr. Cox	She's sending her resident.

11876	Carla	Oh, I hear you, girl. I mean, Turk and I are engaged ?
11877	Elliot	Mm-hmm?
11878	Carla	and it wasn't until last week that I admitted the reason I don't touch the seat when I go to the bathroom isn't because of germs but because I'm afraid of toilet snakes.
11879	Elliot	Aaaaand now so am I.
11880	Carla	Look, I think, with men, you just have to hold out until they're invested enough they won't run away at the first thing that spooks them.
11881	Elliot	I know.... And, with Paul, I really feel like we're getting pretty close right now!
11882	Carla	So...you guys have...?
11883	Elliot	Not yet, but tonight's our fourth date, so....
11884	Carla	Four dates?
11885	Elliot	Yeah, it's one date longer than the sluts, one date shorter than the prudes. I am Four-Date Reid!
11886	Carla	Yeah, but, what about that surgeon the other
11887	Elliot	I'm Four-Date Reid!
11888	Paul	Hey, Cutie! Hey! You ready for our third date?
11889	Elliot	_Fourth_ date! You're forgetting about the time we ran into each other at the coffee machine. You shut up! Hi!
11890	Turk	What the hell am I doing playing golf!? This is all Tiger Woods' fault.
11891	J.D.	This guy's gonna sue the hospital, we're gonna get fired, we'll have to become male whores.
11892	J.D.	Very successful male whores we'll probably have a nicer apartment and some bling-bling, but male whores nonetheless!
11893	Turk	Relax, all right? Nobody knows about this but us. We'll be fine.
11894	Janitor	Hey, guys! Check out the personalized golf club cozy I found on the roof!
11895	Janitor	"Hi, Davey!"
11896	J.D.	You and your stupid Christmas present!
11897	Janitor	Yeah.... Seems like one of the golf balls you hit went through the windshield of my van. No big deal, I just expect you to replace it, that's all.
11898	J.D.	Wait, wait, wait. Your your windshield's been broken for like a year!
11899	Janitor	Yeah! Yeah, I know. Still. "Oh, no! Looks like we're in a...pickle! Pick pick pickle!" boogida-boogida-boogida-boogida-boogida-boogida-boogida-boogida-boo Pop! Here's the keys, have it back by tomorrow. Who're you?

11905	Dr. Cox	Anyway, Jordan and I got stuck in this crappy room, and I was wondering if....if....whoo, well....
11906	Dr. Kelso	Perry, if you want a favor, don't beat around the bush. Just...curtsy.
11907	Dr. Cox	I beg your pardon, there, Backdraft?

11916	J.D.	No dealio, Ted, we just stopped by to say "Hi." ...Hi.

11918	Lawyer	Later!
11919	J.D.'s Narration	We both knew what we had to do.
11920	J.D.	Let's come clean.
11921	Turk	Let's not tell anyone! Ever! Ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever! EVER!
11922	J.D.	Ever?
11923	Turk	Ever!
11924	J.D.'s Narration	I guess it's hard to predict how a person will react.
11925	Elliot	So...you wanna come in?
11926	Paul	No, it's okay. I'll see you tomorrow.
11927	Dr. Cox	Well, then, Jordan, why don't we just think of today as as a test run.
11928	J.D.'s Narration	Other times, people react exactly how you think they will.
11929	Jordan	Honestly, Perry, the only way I could have felt more taken care of is if I were at a four-star resort, or a spa...or a third-world country where you have to boil your own sewage if you want something to drink! Oh, and by the way? A giant, giant feather in your cap for how much power you wield in this hospital after 15 years.
11930	Dr. Cox	Come on, come on, come on, Jordan. I am so sorry everything fell apart today, honest-to-God, I am. But I guarantee that when you get here tomorrow, Dr. Gerson will, in fact, be in the super-deluxe birthing suite so that you can go ahead and have that story-book, drug-addled, Pitocin-induced pregnancy that you've always dreamed of ever since you were a little girl. But, in the meantime, you've gotta cut me a little slack. I mean, come on, it's not like I see the real father running around here, busting his hump.
11931	Jordan	Ohh, that's nice. I'm going home.
11932	Dr. Cox	No, no you're not.

11940	Dr. Donna	Oh, you know, I really prefer "Dr. Donna"!
11941	Dr. Cox	No means no, pep-squad. Now beat it.
11942	Dr. Cox	And, Jordan, I am not gonna leave your side until that baby is delivered.
11943	Jordan	Get the hell out of here.
11944	Dr. Cox	What?
11945	Jordan	I'm serious. Why don't you do us both a favor and get out.
11946	Dr. Cox	...Fine.
11947	Dr. Donna	It's important to stay positive!

11952	Dr. Cox	Gimme a break I got a lot on my mind, Ellen! Ooh! Look at that! I bounced back! A-hey-anyway, the cave bat just kicked me out of its lair, and seeing as I no longer have my all-access pass to crazy town, I'm going to need you to occasionally go in there and poke her with a broomstick, just to see how she's doing.

11954	Dr. Cox	Uh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh! Please! Just...check on her, 'kay? All right.

11982	Dr. Cox	Why?
11983	Carla	Ate 'em all.
11984	Dr. Cox	Sounds like good roughage to me.
11985	Carla	What do you do when you get scared?
11986	Dr. Cox	Run away, get a divorce, drink alone.... You know, the classics. The thing is that, this time, I am killing myself for this woman, and I'm still getting my ass handed to me.
11987	Carla	There is no Shangri-La, you know? Every relationship is messed up. What makes it perfect is if you still want to be there when things really suck.

12032	Paul	It's just, well, this is what bothered me the other night. 'Cause I I know that there's something wrong, but y-you won't talk about it. I guess sometimes it it feels like you're holding back.
12033	Elliot	Of course I'm holding back! I'm insane, you idiot! Remember the other day, when you told me that I had pit stains? Well, I have cried every fifteen minutes on the half-hour since you told me that. I am wracked with self-doubt. I have panic attacks. I'm claustrophobic, germaphobic, phobiaphobic. I talk to myself. I talk to my cat. I talk to three separate shrinks about the fact that often my cats respond to me in my mother's voice. And yesterday, when that stupid pretty surgical nurse handed you a pair of latex gloves, I almost killed the guy whose leg I was stitching up because I couldn't stop thinking about the two of you having sex on a box of steaks! Why a box of steaks? 'Cause my dad had an affair with a female butcher! And, as I mentioned before, I am insane. There! I opened up! Are you happy?
12034	Paul	No. I'm incredibly turned on.

12044	Jordan	He asked you to...check in on me?
12045	J.D.	Yep. So...? How ya doin'?
12046	Jordan	Well, I have ruined everything! All he tried to do was take care of me and show me that he loved me. But, no, I had to drive him away because I don't like being vulnerable even when I'm normal, let alone with my ankles in stirrups and my coochie on display. So, now he's gone away for good; and I would really like to get this stupid thing out of me so I can go home and kill myself!
12047	J.D.	Well, you sound good.
12048	Jordan	I was going to tell him the truth eventually, I just wanted to see if he was going to be with me because he _wanted_ to, not because he _had_ to. Do you know what I mean?
12049	J.D.	What are you talking about?
12050	Jordan	It's his baby, stupid! Don't tell anyone.

12066	J.D.'s Narration	Either way, it's a lot to think about.

12074	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, fine. I'll just read the wall.
12075	J.D.	"J.D. has a tiny pickle"?
12076	Dr. Cox	Kudos for honesty, there, Newbie but, again, no talking.
12077	J.D.	Dr. Cox, I have to tell you something....
12078	Jordan	Oh! Perry, you pee standing up at work! That is so cute! Would you come on? We're on a very tight schedule.
12079	Dr. Cox	You know, Jordan, with all the baby weight you haven't lost yet, I just went ahead and assumed you'd be used to tight things by now.
12080	Jordan	Oh, that's lovely.
12081	Jordan	Huh! Well, hello, sailor.
12082	J.D.	Ahoy.
12083	Dr. Cox	Oh, my goodness, Newbie. Are you so uncomfortable with Jordan here that you've, in fact, stopped peeing mid-stream?
12084	J.D.	I may have.
12085	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12086	Dr. Kelso	Yes!
12087	J.D.	I wonder why Dr. Cox and Jordan got divorced? I mean, they act like they hate each other, but I think that's just for show.
12088	Turk	Yeah, whatever. Are you gonna stretch before we play basketball, or what?
12089	J.D.'s Narration	Turk likes to blow off steam by playing basketball before surgery. I always get my ass kicked.... But not today.
12090	J.D.	Grrrrrr.
12091	Turk	And that's game!
12092	J.D.	How the hell did we lose?! We have Chet!
12093	Chet	Sorry, man.
12094	J.D.	Chet, you suck!!!
12095	J.D.	AAARRRGGGHHH!!!
12096	J.D.	You know what, some stereotypes are true, Turk. Okay? And, just maybe, black people are a little better at basketball. Whatta you say?
12097	***Fantasy Sequence	Nurse Roberts, who had been watching the game with a few other gathered staffers, has the ball. The Harlem Globetrotters theme plays as she does some hot tricks, leaps through the air, and dunks the ball, swinging on the basket.
12098	Nurse Roberts	HAH!
12099	Turk	Maybe a little.
12100	Nurse Roberts	Y'all got hockey.
12101	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12102	J.D.	Why do you think they got divorced?
12103	Elliot	Oh, I have no idea. I just can't believe you had to pee in front of Jordan! I could _not_ do that. I mean, Paul's my boyfriend, and I make him turn the volume way up on the T.V. when I go. Plus, he's not allowed in the apartment an hour before _or_ after I do twosies.
12104	J.D.	Elliot, you're a doctor stop calling it "twosies."
12105	Elliot	Oh, with patients I say "dookie." Oh, dookie!
12106	J.D.	What?
12107	Dr. Cox	Well, now, Maggie! I can only assume that you are whiling away the morning cat-chatting with your favorite gal-pal because you've already finished your pre-rounding?
12108	J.D.	I haven't even started yet.
12109	Dr. Cox	What?
12110	J.D.	Gotcha! Finished!
12111	Dr. Cox	That's a good one, Newbie. My heart is racing. You are quite the prankster.
12112	J.D.	I could tell you some stories.
12113	Dr. Cox	And if there's a God in heaven, you never will. This is Mrs. Gracin's chart her private practice doctor just showed up, so I am off this one.
12114	J.D.	Well, is there anything I need to do for her lung nodule?
12115	Dr. Cox	Oh, I don't know. What do you say you start her on 20 CCs of It's not my problem anymore!
12116	J.D.'s Thoughts	Great. Another pretentious private practice guy who's gonna order me around while he counts his money all day.

12118	Pete	Hey! You must be J.D.!
12119	J.D.'s Thoughts	He knows my name.
12120	Pete	I'm Dr. Fisher I go by Pete. Never call me Petey, we'll be friends for life. Hey, look at this. Don't believe me? Already got you a latte, buddy. Look at that.
12121	J.D.	Thanks! A latte!
12122	Pete	That's funny! We got a good one, Sally!
12123	J.D.'s Thoughts	How is that funny? Eh, just go with it.
12124	J.D.	You know, I'm always pulling pranks, too. Like, before, Dr. Cox was like, "Did you do that pre-rounding?"
12125	Pete	You know what I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you; I do want to hear the end of that story, though could you get a pulmonary consult for Sally for me?
12126	J.D.	Yeah, we yeah.
12127	Pete	You're probably thinking, Why didn't you do that before I got here? But you weren't sure if you'd be over-stepping your boundaries. What if I was some sort of territorial ass with a giant ego or a territorial ego with a giant ass. Stop me, Sally, please!
12128	J.D.	Ha!
12129	Pete	And you're gonna help me. Need you to help me get Sally, here, out of bed; that way I can go back to trying to get her _into_ bed.
12130	Sally	Stop!
12131	Pete	You stop, foxy lady! Look, you're doing great. From now on, just follow your instincts, okay? And you, don't flirt so much.
12132	Sally	Wanna make him jealous?
12133	J.D.	No. "Thank thanks a latte!" Thank thank well 'cau well well "thanks a lot!" I oh, "Thanks a latte"! I got it!

12135	J.D.'s Narration	At a hospital, there's always one sure way to deal with boredom.
12136	J.D.	You guys wanna go laugh at the narcoleptic guy?
12137	J.D.'s Narration	I know it sounds insensitive, but let's face it narcolepsy is a funny condition. And it can be triggered by a number of things.... Like stress.
12138	Shot of	A kid in a classroom, passed out on top of his test paper.
12139	J.D.'s Narration	Or anger, from, say, three double-bogeys in a row.
12140	Shot of	A golf cart being driven across a course by a man slumped over the steering wheel.
12141	J.D.'s Narration	Or...in Mr. Hilliard's case....
12142	Turk	Sexual arousal!?!
12143	Elliot	I'm goin' in.
12144	Nurse Roberts	Is falling asleep _after_ sex considered narcolepsy? 'Cause if it is, Mr. Roberts got it.
12145	J.D.	Okay, so, first she's gonna stick her chest out...and then she'll toss her hair....
12146	Carla	That's sexy.
12147	Turk	And, drop!
12148	Elliot	Oh! Oops!
12149	J.D.	Oh, that did it.
12150	Elliot	Hell yeah!
12151	Elliot	I have a boyfriend, work is going well, I actually feel cute for the first time in my life; my self-esteem cannot be touched!
12152	Carla	It's been so weird since I got engaged.
12153	Elliot	Oh, you're right I'll never get married! Message received!
12154	Carla	Elliot! This is about me.
12155	Elliot	Oh, really?
12156	Carla	Yeah.
12157	Elliot	Ohh, 'kay.
12158	Carla	It's like, I don't feel attractive at all lately. Like I've lost my spark or something.
12159	Elliot	Oh, please! Remember what Kelso said about your hair yesterday?
12160	***Flashback	Dr. Kelso faces the camera.
12161	Dr. Kelso	It makes you look frumpy!
12162	Elliot	I thought he said "clumpy"!

12167	Dr. Kelso	Morning, boys!
12168	Turk	Sir? This is where we play.
12169	Dr. Kelso	Funny. I thought this was where we worked?
12170	Turk	Dr. Kelso, I have a low-anterior resection later on this afternoon, and I'd really like to exercise in order to be at my best.
12171	Dr. Kelso	Well...I'd really like to have grand-kids someday, but the last five Christmases, my son has brought his roommate Brad home! So, you tell me whether life is fair.

12173	J.D.	I can't believe you did your residency here, too!
12174	Pete	You kidding me? We lived, we loved, we sang to each other, for crying out loud. Hey, Laverne, remember the time you and I got a little crazy, right? Went down to the waterfall, stripped off our scrubs, dove in. You remember that, Laverne?
12175	Nurse Roberts	Are you hittin' the crack-pipe?
12176	Pete	See, that's the kind of magic I'm talking about, buddy!
12177	Dr. Cox	Hey, ladies.
12178	J.D.	Oh, you two must already know each other.
12179	Pete	Dr. Cox.
12180	Dr. Cox	Petey.
12181	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes, when you're in an awkward situation, the best thing to do is to go to your happy place.
12182	***Fantasy Sequence	'The Tonight Show'
12183	Jay Leno	...Well, it's not uncommon! I think a lot of people keep, uh, plants in their apartment. Right, J.D.?
12184	J.D.	Oh, Jay! You're so crazy!
12185	Pete	We have a little history.... Yeah....
12186	J.D.	What's up his pooper?
12187	Pete	Actually, I think he's mad 'cause I went into private practice and he's stuck in this hell-hole.
12188	J.D.	Yeah.
12189	Pete	You wouldn't believe this, but that guy was my mentor, man. I mean, I lived and breathed for that guy's approval.
12190	J.D.	That's lame.
12191	Pete	I know! Once you learn the tricks, though, he's easier to deal with; you'll see.
12192	J.D.	Tell me about it.
12193	Pete	Yeah!
12194	J.D.	No, no, I'm serious tell me about it.
12195	Pete	Oh! Ohh. Uh, well, you know when he gets on his rants, he gets all hyped up, his vein starts sticking out of his neck, and he starts yelling at ya when he's done, just look at him, stare him right in the eye, and say, "I'm sorry, what were you saying?"
12196	Pete	I don't know why, but it works; trust me.
12197	J.D.	No, I do. Now, how do you get him to stop calling you girl's names.

12205	Elliot	It _is_ always coming loose!
12206	Janitor	I've been there; I've seen it; I fixed it. Without a try, missy.
12207	Elliot	Thank you!
12208	Janitor	Oh, for what? For doing my job? Come on! This kind of thing gets me up in the morning. That, and the smell of urinal cakes.
12209	Janitor	Anyway, I'll see you around! Have a good one!
12210	Elliot	Back at'cha!

12216	Turk	D.R.K.? Dr. Kelso!
12217	***Fantasy/Surreal Sequence	Dr. Kelso toddles through the hospital like a video-game character, making little "wocka-wocka-wocka" noises punctuated by the occasional score-improving "plblbling!"

12220	J.D.	Hey, Dr. Cox.
12221	Dr. Cox	Oh, hey, buddy! I was just thinking about you! Yeah, I was thinking how it might be real nice to have somebody around here who could help me out. You know, somebody I could call oh, gosh "My Resident"...and we'd do stuff together. You know, medical stuff. And it would just be peaches! But then it occurred to me that a guy who looked a hell of a lot like you used to be that guy.
12222	J.D.'s Thoughts	Just do it!
12223	J.D.	I'm sorry...did you say something?

12226	Stage One	The jaw-clench. Arrrrrrrrggggggggghhhhhhhh!
12227	Pete	Quickly followed by Stage Two: Syllable elongation.
12228	Dr. Cox	Newbie, I re-he-heally don't have time to repeat myself!
12229	Pete	Finally, Stage Three: Dr. Cox begrudgingly offers a little respect, but then distances himself by overusing the word "there."
12230	Dr. Cox	But, I gotta give it to you, there, for yanking my chain, there. There!
12231	Pete	The young soldier is offered a prize for his courage.
12232	Dr. Cox	I'll tell you what, there, Newbie: If you want to stick around and help me out with Mrs. Riley's pericardiocentesis after work, that'd be great.
12233	J.D.'s Narration	I knew this was his way of reaching out, but still....
12234	J.D.	I have plans tonight.
12235	Dr. Cox	Oh, what plans!?
12236	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, think of something believable. Grandma died! No, no, no, no, don't do that...because if she does die, you'll feel awful; and, let's face it, she's no spring chicken. I should call her. But then, whenever we talk, I have nothing to say how 'bout asking me how I am for once!

12253	J.D.	Three-day weekend!
12254	Pete	Three-day weekend! Columbus day! That's coming up, right? Come on!

12262	J.D.	Hey, Dr. Cox? Look, I'm so sorry I lied to you last night. I should've just told you I was getting a beer with Pete.

12264	J.D.	Look, I know that he's in private practice and everything, but Pete's actually a really cool guy.
12265	Dr. Cox	He is a bad guy; and Newbie, if you're smart, you'll stay away from him.
12266	J.D.	Ohhh, my God! You're actually jealous that I'm hanging out with another doctor!
12267	Dr. Cox	No, I'm _not_.

12315	Dr. Cox	Would you like to know what would be seriously good for you?
12316	Pete	More bran in my diet?
12317	Dr. Cox	No, how 'bout you never mention Jordan again.

12325	Carla	Mr. Hilliard, I like my body.
12326	Mr. Hilliard	Okay.
12327	Carla	I didn't always. I remember when I was ten years old, my swim coach telling me that my butt stuck out of the water too much. But now? I like it when my boyfriend looks at my wagon and goes "BAM!" you know? I'm okay with my curves! I realize women inject God-knows-what into their face to have lips like mine! Mr. Hilliard! I can hop out of the shower and look at my naked body for a whole ten seconds without totally losing it that's more than most women! But, still, when I can't make you fall asleep, it's like hearing my swim coach's voice all over again; and my body doesn't deserve that.
12328	Mr. Hilliard	So, what do you want me to do?
12329	Carla	Fall asleep.
12330	Mr. Hilliard	I'm not attracted to you!
12331	Carla	WHY!?!
12332	Mr. Hilliard	Because you remind me of my sister!

12339	Dr. Cox	You went ahead and took something that did not belong to you.
12340	J.D.'s Thoughts	That seemed a little possessive...but I'm flattered!
12341	Dr. Cox	And worse than that, you did it knowing full-well just exactly how I felt about her.
12342	J.D.'s Thoughts	Ahh, he just wouldn't be Dr. Cox if he didn't refer to me as a 'her.'
12343	Pete	Hey, for what it's worth, I didn't make the first move.
12344	J.D.	That's a lie! You bought me a latte!
12345	J.D.	Hey, guys.
12346	Dr. Cox	We were having problems. Problems that you knew all about because I confided in you. And what did you do with the information? You used it to get Jordan into bed, didn't you. Didn't you!
12347	Pete	Perry, come on.
12348	Dr. Cox	Go.

12372	J.D.	That you're allowed to talk?
12373	Dr. Cox	I never blamed Jordan. I was a chief resident, I was here all the time, and I always made damn-sure she knew she came second. But, God almighty, I'm trying harder this time. I just hope I'm doing the right thing, you know?
12374	J.D.'s Thoughts	Who cares if Jordan wants to keep it a secret? Tell him it's his baby! Scream it from the mountains!
12375	J.D.	DR. COX!
12376	Jordan	Oh, there you are!
12377	Dr. Cox	Hey, babe.
12378	Jordan	Hi, handsome. How are you?
12379	Jordan	Oh! Hello, D.J.
12380	J.D.	Hey, Jordan. How' ya doin'?
12381	Dr. Cox	Oh!
12382	J.D.'s Narration	Around here, you have to grab hold of the littlest victories.
12383	J.D.'s Narration	Whether it's victories over your insecurities....
12384	Turk	Doc-Doc-Dr. Kelso?
12385	J.D.'s Narration	...or security's victories over you.
12386	Turk	Dr. Kelso!
12387	J.D.'s Narration	Either way, you gotta choose your battles.
12388	J.D.	I want you to tell her the truth, dammit. All right? Tell her that you're a surly, devious, horrible excuse for a human being!
12389	J.D.	Who's that?
12390	Janitor	It's my son.
12391	Elliot	Oh, my God, J.D.!
12392	J.D.	I-I'm sorry. I di no, I didn't even see him there, I
12393	Janitor	No, no, no, I'm...I'm glad he heard it. I think it's important he sees how the world treats people like us.
12394	J.D.	I'm so sorry.
12395	Janitor	Who the hell are you? Go on, beat it.
12396	Janitor	Scram!
12397	Janitor	...All right, stick around.
12398	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12399	J.D.'s Narration	Maybe it's because spring is around the corner, but lately it feels like romance is in the air.
12400	J.D.	How's that?
12401	Turk	You close your eyes way too early. And you always go in right; you should try going in left the girls'll dig that.
12402	J.D.	Okay. Fo'shizzle. What's up, girl.
12403	Carla	Aw, there's nothing in life that dog could have done to deserve that.
12404	Turk	What you talking about? My man's single, he's just running drills to keep his stuff sharp. That's all.
12405	Carla	Ohhh.
12406	J.D.	Also, it would be super fantastic if you never mention this to anyone, ever.
12407	Turk	Are you crazy? You know she's gonna say something. We're talking about Carla, here!
12408	Carla	So now I'm a gossip?
12409	Turk	Yeah, you're a gossip! You gossip all the time!
12410	Carla	Since when?
12411	Turk	Since ever forever!
12412	Carla	To who?
12413	Turk	To everybody!
12414	J.D.'s Narration	It's weird, ever since they got engaged, Turk and Carla have been arguing constantly.
12415	J.D.	You want some kibble?
12416	J.D.'s Narration	I guess I always hoped that, the longer you're a couple, the easier it got....
12417	Jordan	No. Noise. And, by the way, the whole world gets it you love your body. Now put your damn shirt on; no one's making a calendar, here. Oh, and be a sweetie and get me a juice, will ya? Thanks so much.
12418	Dr. Cox	As much as it may seem like it to me, personally, I feel desperately compelled to remind you that we are in fact _not_ in prison. And I am just so not your bitch!
12419	Jordan	Watch your language in front of the baby!
12420	Dr. Cox	You're gonna have to trust me on this one: Seeing as you're his mother, he's gonna hear that word early, and he's gonna hear it often. Like...non-stop!
12421	J.D.'s Narration	Maybe the truth is that it's easier to be a new couple, because you can't really see what's ahead of you.
12422	Elliot	Tonight, I am going to make all of your fantasies come true.
12423	Paul	You know, Elliot, I would be happy just to have sex _above_ the covers once.
12424	Elliot	Yeah...never gonna happen. Now, follow my voice to the bedroom....over here!
12425	Paul	You're in trouble tonight!
12426	Paul	Oh! Oh! Oh, my God! Oh!
12427	Elliot	Don't take the blindfold off! I'll, uh, I'll get a towel to stop the bleeding!
12428	J.D.'s Narration	In the end, the safest thing for a couple is to find a routine and stick with it.
12429	Dr. Kelso	Ted, have you noticed how happy all the minions are lately?
12430	Lawyer	I wish I was dead.
12431	Dr. Kelso	Yep. People love working here! Good morning, sweetheart!
12432	Nurse	Ugh.
12433	J.D.'s Thoughts	Honestly, it all makes me glad I'm on my own. I really don't think I'd have it any other
12434	J.D.	Hello, ladies. Just window shopping, or would you like to try something on?
12435	Nurse	Uh, aren't you the guy that makes out with dogs?
12436	J.D.	Carla...a quick word?
12437	J.D.	Is anybody else a doctor?
12438	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12439	Dr. Cox	I need you to extubate the young fellow in 304 and start an insulin drip on Mrs. Adler for the third time this month God bless diabetics who continue to drink oh, and Lassie! In response to the bestiality rumors circulating about you, I've decided to forgo calling you by the usual girl's name and instead I'm gonna be referring to you by whatever famous dog I can think of. I've gone with "Lassie" because, of course, that satisfies the criteria of being both a girl _and_ a dog's name, thus helping you ease into the transition.
12440	J.D.	I was just running kissing drills.
12441	Dr. Cox	Ohhh! That's completely normal, then!
12442	Nurse Roberts	Don't bring that filth over here.
12443	Turk	Dude! T.C.W.'s back.
12444	J.D.'s Narration	T.C.W. is a horrible story.
12445	J.D.'s Narration	She was married for three weeks before her husband got in a car accident and became a total vegetable. He's been on life support for the last two years; and since he was transferred to our hospital a month ago, she's visited every Wednesday. Very, very sad.
12446	J.D.'s Narration	Oh, yeah, and she's a babe! We call her "Tasty Coma Wife" or "T.C.W." for short.
12447	T.C.W.	How's he doing?
12448	J.D.	You know...he's he's the same. How are you doing?
12449	T.C.W.	Actually, I was just calculating how much time I need to spend here so I don't feel guilty all week.... And now I need to double it, because I can't believe I just said that.
12450	J.D.	I think you're allowed to do whatever you want, Mrs. Moyer.
12451	T.C.W.	Please, call me Jamie.
12452	J.D.	"Jamie"?
12453	Jamie	Mm-hmm.
12454	J.D.	Okay.
12455	Jamie	You have something on your cheek.
12456	J.D.	What is it?
12457	Jamie	Here.
12458	J.D.	Workin' in a hospital...it's always...something.
12459	Jamie	Yeah, I get it.
12460	J.D.	Oh. Did you get it?
12461	Jamie	No, not yet.
12462	Dr. Kelso	How we doin' today?
12463	J.D.	Oh! We're excellent, sir. No one going to hell in here!
12464	Dr. Kelso	Super!
12465	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12466	Turk	Baby. You've always known about my sleep toots. Hell, you used to imitate the sound they made, remember?
12467	Nurse Roberts	I make Mr. Roberts wear special air-tight boxer shorts.
12468	Turk	Laverne, I wrote the guest list for this conversation, and just in case, if you're wondering, you're not on it. Okay? So just umn-jun-humn.
12469	Dr. Cox	Hey, Carla, would you be good enough to take this young gentleman back to his room in Pediatrics? Apparently as a form of social protest, he chewed on and subsequently swallowed part of a Rolling Stones CD. I'll tell you what, there, Ralphie: They sold out for good once they started doing Ford commercials, you know what I'm saying?
12470	Ralphie	Hm?
12471	Carla	Mm-mm.
12472	Dr. Cox	We we'll talk later.
12473	Carla	Come on, Ralphie.
12474	Ralphie	I had that inside of me.
12475	Nurse Roberts	What, now?
12476	Carla	He's just making stuff up. Come on.
12477	Ralphie	I swallowed that ring, and my dad had to wait for me to go Number Two. And the black doctor gave me ten bucks to keep my mouth shut.
12478	Nurse Roberts	Mm. Good show today.
12479	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12480	Elliot	Ohhhh....
12481	Turk	Elliot! A blindfold! Way to step it up, Miss Nasty!
12482	Elliot	Hm. You told him what happened.
12483	Paul	We were bonding.
12484	Elliot	Mm...
12485	Paul	What are you eating?
12486	Elliot	Turkey jerky. Protein, baby! Go for it.
12487	Paul	Uh, no thanks.
12488	Elliot	You don't like jerky?
12489	Paul	I've never tried jerky.
12490	Turk	You've never tried jerky?
12491	Elliot	Well, jerky rocks.
12492	Paul	I won't like it.
12493	Elliot	You'll love it have one bite.
12494	Paul	Elliot, I've put a lot of thought into this, and I'm gonna have to pass.
12495	Elliot	Uh! Oh, so, eight stitches, and now you don't trust me.
12496	Paul	Elliot!
12497	Elliot	And you wanted above-the-covers sex.
12498	Turk	I feel your pain.
12499	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12500	J.D.'s Thoughts	Luckily, I'm a competent enough doctor that I'm not gonna let myself get distracted thinking about Jamie.
12501	Patient	Can you really hear my heart if it if it isn't in your ears?
12502	J.D.	Did _you_ go to med school?
12503	Patient	No, I...I...I No, I mean
12504	J.D.	No, you didn't. Thank you.
12505	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, the problem is that I'm in a rut. I just need someone to go out and get a beer with me.
12506	Elliot	I can't tonight!
12507	Lawyer	If I have more than one beer, I'll most likely kill myself.
12508	Carla	Can't. You seen Turk?
12509	Dr. Kelso	Married!
12510	Turk	Sorry, buddy, can't swing it tonight.
12511	J.D.	Oh, come on, player, just a few beers! And if we accidentally run into some skanky hos, then so be it!
12512	Jamie	I'll go.
12513	Jamie	I totally need to blow off some steam. Plus, the best way to meet skanky hos is to already have a girl with you.
12514	J.D.	Not that I need any help.
12515	Turk	Pff! Hell no!
12516	J.D.	Heh.
12517	Turk	You got something right....
12518	J.D.	Oh?
12519	Turk	Yeah, yeah.
12520	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12521	Dr. Cox	Oh, my God. I gotta tell you about that day.
12522	Jordan	I can't believe I haven't named him yet. I've been calling him Monkey Face all day I think they would tease him at school.
12523	Dr. Cox	Seriously, Jordan, I had this one patient
12524	Jordan	He's got a boodgie the size of a grape in his nose. Would you run back to the hospital and get me one of those suctiony thingies?
12525	Dr. Cox	If I'm not back in twenty minutes, I don't want you to worry because it simply means I drove by a prostitute on the way home.
12526	Jordan	Oh, make sure it's a girl.
12527	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12528	Paul	Please don't do this.
12529	Elliot	Do what?
12530	Paul	The whole drama queen thing.
12531	Elliot	The jerky incident is exactly what is wrong with our relationship, Paul!
12532	Paul	Thank you.
12533	Paul	Ow! Every lunch, someone hits me with a spit-ball.
12534	J.D.'s Thoughts	I'm still not sure how I feel about Paul and Elliot.
12535	J.D.'s Thoughts	Uh-oh....
12536	J.D.	Nice day, huh?
12537	Janitor	You always gotta have something to say, don't ya? Old nosy nelly, always gotta throw his two cents in.
12538	J.D.	O...kay, I'm I'm sorry about the "nice day" thing. How can I make this right?
12539	Janitor	What's it, uh, biscuit and gravy day?
12540	J.D.	Yeah.
12541	Janitor	Just give me one of them biscuits.
12542	J.D.	I thought you were ready.
12543	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12544	Jamie	So, how does this whole wing-man thing work?
12545	J.D.	Okay, essentially, you have to think of yourself as chum, okay?
12546	Jamie	Okay.
12547	J.D.	And your job as chum is to lure attractive women closer to the boat.
12548	J.D.'s Thoughts	Mental note: "The Boat" could be a very cool new nickname.
12549	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12550	Jamie	Hey, baby! Would you like some of this?
12551	J.D.	All right.
12552	Jamie	Look at that mmm.
12553	J.D.	No, no, Jamie. A little
12554	Jamie	Yeah?
12555	J.D.	a little aggressive! Sorry.
12556	Jamie	Did you like her?
12557	J.D.	No, no, no.... Her ass was way too perfect.
12558	Jamie	I can't believe I'm actually having fun!
12559	J.D.	I'm glad!
12560	Jamie	So, "Tasty Coma Wife," huh?
12561	J.D.	Oh, yeah, I'm sorry; I've heard some idiots call you that.
12562	Jamie	I kinda like it.
12563	J.D.	I thought it up.

12570	Ralphie	Because it was in my butt!
12571	Turk	Ralphie, I'm dead serious: I want you to shut up! And you shut your mouth, now!
12572	Carla	Would you wear this!?
12573	Turk	Baby! Please! Look, I've had this steam-cleaned, like, three times! Not only would I wear it, I'll put it in my mouth.
12574	Carla	What?
12575	Ralphie	It's fun to eat things!

12577	Dr. Cox	Oh, ho, ho, ho, Scooby! A married woman whose husband is still in a coma? Hoo, hoo! Can't tell you how many happy couples I know who got started just that way.
12578	J.D.	Oh, will you relax...we just got a beer. Whatta you got there?
12579	Dr. Cox	One hundred free booger suckers and you'll say nothing.
12580	J.D.'s Narration	People in relationships are always quick to dole out advice, even though they're usually the ones that are messed up.
12581	Paul	See ya, Elliot.
12582	J.D.'s Narration	Whether they're considering breaking up over a Slim Jim...
12583	J.D.'s Narration	...or having their stomach pumped...
12584	Turk	Ahhhhhhhh!
12585	J.D.'s Narration	...or just desperately trying to get some attention.
12586	Dr. Cox	Oh.
12587	J.D.'s Narration	So, I'm not gonna sweat it just because I made a new friend, you know? I mean, what's the big deal?
12588	Jamie	Hey!

12590	Jamie	May I come in?
12591	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12592	J.D.	He likes you!
12593	Jamie	He must smell my dead dog.
12594	Jamie	So, you still haven't asked me why I called the hospital, pretended to be your sister, got your home address, and showed up in the middle of the night.
12595	J.D.	Jamie, you've got a lot going on right now. I'm sure you're...a little confused....
12596	Jamie	It's time for me to start my life over. And I would love to take you out to dinner, if you would be interested.
12597	J.D.'s Thoughts	Holy crap!
12598	Jamie	Jack wouldn't want my life to be over.
12599	J.D.	Jack?
12600	Jamie	My husband.
12601	J.D.	Mr. Moyer!
12602	Jamie	Call him Jack.

12605	J.D.	Of course.

12626	J.D.	"Chink!"
12627	J.D.	Oh, no, no. No, Franklyn, we were we were, um, we were doing a crossword puzzle, and....
12628	Franklyn	I always suspected.

12633	Dr. Cox	Okay, Mrs. Brady, we're gonna try to break up your kidney stone with Lithotripsy. In the meantime, we're gonna put you on Percocet for the pain.

12635	Dr. Cox	Ohh, you like milk, do ya? Hah. Why don't you get on your bike and go down to the store and get some.
12636	J.D.'s Narration	I think at a certain point, breast-feeding becomes creepy.

12641	Justin	Mom!
12642	Dr. Cox	Benji, come.
12643	Dr. Cox	What is with these mothers doting on their children? My God! It's like...it's like nobody else even exists in the world anymore! But I tell you one thing and you damn sure take it to the bank my mother never paid that much attention to me.
12644	J.D.	It doesn't show.
12645	Dr. Cox	Word to the wise, there, Astro: Sarcasm does not sit well with the Big Dog, so consider this a warning. Because the next time I hear you mumble some snarky little passive-aggressive aside, I'm going to look into your heart, pick out your greatest insecurity, and shine the world's brightest spotlight on it for the remainder of your natural-born days. Now, riddle me this, Fido: Just exactly why does every Asian person who's passing us by in the hallway, here, keep giving you the old stink-eye?
12646	J.D.	Oh, you're imagining things.
12647	Dr. Cox	Oh.
12648	J.D.	Ow.
12649	J.D.	It's just been sorta hard for me lately, you know? I don't really have anyone special in my life, and...I'm pretty much either here or at home doing nothing, and....
12650	Jack	Yeah, that's rough.... I'm in a coma! I've had an itch on my foot for the last eight months!
12651	Elliot	What are you doing?
12652	J.D.	What? No nothing. It's a...new therapy.
12653	Elliot	Oh.
12654	Elliot	J.D., you'd trust me on something that was important to me, right?
12655	J.D.	'Course.
12656	Elliot	See? That's what I'm looking for! Huh?
12657	Paul	Elliot! We're talking about dried meat, here! Why would you get in the middle of this?
12658	J.D.	I don't know what I was thinking.
12659	Paul	Is that a straw in your pocket?
12660	J.D.	No, this is just a...pen. "Pink scrubs"....

12664	Turk	Ohh, you think that's funny, huh, Ralphie? Pay me my ten dollars!
12665	Dr. Kelso	Son, a hospital staff is like a melting pot! We all need to respect each other. Now, if you think that a specific ethnic group is loud or lazy or sneaky....
12666	J.D.	Or ridiculously closed-minded and inappropriate....
12667	Dr. Kelso	Exactly! ...Just keep it to yourself, dammit!
12668	Dr. Kelso	What?
12669	Janitor	Oh, nothing, sir. I just I thought of something funny.
12670	Dr. Kelso	Well, maybe what you should do instead is saddle up your mop and head upstairs someone has vomited in the second, third, and fifth floor hallways.
12671	J.D.	What? It's not my fault! Ralphie! Let's ride.
12672	J.D.	Good work, buddy. Here's your twenty bucks. So you can really throw up whenever you want to?
12673	Ralphie	Hell, yeah!
12674	J.D.	We should probably look into that.... You know, right after you blow chunks in the elevator.
12675	Jamie	Hey, stranger!
12676	Ralphie	Hot!
12677	J.D.'s Thoughts	It's weird realizing that you missed someone you barely know.

12694	J.D.	Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! And shut up! Okay? Who are you people to give me advice about anything? All you do is just bitch about your relationships all day long!

12696	J.D.	Ugh!
12697	Nurse Roberts	Did I miss something good?

12699	Jamie	Thank you so much for dinner.
12700	J.D.	You're welcome.
12701	Jamie	But what was the deal with tipping twenty dollars on a thirty dollar bill?
12702	J.D.	Ah, nothing. I just I love Chinese food...and...the Asian people! What should we do now?
12703	Jamie	...Kiss me.
12704	J.D.	I could do that.
12705	Jamie	Mm! You went left! Very cool.
12706	J.D.'s Thoughts	Thank you, Rowdy!
12707	Jamie	So, it's cold outside you wanna come back to my place?
12708	J.D.	Uhh.... Honestly, I think you you might be moving a little fast for yourself. And there's a part of me that's very angry I just said that.
12709	Jamie	I'm so sick of being alone, you know?
12710	J.D.	I'll tell you what, if you look me in the eyes and you tell me that you're really ready to start something right now....we won't even need a cab I will, like, I will throw you over my shoulder and just sprint the twelve miles to your house!
12711	J.D.	...But....
12712	Jamie	I'll call you sometime.
12713	J.D.	I hope you do.
12714	Jamie	Bye.
12715	J.D.'s Narration	I don't think people are meant to be by themselves.
12716	J.D.'s Narration	That's why, if you actually find someone you care about...
12717	J.D.'s Narration	...it's important to let go of the little things.
12718	J.D.'s Narration	...Even if you can't let go all the way.
12719	J.D.'s Narration	Because nothing sucks more than feeling all alone...no matter how many people are around.
12720	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12721	J.D.'s Narration	One thing that never changes around here is the stupid idea that the surgeons are all cool and the medical residents are all geeks.
12722	Elliot	Hey!
12723	J.D.	Ohhh, Rudy, can you lose the grapefruit goggles?
12724	Rudy	But it squirts in my eyes.
12725	J.D.	Well, that's a risk you take with that particular piece of fruit.
12726	J.D.	You guys, come on! What do you say we dial down the whole power-nerd thing a little bit, okay?
12727	Elliot	Hey, J.D., are you starting your surgical elective tomorrow?
12728	J.D.	Ohh, is that tomorrow?
12729	Elliot	Yeah!
12730	J.D.	Whatever. I don't really give a crap.
12731	J.D.	Take a picture! Take a picture!! And you better smile this time.
12732	Carla	You guys look so cute!
12733	J.D.	Hey, um, Carla, do you think you could cut these for me? Because I've been working out so much, these things are choking off my pythons , you know?
12734	Turk	Yeah, I wouldn't do that. At the end of the week, you gotta return these bad boys to, uh, Janeane!
12735	J.D.	Janeane's built like a bear. She curled me once.
12736	J.D.'s Narration	Entering the hospital as a surgeon has a whole different feel to it.
12737	***Fantasy Sequence	Two nurses rip off their scrubs, revealing tight, practically non-existent little outfits.
12738	Turk	Dude. You okay? You're acting weirder than the time we saw Pat Benetar at StarBucks.
12739	J.D.	How amazing was that morning....
12740	Turk	Listen, do me a favor: don't try to overdo it with these guys, all right? Just be you, okay?
12741	J.D.	Come on, man
12742	Turk	Be yourself.
12743	J.D.	you know how I do!
12744	J.D.	What's up, fellas. Look, I know I'm usually Medical, I just want you guys to know I consider you all me pee-pees.
12745	J.D.'s Thoughts	They know you mean "peeps"! Just change the subject!
12746	J.D.	Whoa! Somebody's been working out!
12747	Surgeon	What?
12748	J.D.	Help me!
12749	Elliot	Dr. Cox
12750	Dr. Cox	Work! I hate you! You suck!
12751	Elliot	I know, but I've been trying harder lately
12752	Dr. Cox	Barbie: Talking to the computer. But nice self-esteem.
12753	Paul	Hey, cowboy
12754	Paul	how 'bout you back off the little lady, and we'll all agree that you're really, really scary.
12755	Dr. Cox	Listen, there, Flowers: I know that your pink scrubs are balled up at the base of Barbie's bed three nights a week and congrats on that, really but if you're gonna go ahead and have a show-down with everyone who hassles her, then, gosh, you two aren't gonna have any time for that sweet, Aryan sex that you love so much!
12756	Elliot	Come on! Let's go!
12757	Dr. Cox	Why have we never fixed or replaced this monstrosity?
12758	Nurse Roberts	You know the deal around here if it barely works, it's not gonna get replaced.
12759	Dr. Cox	Well, I guess that explains why your ass is still on the payroll, huh? Ohhhhhhhhhhhh! Somebody stop me!
12760	Dr. Kelso	Morning, sport.
12761	J.D.	Morning, Captain.
12762	J.D.	So, am I the first guy they've done this to?
12763	Turk	Nah, man! They did this to Frank Fratchman.
12764	J.D.	Who's Frank Fratchman?
12765	Turk	Okay, you're the first one.
12766	J.D.	Help me!
12767	Turk	Yeah.
12768	J.D.	Ow!
12769	Turk	All right, don't sweat it, okay? Stay on your toes.
12770	J.D.	Okay.
12771	Dr. Cox	Sorry girls! Dropped my computer....yeah.
12772	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
12773	Turk	You just gotta remember when surgical residents sense insecurity, they attack.
12774	J.D.	I'll watch out for that.
12775	Turk	Dude, your face. Your face.
12776	J.D.	Ohhhh, man!
12777	Turk	Yeah, let's lose the tail, too.
12778	J.D.	Huh! How did they get that on there, dawg?
12779	Turk	Buddy I got your back
12780	J.D.	Oooooo!
12781	Turk	but lay low for a while.
12782	J.D.	No problem. All right, people, how long till we get this thing started?
12783	Turk	Probably not for a few minutes.

12785	Elliot	Hey, should I file my Bel Biv Devoe CD under 'B' for "Bel Biv" or under 'D' for "Devoe"?
12786	Paul	You know, I don't know why you let Dr. Cox push you around like that.
12787	Elliot	Hey, do you notice that you're always telling me what to do? I mean, in a good way.
12788	Paul	Uh-uh!
12789	Elliot	Then, how come I'm growing my bangs out _and_ wearing a thong?
12790	Paul	Because you look better without the bangs. And the thong, well, that's not up to me that's the law, missy!
12791	Elliot	Yeah, not now. You know that I don't like kissing while I'm alphabetizing.
12792	Paul	Right. Just so you know, I'm not folding my clothes before we do it tonight.
12793	Elliot	Yes you are.
12794	Paul	Hey, Elliot, I just want to tell you that the last few weeks have been really, really amazing.
12795	Elliot	Thanks.
12796	Elliot	I love U2.

12806	Dr. Kelso	Ted, you're a simpleton!

12811	Dr. Kelso	Can you explain this!?
12812	Dr. Cox	It appears to be a wiring problem! Either way, the second floor desperately needs a new computer.
12813	Dr. Kelso	Jackass!

12821	Turk	Told you I'd hook you up.
12822	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, my God.... Here, it's my first day in surgery, and I'm actually holding a human heart!
12823	J.D.	We we were done with that one, right guys?
12824	J.D.	What'cha got there?
12825	Janitor	A new circular saw just bought it! Four horse-power, thirty-five hundred RPMs, titanium finger guard....
12826	J.D.	Why would you need a saw in a hospital?
12827	Janitor	Why would an old hen need a banjo?
12828	J.D.	Why _does_ an old hen need a banjo?
12829	Janitor	Why would I buy a saw if I didn't have stuff to cut?
12830	J.D.	You wouldn't! That'd be crazy.
12831	Janitor	Exactly!
12832	Janitor	Need some help with that?
12833	J.D.	No thank you, I'm fine.

12836	Elliot	I was talking about U2, the _band_! You know what, it's fine. He probably thinks I was just saying it the way that you would say "I love eggs." You know, I'm sure there is not gonna be a problem.
12837	Carla	Okay!
12838	Lawyer	Uh, we have a telegram from Nurse Paul Flowers That name is funny!
12839	Lawyer	Uh, this is my band.

12853	J.D.'s Narration	Still, even though Turk was trying to help, I felt like such an outsider.
12854	Surgeon	I can't believe my girlfriend's dragging me to the ballet tonight.
12855	Todd	Oh, your girlfriend
12856	Surgeon	Yeah...
12857	Todd	or your _boyfriend_?
12858	Todd	Hahaha! Whazzup!

12867	Dr. Kelso	How about "handsome"? Or "glorious"?
12868	Dr. Cox	And this...abomination is the reason we can't afford a new computer?
12869	Dr. Kelso	Well, that, and a little medical boondoggle I have to go to in Cleveland. And by "medical boondoggle" I mean "golf weekend." And by "Cleveland" I mean "Hawaii."
12870	Dr. Cox	Do you have any idea what people around here think of you?
12871	Dr. Kelso	I go to bed some nights wondering. And you know what happens to me, Perry? I fall asleep and I mean like a log, brother. Anyway, I have to go catch my bus to the airport. And by "bus" I mean "helicopter."

12876	Carla	You never explained that U2 thing, did you!
12877	Elliot	You know, I've been thinking about it, and maybe it's not such a bad thing that that happened! Right? I mean, things have been going really well between us, and maybe it was fate! I could've been looking at my Bel Biv Devoe CD and said, "I love Bel Biv Devoe" which I do, by the way. And I'm not ashamed of it.
12878	Carla and Elliot	"That girl is poison..."
12879	Carla	Elliot, look, I just think that if you guys are meant to get to this point, it'll happen...naturally.
12880	Elliot	You're right! "I love U2!" Dammit! Why do I always have to say every little thing that comes into my head!? Ugh, I really wish you wouldn't stand so close to me after you take your hummus break. See! I didn't need to say that!

12891	J.D.	Heeeeeeeeey!
12892	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes you just can't help but get caught up in the moment. And when that happens, you never know what you're gonna do.

12894	Dr. Cox	Oh, I'm afraid Dr. Kelso has passed away.

12909	Todd	J.D., are you even paying attention?
12910	J.D.	Oh, I'm sorry, Todd. Is it time to excise the tumor?
12911	Todd	No! It is time to realize that we are operating on a naked chick! We will high-five later!

12927	Turk	Dude, who the hell are you talking about?
12928	J.D.	Oh, yeah, we all went out last night, and I sorta made up some new nicknames for all the fellas. By the way, you're "Slappy-bag."
12929	Turk	You've lost it.
12930	J.D.	Come on! Slappy-bag!
12931	Turk	Don't call me "Slappy-bag"!

12971	J.D.	Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah? Not all surgeons are stupid, okay! Think-sack, here, went to Dartmouth!

12976	Dr. Cox	Hey, Bob-Cat, welcome back. Lookit, this whole thing was a joke that...admittedly got a little out of hand. And, in the meantime, this blank check oughtta cover the damage.
12977	Dr. Kelso	A _joke_? You think it's funny they already gave away my parking spot? You think it's funny that one of the surgeons paid his dwarf cousin, Lance, two-hundred dollars to show up at rounds and sing, "Ding-dong, Kelso's dead!"?
12978	Dr. Cox	And there it is.
12979	Dr. Kelso	There what is!?
12980	Dr. Cox	This whole "I don't care what people think about me" act? It's pretty convincing. But methinks there's a sad little cartoon boy living inside the hairy beast. And he's sad because, at the end of the day, he realizes that the only thing people think about is what an evil son-of-a-bitch he really is. See you later, Bobbigator.
12981	Dr. Kelso	Hey!

12987	Paul	You're right. Go ahead.
12988	Elliot	If you could just start me off, that'd be super.
12989	Paul	Just tell me we had a lot of fun together.
12990	Elliot	We did.
12991	Paul	And most of the time, you were really happy.
12992	Elliot	I was.
12993	Paul	And then say that you wished you were mature enough to sit down and talk to me about what was bothering you. 'Cause, even though I can be controlling sometimes, I really would've worked on it for someone as special as you.
12994	Elliot	You know, it's funny...when I said "I love you," it was an accident and I never really loved you at all.
12995	Paul	That is an absolute riot.

13013	J.D.	Med school chicks love ventriloquists!
13014	Puppet	He's right! They do!
13015	Hospital	J.D. is orange.
13016	J.D.	Tannest intern, baby! And it comes in a bottle!
13017	Bar	A few minutes ago.
13018	J.D.	Apple-tini, please. Easy on the -tini.
13019	Turk	See, J.D., the thing that I always liked about you was that you were just yourself you never cared about what people thought.
13020	J.D.	And that's why you hung out with me?
13021	Turk	No, you had a car. Still do.
13022	J.D.	Come on, player! You know I'm way more stud than dud!
13023	J.D.	Wow, you can really taste the apples!
13024	J.D.'s Narration	I think everyone would like to believe it's possible to become someone different.... To change how people see us.
13025	Dr. Cox	Haha! I told you he'd buckle! How's that new computer? Pretty good, huh?
13026	Carla	We wouldn't know this one's from, like, 1970.
13027	Dr. Cox	Well, what'd he do with the new one?
13028	J.D.'s Narration	But sometimes change doesn't last for long.
13029	Dr. Kelso	By golly, you're so pretty, I may not even use you!
13030	J.D.'s Narration	And other times, just makes you miss what you had.
13031	J.D.'s Narration	...a little.
13032	J.D.'s Narration	As for me, I'm happy just knowing who I am.
13033	Doug	Hey, J.D.? Do you have any nasal spray?
13034	J.D.	No problem, Dougster.
13035	Doug	Yeah!
13036	J.D.'s Thoughts	For I am John Dorian King of the Nerds!

13043	Jordan	I can't believe you're bitching 'cause I asked you to look after him for an hour three days a week! Do you know how badly I need a massage?
13044	Dr. Cox	What's the matter? Are you getting all sore around that hump above your butt where your tail used to be?
13045	Jordan	I'm going 'cause when Gustavo promises me something will feel great and last an hour, he doesn't end up in the shower five minutes later thinking he made me see God!
13046	Dr. Cox	So not Gustav! Busy doctor!
13047	J.D.'s Thoughts	I think Dr. Cox would be more willing to help if he knew it was his baby.
13048	***Fantasy Sequence	The baby's got Dr. Cox face. Really.
13049	Baby	Whatta you say, there, Stephanie; how about _you_ step up to the plate and tell the guy. My God! I'm only three weeks old, and already I've got more stones than you do and one of mine hasn't even dropped yet.
13050	J.D.	It's not my place to tell!
13051	Baby	Wah! Wah! Wah!
13052	Dr. Cox	Newbie, I know that your ovaries are absolutely tingling at the very sight of this little fella, but you gotta snap out of it!
13053	J.D.	Oh, I gotta get to that funeral.
13054	Dr. Cox	Well, raise my rent if you're not off to see Tasty Coma Wife, aren't you! Her husband was in a coma so long, that she actually forgot what an attractive male looked like enter Errol Flynn...whose conscience will not allow him to either swash or buckle her. But, since hubby is now worm food, I'm guessing all bets are off? Mm-hmm?
13055	Jordan	Listen, later on, if you have trouble getting the baby to sleep? Just tell him that story. Yeah.
13056	J.D.	Well...I'm gonna get going.
13057	J.D.'s Narration	Luckily, no one else'll bust my chops about the funeral. Because around here, you tend to get wrapped up in your own world.
13058	J.D.'s Narration	Whether you're trying to plan your day...
13059	Todd	Should I take a dookie before or after I lift weights? Mmmm....after!
13060	J.D.'s Narration	...or trying to live out your deepest fantasies.
13061	Janitor	Dammit! Don't you die on me! Clear! Kgh-bgghhhh!
13062	J.D.'s Narration	...Maybe you're trying to break in the soles of your new Italian shoes...
13063	Lawyer	Sir, those shoes look a little small for you.
13064	J.D.'s Narration	...or break down the spirit of your old whipping boy.
13065	Dr. Kelso	What do you know about appearances, Ted? Have you looked in a mirror?
13066	Lawyer	Not lately. But when I do, it's reflection perfection!
13067	J.D.'s Narration	One way or another, everyone finds a way to make it all about themselves.
13068	Nurse Roberts	I gotta fix my own damn copy machine 'cause the maintenance man claims he's got more important things to do!
13069	J.D.	Isn't he fixing the heat down in Pediatrics?
13070	Nurse Roberts	Whatever!
13071	J.D.'s Narration	As for me, no matter what Dr. Cox thinks, I wasn't going to that funeral to hit on Jamie....
13072	J.D.'s Narration	...I was going to pay my respects.
13073	Jamie	J.D.! I'm so happy you came!
13074	J.D.	Well, you look fantastic! And, you know, I don't mean "Hey, dude, check out that hot bitty at the bar!" 'fantastic' I'm talking about "I'm sorry for your loss" 'fantastic'.
13075	Jamie	Do you wanna grab a drink?
13076	J.D.	Yeah, let's get the hell out of here.
13077	Jamie	Oh, I was actually talking about him.
13078	J.D.	Oh, yeah, I know! So so was I.
13079	Jamie	Oh, no! You have to order he's bussing those.
13080	J.D.	Somebody's a smoker!
13081	Jamie	Heh.
13082	Carla	Awww...look at my baby sleep. Isn't he an angel? I wonder what's going on in that shiny head of his?

13088	J.D.'s Thoughts	Just get out without doing any more damage.
13089	J.D.	I had a blast.
13090	J.D.'s Thoughts	Nice job!
13091	Jamie	Well...goodbye....
13092	J.D.	I'll see ya.
13093	Todd	Whoops!
13094	J.D.	Oh! Oh! Heh. I'm sorry, everyone. I...I dropped something on my toe. "Ahhhhhh!...AHHAAAAHHHH!" ...You know.... Carry on.
13095	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13096	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, she's probably feeling awful, so say something reassuring.
13097	J.D.	You're going to hell.
13098	Jamie	J.D., we've been over this. I loved my husband, but he's been dead to me for two years. I mean, I can't tell you how happy I am to finally have some closure. ...And my first orgasm in, like, forever!
13099	J.D.	You know, Jamie, there are a lot of ways to grieve. Um.... But, last time I checked, wheelbarrow-style wasn't one of them.
13100	Jamie	I am okay, J.D. I'm really seeing things clearly.
13101	J.D.	You've never been more confused.
13102	Jamie	I'm happy!
13103	J.D.	You're sad.
13104	Jamie	I'm at peace.
13105	J.D.	You're at war!
13106	Jamie	I think it's really cute that you're worried about me. But when am I gonna see you again?
13107	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13108	Jordan	All right, I will see you at home in about an hour. Remember to keep him warm, support his head, check his diaper every fifteen minutes; no bouncing around, no loud noise, no TV, no poking the soft spot. And, Perry, you're the only one in my life that I actually have to say this to: Do not yell at, demean, insult, criticize, humiliate, or mock the baby.
13109	Dr. Cox	What are you talking about?
13110	Dr. Cox	Waaaah! Now, have you bothered to name this thing yet?
13111	Jordan	I'm thinking of naming him after my father.
13112	Dr. Cox	"Tax E. Vader"?
13113	Jordan	Quinn.
13114	Dr. Cox	What about a heterosexual name, like Jack?
13115	Jordan	You're right, Percival, "Quinn" is a foofy name.
13116	Dr. Cox	You know what, skip "Jack" altogether and just go with whatever you think is right whatever makes you comfortable.
13117	Dr. Cox	Jack-Jack-Jack-Jack-Jack-Jack-Jack-Jack-Jack...Jack!
13118	Dr. Cox	Nothin', huh? Aye-aye-aye.
13119	Dr. Cox	Oh!

13123	Turk	Yeah?
13124	Carla	Between my list of family and friends and your list of family and friends, we have like 400 people coming to this wedding! How are we gonna cut this down?
13125	Elliot	Out of curiosity, whose list did I end up on, yours or Turk's?
13126	Carla	Ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm..........mine!
13127	Elliot	Let me see!
13128	Carla	Nope!
13129	Elliot	Uh!
13130	Carla	I gotta go!
13131	Elliot	What's her problem? I'm starting to wonder if my prescription deodorant isn't working!
13132	Turk	Mm?
13133	Elliot	It's not for the odor, it's for the wetness. See!
13134	Turk	Whoa! Woman! Don't touch me!
13135	Elliot	You're right. I have got to stop touching my pits and rubbing them on people.
13136	Turk	Yes, you do! Still, it's not that.... I sorta had a sex dream about you.
13137	Elliot	Really?
13138	Turk	Yeah.
13139	Elliot	Was I the girl?
13140	Turk	Yeah, you were the girl! Can you just do me a favor, though? Don't tell Carla about this, because she'll just get all jealous and disgusted.
13141	Elliot	But...we haven't done anything for her to be disgusted by.
13142	Turk	Oh, yeah, we did.
13143	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13144	J.D.'s Thoughts	I'm gonna try not to call Jamie, because I know in my heart she shouldn't be in a relationship yet. But still, there were a lot of questions: Was she gonna be okay? Did I leave my underwear at the funeral home? And good Lord! how did I end up in the middle of nowhere without realizing I've never had to pee this badly in my entire life!?
13145	J.D.	Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
13146	J.D.	Uh! Oh!
13147	J.D.	Oh, my God!
13148	J.D.	Oh. My. God.
13149	Dr. Cox	So, you caught sight of the Janitor's window crank, and think you may have seen a little melanoma on there? Hmm! Well, then, it's your obligation as a doctor and your privilege as a woman to go back and ask him if you can't see it one more time. Now, 'course I'd love to help, but I'm off to baby-sit the only other being on God's green earth who's needier than you. And, in the meantime, I need you to go in and tell Mr. Mueller that his liver has lesions on it and it doesn't look good.
13150	J.D.'s Narration	Unfortunately, Mr. Mueller doesn't speak a word of English.
13151	J.D.	Hi, Mr. Mueller.
13152	Mr. Mueller	Warum so kalt hier?
13153	Subtitles	"Why is it so cold in here?"
13154	Mr. Mueller	Ich sollte eine Heizung dabei haben.
13155	Subtitles	"I should have a space heater."
13156	Mr. Mueller	...oder eine Brust Krankenschwester bei mir unter die Bettdecke.
13157	Subtitles	"...or a big chesty nurse to climb under the covers with me."
13158	Mr. Mueller	Danke! Nurse Roberts: What he "danke"in' you for?
13159	J.D.	I don't know. This is so frustrating! I just wish there was some way we could connect!
13160	***Fantasy Sequence	To the tune of Nena's "99 Luftballons", J.D. and Mr. Mueller dance amid that's right 99 red balloons.

13166	Dr. Cox	Yeah! Unfortunately, I'm not gonna be able to do this tomorrow on account of Kelso's got me doing a cardiology lecture.
13167	Jordan	Oh, don't worry about it.

13172	Turk	What the hell, Elliot!?
13173	Elliot	It slipped out! I'm sorry!
13174	Turk	Sorry's not good enough.
13175	Elliot	You're right.
13176	Elliot	Ohhh!
13177	Elliot	Oh! HARDER, DAMMIT! I've been bad.
13178	Surgeon	Dr. Turk.
13179	Turk	Huh?

13181	Turk	No, sir!
13182	Surgeon	The Todd will close.
13183	Turk	Dude, I'm freaking out! I can't stop having sex dreams about Elliot!
13184	Todd	Boi-oi-oi-oi-oing! All done. Continue.

13188	Janitor	Can I take your order?
13189	J.D.	How come you're not unzipped?
13190	Janitor	'Cause I'm not peeing! This is where I come to take my breaks. If I stand around out there, everyone tells me to do stuff.
13191	J.D.	Look, uh..........Janitor
13192	J.D.	I'm gonna be straight with you: I saw your penis, and I noticed a possible melanoma that you should really have checked out.
13193	Janitor	When did you see my penis?
13194	J.D.	Last night, when you were showering.
13195	Janitor	Where were you?
13196	J.D.	Oh, I was outside, in the bushes.
13197	Janitor	Uhhh....
13198	J.D.	Look, it was just a coincidence, man I mean, i-i-if you had looked out the window, you'd have seen my penis, you know!
13199	Janitor	What!?! Why?
13200	J.D.	Because I had it out while I was looking at yours!
13201	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, regroup.
13202	Hermann	Hey, you must be Dr. Dorian. I am, uh, Rolf's brother, Hermann.

13205	J.D.	Oh.
13206	Hermann	Let's hope it catches on!
13207	J.D.	Uh, well, uh, I could really use your help translating.
13208	Hermann	Oh, sure.
13209	J.D.	Uh, I got the, uh, results back from your biopsy...
13210	Hermann	Wir werden dich zu einem...
13211	J.D.	...the lesions in your liver...
13212	Hermann	Es sieht so aus, als ob du...

13218	J.D.	It's not good.
13219	Hermann	Es wird alles gut gehen.
13220	Hermann	Okay.
13221	J.D.'s Narration	The key to any good relationship is communication.
13222	Carla	Hi, Baby.
13223	Turk	Hey!
13224	J.D.'s Narration	If you're not open with someone, it's gonna catch up with you.
13225	Patient	This is so weird I could swear that while I was in surgery, I heard you describing these sexy dreams about someone named Elliot!
13226	J.D.'s Narration	If you're not honest, you'll end up getting busted.
13227	Dr. Cox	So, to summarize: If this basketball was a non ST-elevation myocardial infarction, Glycoprotein 2B3A inhibitors would be initiated early on....
13228	Dr. Cox	You buying this?
13229	Jordan	No. Can I see that?
13230	J.D.'s Narration	Eh, but what do I know about good relationships? Two days ago, I had funeral sex.
13231	Elliot	Hey! I just met your patient, Mr. Mueller; we had such a nice chat.
13232	J.D.	You speak German?
13233	Elliot	Yeah! I can do a sweet little milkmaid: Guten Morgen, möchten Sie die Kühe melken?
13234	Elliot	I can do an evil old hausfrau : ESS DEIN SCHNITZEL, SONST KRIEGST DU KEIN NACHTISCH! J.D.: German's such a beautiful language.... Anyhoo, I think Mr. Mueller's so amazing. I mean, yesterday, I pretty much told him he was gonna die; and his brother turned to him and he said, "Es wird alles wieder gut." And Mr. Mueller just accepted it!
13235	Elliot	Well, why wouldn't he? "Es wird alles wieder gut" means "You're going to be fine."
13236	J.D.	Germans!

13240	Elliot	He said, "As soon as I get home, I'm eating an entire chocolate cake."
13241	J.D.	You mind telling me why you lied to your brother about this ____ condition!?
13242	Hermann	You you talk too fast.
13243	Elliot	He said,
13244	Elliot	He didn't want to upset his brother, jackass!
13245	J.D.	Fine, just tell him that lying to his brother isn't gonna make him any better!
13246	Nurse Roberts	We got Mr. Mueller's ultrasound back.
13247	J.D.	His Biliary obstruction's relieved, and he's taking P.O.
13248	Hermann	That's good, yes?

13255	Dr. Kelso	Uh-huh, and speaking of crunching, I have been jonesing for some Double-Stuff Oreos all day. Why don't you see if you can't hook me up?
13256	J.D.	...And now, Mr. Mueller's doing so much better, I'm not even sure telling him the truth about his pancreatic cancer is even the best thing for him.
13257	Dr. Cox	So, what you're saying is that you have a problem that is totally your problem, but you'd like to find a way to make that problem my problem. But here's the problem, Newbie: it's not my problem. So whatta you say we stop talking about the Janitor's junk; I'd like to hear nahsing about ze German; and don't even mention Tasty Coma Wife, even though I know she's on your mind.
13258	J.D.	No she's not!
13259	***Fantasy	Jamie is on J.D.'s back.
13260	Jamie	Yes I am!
13261	Jamie	Waaagh!
13262	Dr. Cox	Well, since we are sharing: I have to go home and face Jordan and tell her that I didn't ditch her little hatchling on account of being lazy I did it because, whenever I'm alone with that child, do you know what I feel? Nothing.
13263	J.D.	No thanks.
13264	Dr. Cox	It was worth a try.
13265	Nurse Roberts	What was that about?
13266	Nurse Roberts	You're right, I'm sorry! I've been working really hard the past few months on not being such a busy-body.
13267	Carla	So, tell me, Turk, was she a good kisser?
13268	Turk	Uhhh....
13269	Nurse Roberts	Excuse me.
13270	Carla	Turk! If you're already having dreams about another woman, maybe you're not ready for marriage!
13271	Turk	Baby....
13272	Carla	Just take it!
13273	Carla	Are you crazy!? Baby, it was only a sex dream! Everybody has them...
13274	Carla	...right, Ted?
13275	Lawyer	Oh, no, not me...I just have the one dream over and over I hold his head under the water 'til that last bubble goes "bloop."

13282	Janitor	I don't like you.
13283	J.D.'s Narration	Not that I totally expected that.
13284	Janitor	...But, I know this was uncomfortable, and, uh, I appreciate your concern.

13288	Elliot	This is awkward.
13289	Turk	Yeah, Elliot, could you, uh, be quiet please?
13290	Elliot	Okay. But if it gets too quiet, you could just fall asleep, and then I might just creep into your head and rock your world! Unh!
13291	Turk	Elliot, you don't get it, do you? Look, ever since I met Carla, I haven't dreamt about another woman.
13292	Elliot	Turk! You're engaged. I mean, it's a huge commitment! It's totally natural to feel trapped or uncertain...maybe even a little scared?
13293	Turk	Really?
13294	Nurse Roberts	Uh-huh.
13295	Nurse Roberts	Sorry.
13296	Turk	Baby?
13297	Carla	Yeah?
13298	Turk	Have you dreamt of anyone since we got engaged?

13304	Dr. Cox	Jordan, I gotta...I gotta tell you something.
13305	Jordan	You know, I love my dad, but he just doesn't look like a "Quinn."
13306	Dr. Cox	Maybe that's because he's not drunk and yelling at your mother.
13307	Jordan	What are you? A "Kevin"? A "Billy"?
13308	Dr. Cox	Jack?
13309	Jordan	Wow. All right. Jack it is. What the hell! All right, you take him.

13319	J.D.'s Narration	It's funny how one person can lead you to another. I mean, I knew Mr. Mueller's brother shouldn't have tried to protect him, and yet I was doing the same thing to someone else.
13320	J.D.	Excuse me, Jamie?
13321	Jamie	J.D.? Wha ?
13322	J.D.	I treated a patient today who was mad at his brother for presuming to know what's best for him. And that got me thinking. Because I was freaking out that we hooked up in the closet at the funeral, I did the same thing to you! So...if you're really ready, let's go for it! 'Cause, I'm crazy about you, and you're right your husband's gone, and he's never coming back!
13323	Man	Uhh.
13324	J.D.	Who are these lovely people?
13325	Jamie	These are my late husband's parents.
13326	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, God. How can I make this right?
13327	***Fantasy Sequence	The restaurant is filled with red balloons, and J.D., Jamie, and her former in-laws happily dance to "99 Luftballons".
13328	J.D.'s Thoughts	If only....
13329	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13330	J.D.'s Thoughts	When you're dating a woman whose husband just died after two years in a coma, you can't help but have doubts about the relationship. I guess all you can do is be a man, and face those doubts head-on.
13331	Jamie	What are you thinking about?
13332	J.D.	Eggs. You know, one minute they're bad for you, now everybody's like, "Hey, have you tried eggs? Th-They-They're great!" It's c it's crazy. Every ...eggs are....
13333	Jamie	You know what? Forget I asked.
13334	J.D.	What?
13335	Jamie	J.D., I really wanted tonight to be romantic.
13336	J.D.	Sweetie, it is!
13337	J.D.	Now, exactly how much feeling am I supposed to lose in my extremities?
13338	Jamie	Just enough so it still hurts.
13339	J.D.'s Narration	Still, things are going pretty well with me and Jamie.
13340	Elliot	Looks like rope-burn to me.
13341	J.D.	Oh, no, this a a rash from my new watch. They didn't tell me the band was made out of....cat.
13342	Carla	Elliot, check out these wedding dresses.
13343	Turk	I am _so_ proud of you right now!
13344	Elliot	This is exactly like the dress I bought! Huh!
13345	J.D.	Hm?
13346	Elliot	Oh, I I didn't already buy a wedding dress. I mean, I'm not even dating anybody, so that would be crazy.... Whether it was half-off or not....
13347	Turk	Dude, there's not one good thing about her planning a wedding I can't afford.
13348	Carla	Turk, I know it's silly and I know it's only for one day but ever since I was a little girl, all I wanted to do was have a big, beautiful wedding.
13349	Turk	Baby! What's the name of that designer you love so much? She made that gown? Vera...
13350	Carla	"Wang."
13351	Elliot	Oh, my God. You're the only two doctors immature enough to laugh at the name "Vera Wang."
13352	Todd	Hello.
13353	Elliot	Go ahead.
13354	Todd	What? I think Vera Wang makes very beautiful gowns. Plus, her last name is a very funny word for "penis." Who's with me? Air-five! Stsh! Stsh! Stsh!
13355	J.D.	Shorts, huh?
13356	Janitor	Yeah. What, I don't get to wear shorts, 'cause I'm just a lowly janitor?
13357	J.D.	I didn't say "lowly."
13358	Janitor	Oh, so now I'm a janitor?
13359	J.D.	Yes! Have you been drinking?
13360	Janitor	I'm not _drunk_.
13361	J.D.	I love your shorts, okay? I wish I had a pair just like 'em.
13362	Janitor	Hm.
13363	Dr. Cox	Okay, Mr. Westfeld, now the angioplasty went well, but here's the thing: It is on you, pardner. You gotta start watching what you eat so that we can kick this thing in the ass. Okay?
13364	J.D.	It's on you, pardner!
13365	Dr. Cox	Oh, gosh, Shannon, thank you _so much_ for clarifying my point by repeating it word for word. And now, in a reciprocal gesture, can I be included in the planning of your coming out party?
13366	J.D.	Is that a gay joke?
13367	Dr. Cox	No, it's a cotillion joke. My God, Newbie, it's been two furiously frustrating years how is it possible that you still don't get me? I would never compare you to the gays! I like the gays I like their music, I like their sense of style, I especially like what they've done with Halloween but _our thing_ is that you are a _little girl_. That's who you are! But that's really not fair....
13368	J.D.'s Thoughts	Man, once Dr. Cox gets on a roll, there's nothing that can derail him.
13369	Dr. Cox	....is just impossible.
13370	Carla	My mom died.
13371	J.D.'s Thoughts	Except that.
13372	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13373	Carla	Thank you all for coming, I know you're busy.
13374	J.D.'s Narration	The toughest part about working in a hospital is that, no matter what else is going on in your life, you have to dive right back into the middle of things.
13375	Janitor	So, anyway, you said you liked mine, and I had the wife whip you up a pair of your own! You like 'em?
13376	J.D.	Do I like 'em? Why, just the other day, I was asking myself, "How can I display my package in a way that's both alluring and professional?"
13377	Janitor	Well, there's your answer!
13378	J.D.	Ugh.
13379	Janitor	HAH-HAH-HAH! Ahhh! To be young and in shorts!
13380	Jamie	Are you ready for bed?
13381	J.D.	Oh, I'm ready.
13382	J.D.'s Narration	A lot can change in a week.
13383	Jamie	Scoot.
13384	Jamie	Can you hand my mouth guard to me?
13385	J.D.'s Thoughts	Uh, ew.
13386	Jamie	Thanks.
13387	Elliot	J.D., if things have fizzled that much, I mean, I could scout her out for you, try to figure out the problem.
13388	J.D.	Things haven't fizzled, all right? Last night we made ice cubes out of orange juice, so step off!
13389	Lawyer	Okay, gang! Before we begin, Dr. Kelso wants me to remind you of the legal ramifications of all your teensy snafus.
13390	Dr. Kelso	"Teensy snafus"?!? Good God, Ted, it's not a Dr. Seuss story!
13391	Doug	It was a gusher!
13392	Dr. Kelso	Next catastrophe. ...Idiots!
13393	Doug	I hate him so much!
13394	Lawyer	Save it for our weekend bike ride.

13396	Nurse Roberts	Dr. Cox, would you like to try one of my world-famous deviled eggs?
13397	Dr. Cox	No, thank you, I've already had diarrhea.
13398	Dr. Cox	...It's always tough when you have to bury your own mom, isn't it?
13399	Carla	Mm-hmm. What was your mother's funeral like?
13400	Dr. Cox	Wouldn't know skipped it. But my aunt told my father it was very moving. Oh, gosh.
13401	J.D.'s Thoughts	Wow.... The past and the present.
13402	J.D.'s Narration	Whenever I see two beautiful women that I've been intimate with talking to each other, I always have the same fantasy....
13403	***Fantasy Sequence	Fred "Rerun" Berry is decked out in his supposedly trademark outfit of red trousers, yellow shirt, and beret. The girls are wearing similar, with the modification of skirts.
13404	Rerun	Come on, ladies! It's right hand, left hand, shoulder-pop, jump! Right hand, left hand, shoulder-pop, jump!
13405	J.D.	Mm!
13406	J.D.	What are you two talking 'bout?
13407	Elliot	_Not_ the Rerun Dance.
13408	J.D.'s Thoughts	I tell her way too much.
13409	Jamie	You left some stuff in my apartment.
13410	J.D.	Oh, thanks!
13411	Jamie	See ya.
13412	J.D.	Mmm....
13413	Elliot	You wanna know why things with Jamie are so 'lamey'?
13414	J.D.	We're doing fine!
13415	Elliot	Oh, please! She's clearing you out of her apartment!
13416	J.D.	Wrong! She just came by because she knows today at work, I need my......squash goggles.
13417	Elliot	Mm.
13418	J.D.	I have to saw something later.
13419	Elliot	She's a drama queen, J.D.! When her husband was in a coma, it was all, like, taboo and exciting; but now that it's okay for the two of you to be together, the relationship's got no snap...it's got no crackle. J.D.... It's got no pop. I know! Because I'm a drama queen, too!
13420	J.D.	Well, Jamie is not like you, okay!?
13421	Elliot	No Pop!
13422	J.D.	Ditditditdit!
13423	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13424	Dr. Cox	Nine pounds in a _week_!? Let me ask you a quick question: are you trying to make my head explode? Because you have no idea just how frustrating it is working your _ass_ off trying to inflate a tiny little balloon inside someone's clogged artery. And all that a person has to do, really, is oh, I don't know go for a walk in the morning or choke down a fresh green salad. And you come back here looking like that!?! And I know, I know, here I'm supposed to be Dr. Give A Crap, but you wanna know the God's honest truth? And this is a fact you are what you eat, and you clearly went out and devoured a big fat guy, didn'cha!
13425	Lawyer	See, Dr. Cox, this is, uh, the sort of hostile behavior that can cause us legal difficulty.
13426	Dr. Cox	Ted! I just might rip that tie off your neck and jam it down your esophagus.
13427	Lawyer	I think you proved at Nurse Roberts' above-ground pool party that that doesn't solve anything.
13428	Dr. Kelso	Dammit, Perry! You can't just go around brow-beating nut-jobs and bullying fatties!
13429	Dr. Cox	Well, I'm not a resident, so I'm not going to your lame-ass doctor-patient seminar.... So, in essence, there, Big Bob, there's really nothing you can do to me at all, is there!
13430	Dr. Cox	Hello, class. My name is Dr. Perry Cox.... I'm going to be your teacher.

13437	Turk	Just came to check on you.
13438	Turk	You looking at pictures?
13439	Carla	Yeah.
13440	Carla	I know she was...old. Still, she was my best friend. I mean, what are you supposed to do without your mom?
13441	Turk	You can let your man fill a little bit of the hole that she left.
13442	Carla	She would like that.
13443	Turk	Baby, she hated me.
13444	Carla	Yeah, she did.

13448	J.D.	Why are we whispering?
13449	Janitor	I wanted to see if you would whisper because I whispered.
13450	J.D.	I think I would.
13451	Janitor	Anyway, what's the deal? We're supposed to be shorts buddies today. You saw the schedule: Monday-Tuesday, shorts; Wednesday, we wash 'em; Thursday-Friday, shorts; weekend, optional I'll be wearing shorts.
13452	J.D.	Yeah, I know. I was gonna wear 'em, but you know someone went and stole them out of my locker!
13453	Janitor	What?
13454	J.D.	Yes!
13455	Janitor	Let me see!
13456	J.D.'s Narration	As a doctor, you get good at thinking on your feet. I was able to protect the Janitor's feelings, plus, he totally bought it!

13465	Jamie	You know what, I gotta get up kinda early, so maybe you should just crash at your place tonight.
13466	J.D.'s Thoughts	Look, she probably does have to get up early, so just be cool.
13467	J.D.	I'm so sorry! It was a total accident, I just...I just
13468	Jamie	Don't lie to me! I asked you to go, so you punched in my coffee table, didn't you.
13469	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, my God! She does want drama!
13470	J.D.	Sometimes you make me so crazy!
13471	Jamie	Come here. I'll take care of you.
13472	J.D.'s Thoughts	This is totally normal. I mean, in relationships, you have to roll with the punches! Even the ones you don't see coming....
13473	Turk	Carla, if there were anything I could do to make you feel better, I'd do it.
13474	Carla	Let's get married now.

13478	J.D.	Ahh, that is romantic. So, how pregnant is she?
13479	Turk	She's not pregnant!
13480	Turk	Man, I was getting really psyched for this whole wedding, man the dancing, the band, you woulda hooked up with one of Carla's sisters!
13481	J.D.	Really? Which one?
13482	Turk	The drunkest one.
13483	J.D.	Nice!
13484	Turk	Plus, now there's no bachelor party; and you being the Best Man, I _know_ you woulda hooked it up!

13487	Turk	Dude!
13488	J.D.	That woulda been awesome!
13489	Turk	I'm just having a hard time getting excited about all of this, you know what I mean?
13490	Chaplain	Well, you work here, so I guess we could do the whole ceremony for about forty bucks.

13502	J.D.	No, it was definitely that guy!

13505	J.D.	I don't know. How are you? Zinnnnng!

13530	Doug	Yes, Dr. Cox?
13531	Dr. Cox	if I were you, I'd go ahead and swallow that entire mouthful of baby carrots. Because, if I hear you make even one more damn crunch, I'm gonna use the remainder of the carrots in that bag to make you completely air-tight, son.

13561	Elliot	Uh-huh. And what does Jamie think you're doing over here?
13562	J.D.	Asking you not to show up at my apartment drunk, naked, and crying. You know what's weird? I really like this girl, but I'm not sure I can keep it going with all the drama.
13563	Elliot	I think you just have to gamble that once all the drama's gone, there's still gonna be something there. If not, it's her loss.

13571	Dr. Cox	Barbie, why did they toss you in here?
13572	Elliot	Oh, they didn't! I'm, uh...uh, I'm...auditing.
13573	Dr. Cox	Fine. Fine. Fine, fine, fine, fine. You wanna know the real skinny? If you want to be good doctors and nurses, you damn-sure better get ready to get in trouble a lot. Because patients are stupid, and they are really scared. And some of them need you to hold their hands, and you should. Others need you to kick their asses, and you absolutely should do that, too. But, it really all just comes down to whether or not you got the guts to say just exactly what you know in your heart of hearts you really should say.
13574	Dr. Kelso	Sooo, Ted! How is Professor Cox doing?
13575	Lawyer	Excellent, sir!

13589	J.D.	She just cut off a pair of scrubs and hemmed the bottom. What's the big deal?
13590	Janitor	What's the big deal? Well, the Good Lord didn't bless my wife with all ten fingers. She's only got pointer...and...thumb-pinkie.
13591	J.D.	Look, I'm sorry, okay? For...so many things. But, I'm a doctor I can't really wear shorts to work.
13592	Janitor	Can't wear shorts to work?

13599	J.D.	Oh, without a doubt.... But not about me. No, I...I kinda made all that stuff up. It just seems like you and I only really click when something crazy is going on.
13600	Jamie	Mm.
13601	J.D.	I dunno, I guess I realized I don't really want to be in a relationship like that.
13602	Jamie	Is that an ultimatum?
13603	J.D.	No, Jamie, no! It's not an ultimatum, it's just something to think about.

13615	Carla	I know it's silly and I know it's only for one day but ever since I was a little girl, all I wanted to do was have a big, beautiful wedding.
13616	Turk	Baby, you don't want to do this.
13617	Carla	What?
13618	Turk	Look, since your mother passed, you probably been feeling lonely, and like you don't have any family. But I'm your family now whether we do it like this, or we wait and do it like you've always wanted to. Don't you think?
13619	Dr. Cox	Holy cow, talk about your gigantic time-wasters.
13620	Nurse Roberts	Tell me about it.
13621	Elliot	Oh, come on lighten up, slut!
13622	Nurse Roberts	What, now?
13623	J.D.'s Narration	I think relationships can be defined by big moments that don't happen. ...Or by the little ones that do.
13624	Dr. Kelso's Office	Ted takes a moment alone in there to sit back in Dr. Kelso's chair, with his feet up on the desk, enjoying his Fresca.
13625	Lawyer	Ahhh. That's the stuff!
13626	J.D.'s Narration	But once you get past the drama, it's actually pretty simple.
13627	Jamie's Apartment	J.D. and Jamie are enjoying a simple, relaxing, romantic night. They kiss.
13628	J.D.'s Narration	All we have to do is whatever it takes to make her happy.
13629	Bridal Boutique	Carla beams as she tries on her dream dress. Turk checks the tag.
13630	Turk	Four thousand six hundred and six Yeah! Yeah.... Yeah....
13631	Carla	Yeah!
13632	Turk	Yeah....
13633	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13634	Dr. Kelso	Nurse Espinosa, do you by any chance know what time your 9:30 shift starts?
13635	Carla	9:30?
13636	Dr. Kelso	See, that's what I would have said. But then I had Ted stand out in the parking lot and monitor your arrival times this week! Ted?
13637	Lawyer	9:34, 9:39, 9:41, 9:33, and 9:50.
13638	Carla	How is that law degree working out for you, Ted?
13639	Lawyer	I was going to be a senator.
13640	Dr. Kelso	I haven't perused the latest nursing contract, but I'm guessing it doesn't say "Show up when you damn well please!"
13641	Dr. Cox	Oh, hey, Bob, here's an idea: What say you stop showing up altogether? We'll just replace you with a giant time-clock. Oh, and if we ever get to missing you, we'll just have a tiny little Bob Kelso cuckoo bird pop out every couple of minutes and say "I've never satisfied a woman. I've never satisfied a woman. I've never satisfied a woman."
13642	Dr. Kelso	Come on, Ted!
13643	J.D.'s Narration	Even though Dr. Cox still didn't know he was the father of Jordan's baby, they were getting along better than ever.
13644	Jordan	Love you.
13645	Dr. Cox	I love you.
13646	J.D.'s Narration	As for us, it's the end of our second year, and somehow each day had begun to feel the same.
13647	J.D.'s Narration	You see, after a while, your residency boils down to just a few things...
13648	J.D.'s Narration	Paperwork...
13649	J.D.'s Narration	The three prescriptions every patient gets...
13650	Elliot	Give Miss Allan Acetaminophen for her headache, Restoril so she'll sleep, and Colace so she'll poop.
13651	J.D.'s Narration	Paperwork...
13652	J.D.'s Narration	Mind-numbing monotony...
13653	J.D.'s Narration	And, of course, paperwork.
13654	J.D.'s Narration	As for the patients...
13655	J.D.	Uh, look, Mr. Graff, because it's diabetes-related, the pain in your foot isn't responding to pain-killers. But, I'd like to try an anti-seizure medication before we even consider amputation.
13656	Mr. Graff	Oh, good. 'Cause I have an audition for "Stomp!" tomorrow. Look, just cut the damn thing off, will ya?
13657	J.D.'s Narration	I guess that's why I'm so psyched our college buddy, Spence, is coming to town.
13658	Spence	Jill Anderson.
13659	Turk	Yes.
13660	Spence	Yes.
13661	J.D.	No.
13662	Turk	Monica Meyer.
13663	Spence	Yeah.
13664	Turk	Yes.
13665	J.D.	You know, guys, I don't think it's really appropriate for us to be rehashing our college sexual conquests with Carla in the other room
13666	Turk	Leslie Stevens!
13667	J.D.	YES! On a pile of coats with hundreds of people around! What a whore!
13668	Carla	Who else! Who else did you bang??
13669	J.D.	Carla...college wasn't all sex and coats. Spence, here, got me through a lot of hard times.
13670	***Flashback	Dorm Room
13671	Spence	Why don't you just mousse the crap out of it straight up!
13672	J.D.	Yes!
13673	J.D.	My life changed that day.
13674	Spence	Man, that was a long time ago! I mean, now you two are engaged, and I'm in town 'cause our frat brothers Shmitty and Dan are getting married....
13675	Carla	A double wedding?
13676	Spence	Mmm...
13677	J.D.	No.
13678	Turk	Mm-mm.
13679	Carla	Ohhhhhh.... Good for the boys!
13680	Spence	The point is, we've really grown up.
13681	Turk	Aw.
13682	J.D.	That's good good sauce.
13683	Spence	Check it out free pitcher.
13684	J.D.	What I've got you on is D5 half normal saline with 20 KCL at a hundred CCs an hour.
13685	Turk	This is the Cadillac of all hangover cures.
13686	Spence	It feels warm in my tummy!
13687	Dr. Cox	Good morning, angels. What'd you have, one too many daiquiris last night?
13688	J.D.	Spence, this is Dr. Cox and
13689	Jordan	Don't bother. Don't care.
13690	Spence	Oh, oh! Right, yeah! He's the scary man you told me about last night. Hey, congratulations!
13691	Dr. Cox	For what, jack-ass?
13692	Spence	You just had a baby!
13693	J.D.	No, no, no, _she_ just had a baby.
13694	Spence	Yeah, but you said it was his. ...And you said something else....
13695	Turk	That he didn't know it yet.
13696	Spence	That's exactly right!
13697	J.D.'s Thoughts	Holy crap! Run away! Run away! Run away! Run away! Run aw
13698	J.D.	Oook!
13699	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13700	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, he hasn't said a word in over ten minutes.... Eh, the hell with it. I'm going in.
13701	J.D.	Dr. Cox
13702	Dr. Cox	Newbie, if the next two words out of your mouth aren't "see ya", then the third word will be "Oh, my God, my crotch, you've punched me in the crotch."
13703	J.D.	See ya.
13704	Spence	How about that guy?
13705	J.D.	Yeah.
13706	Spence	That guy?
13707	J.D.	Yeah. You know what? Maybe it would just be easier if I told you whose butt I _haven't_ had my fingers in?
13708	Spence	Now that's one of the perks you never hear about. So, you guys pretty much landed your dream jobs, huh?
13709	J.D.'s Thoughts	Dream job....
13710	***Fantasy Sequence	Office...Made Entirely of Chocolate
13711	Turk	Hey, man? How am I supposed to finish this memo?
13712	J.D.	Mm-mm-mm.
13713	Spence	Do you at least have any interesting patients?
13714	Turk	Well, there's Mr. Weinberg, who has dementia but still enjoys his wronking.
13715	Spence	What's wronking?
13716	Old Man	WRONK!
13717	Spence	Interesting.
13718	Turk	Hey, Sweetness.
13719	J.D.	Wronk.
13720	Spence	Hey, so, uh, when do people get to yell, like, "stat!" and stuff?
13721	Carla	Kinda never. Bambi. Rounds!
13722	J.D.	Oh, dammit!
13723	Spence	RUN, JOHNNY! RUN!
13724	Spence	Just trying to add a little drama.
13725	Carla	I felt it!
13726	J.D.'s Thoughts	This is not a good day to be late.
13727	J.D.'s Narration	Every year at this time, Kelso picks a resident to ride mercilessly until they crumble. The key is to jump on any easy question and impress him early.
13728	Dr. Kelso	All right. Shall we get started?
13729	J.D.	Yes!
13730	Dr. Kelso	Excuse me?
13731	J.D.	"Should we get started?" Answer: yes.
13732	Dr. Kelso	Wow. Dr. Reid, do an ABG on bed four _without_ waking him.
13733	Elliot	Mm-hmm.
13734	Dr. Kelso	Dr., uh, uh...Young Asian Fellow, bed seven needs a central line.
13735	Dr. Kelso	And Dr. Murphy and Dr. Eager Beaver, step forward.
13736	J.D.'s Thoughts	This is it. Last man standing.
13737	Dr. Kelso	What are the four differential diagnoses of the persistent ST elevation on any EKG? Dorian!
13738	J.D.	E-eschemia.
13739	Dr. Kelso	Murphy!
13740	Doug	Aneurysm.
13741	Dr. Kelso	Dorian!
13742	J.D.	Pericarditis.
13743	Dr. Kelso	Murphy!
13744	Doug	Pass!
13745	J.D.'s Thoughts	Aw, Doug.... At least you're going to a more chocolatey place.
13746	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Murphy....
13747	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Reid! A moment please.
13748	Carla	No you didn't!
13749	Elliot	I did! And now every time I turn around, Dr. Kelso's riding me.
13750	Todd	I've got next! Wassaaaaap!
13751	Todd	No one? Self five! For the big dog.
13752	Carla	Look, Elliot, I've seen this before. Kelso starts to worry he's not scary anymore, so he picks somebody to be his bitch. Who he picks is totally random. You know, unless you...throw a needle in his face.
13753	Jordan	Okay, I didn't tell you that the kid was yours and you're upset I get it! But you seem to be making a really big deal out of this. Is there something else that's bothering you?
13754	Dr. Cox	It's mostly just the kid thing.
13755	Jordan	I told you, I didn't want you to feel pressured to be with me. I didn't want you to feel manipulated.
13756	Dr. Cox	Jordan, I am sooooosososososo sorry, but no matter what you say, you don't have a leg to stand on.
13757	Carla	Yeah, I don't know about that, Perry. Sounds to me like she's trying to protect your relationship.
13758	Elliot	Yeah, I mean, some people's mothers say the only way to get a guy to marry you is by using pregnancy as a trap.
13759	Dr. Cox	What!?
13760	Elliot	Uh, stupid mothers who got even meaner when they stopped drinking....
13761	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13762	J.D.	Mornin'.
13763	Janitor	I make more than you do!
13764	J.D.	Uh, what?
13765	Janitor	I saw your paycheck, and I've been dying to tell you I make more than you do. Quite a bit more.
13766	J.D.	You couldn't have seen my paycheck.
13767	Janitor	Right. 'Cause there's no way I could access the personnel files. Just impossible!
13768	Janitor	By the way, uh: 987-65-4320
13769	J.D.	That's my social security number!
13770	Janitor	No...that's your PIN number.
13771	J.D.	No, my PIN number is 3674.
13772	Janitor	Bingo!
13773	J.D.	Do you have any idea what it feels like to have a janitor make more money than you?
13774	Spence	Johnny.... Investment Banker. So, no.
13775	Spence	Why, Christopher?
13776	Turk	Hey, so I saved up, like, five hundred bucks? Where would you put that if you were me?
13777	Spence	I dunno, a wallet? A money-clip? Hey! You could get Shmitty and Dan a wedding gift. Dan wants a ferret.
13778	J.D.	Oh! Ferrets are nice!
13779	Turk	They're mean.
13780	Spence	Guys! Whatta you say we go do something special tonight, huh? My treat!
13781	J.D.	We gotta kinda lay low tonight, 'cause we're on back-up call.
13782	Turk	Back-up call.
13783	Spence	See, now, this is the proper way to lay low. I mean, honestly, does it get any better?
13784	Turk	No it does not!
13785	***Fantasy Sequence	J.D. reaches over to Turk, snaps off an ear and takes a bite pure chocolate.
13786	Turk	Why you keep looking at me like that?
13787	Spence	People!
13788	Lady	Ed! Did you turn on the jets in the hot tub?
13789	Ed	No!
13790	J.D.	It's too hot on my eyes!
13791	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13792	Dr. Kelso	Those sutures look awful! Don't you think, Ted?
13793	Lawyer	I don't know, sir. Yes, no...I'm barely here.
13794	Elliot	I know what you're doing, sir the whole "keep us scared" thing. Grrrrrr! Heh! I am okay with it.
13795	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Reid, even if you hadn't just missed blinding me earlier, I still would've picked you to crap on. See, you're easily startled, you're constantly overwhelmed, and while you work as hard as anyone here, you're still struggling to break into the middle of the pack! I chose you because I am hoping that you will ask yourself _really_ ask yourself if there isn't some other profession you might be better suited for. In the meantime, be a doll a re-suture that wound.
13796	Lawyer	Wanna get a beer later?
13797	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13798	Dr. Cox	I just can't believe you didn't tell me.
13799	Jordan	...And, while we're coming completely clean, Perry, I'm not actually the girl they're singing about in "My Sharona" her name's Sharona.
13800	Dr. Cox	You're making jokes?
13801	Jordan	I just want this to be okay.
13802	Dr. Cox	Jordan, don't get me wrong, I wanna be the with kid I'm...I'm damn sure gonna be with the kid but as far as you and I go...I just don't see us working out.
13803	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13804	Spence	Nothing like drinking cold beers in a jacuzzi, am I right, Ed?
13805	Ed	Hell, some days I just sit out here for hours on end, downing cold one after cold one.
13806	J.D.	What do you do when you have to pee?
13807	Ed	So you boys are doctors, huh?
13808	Turk	Okay, yeah whoa, Frannie! That was my ass!
13809	Spence	You guys have to go to work?
13810	J.D.	Nah, it's just a stupid intern.
13811	Turk	Besides, the only way we'd have to go in is if there was some kind of catastrophe.
13812	Newscaster	In breaking news, there's been a multiple-car pile-up on the throughway.
13813	J.D.	Plus, the two guys who are on call would have to be, like, simultaneously incapacitated.
13814	Newscaster	Twelve vehicles were involved in the accident. Eyewitness reports...
13815	Doug	This is my chance to shine!
13816	Todd	Wassup, chica!
13817	Todd	Ohh, ohhh! God!
13818	J.D.'s Narration	Part of being a doctor is learning to deal with the unexpected. Whether it's someone who won't take "no" for an answer...
13819	Hospital Hall	Jordan follows Dr. Cox through.
13820	Jordan	Yeah, I've decided not to accept the whole being dumped thing. I'm just gonna hang around until you forgive me.
13821	J.D.'s Narration	...Or being shaken to your very core.
13822	I.C.U.	Elliot stands frozen by Dr. Kelso's words.
13823	Old man	WRONK!
13824	Ted	Gaaagh!
13825	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, sometimes it's just having to work in wet grundies.
13826	Dr. Cox	Hey, Betty. Hey, Wilma. Oh, what the hell, you're only forty minutes late. Do I...do I smell beer?
13827	J.D.	Uh, we...we, uh, we had a few.
13828	Dr. Cox	Newsflash: you can't drink and then come to work you're not airline pilots!
13829	J.D.	Look, Dr. Cox....
13830	Dr. Cox	No, you look! If someone had asked me just this morning, Is there any way that I could have less respect for you two geniuses? I would have said, "No! No, that's not possible!" But, lo and behold, you went and pulled it off. Congratulations. The only problem is I'm I'm fresh out of blue ribbons, so instead, you're gonna have to settle for a lifetime supply of my foot up your ass! Now go home. You're not fit to work tonight.
13831	Jordan	Great speech.
13832	Jordan	You guys are in trouble!
13833	Jordan	...Wait up! I got my heels on!
13834	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13835	J.D.'s Narration	After what happened, I was in no mood to be messed with.
13836	Janitor	Hey, Foodstamps!
13837	Janitor	Little anonymous donation from a guy who makes a little more scratch than you.
13838	J.D.	You know what? At least what I do matters! Okay? You're cleaning the same spot you were this morning, and the smart money says you'll be cleaning it again tomorrow. So why don't I just come by then, and you can tell me how what you do day after day makes even the slightest bit of difference in this world.
13839	Janitor	Too mean!
13840	J.D.'s Narration	I don't care if I hurt his feelings, 'cause I got absolutely crushed tonight. Luckily, Turk and I both knew who was responsible for all this.
13841	Spence	Crockett. Tubbs.
13842	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13843	Jordan	When do we eat?
13844	Dr. Cox	Look, Jordan, could you just give me ten seconds to myself here?
13845	Jordan	Mmmm, no.
13846	Dr. Cox	You know, you are being very immature! And, oh, my God! Is that guy on fire!?
13847	Elliot	Dr. Cox! I'm so glad you're here!
13848	Dr. Cox	Oh, from one hell to another.
13849	Elliot	Oh. Dr. Kelso's been torturing me lately, and I really thought that I could handle it. I mean, after all, I've come a long way...you know. For instance, I used to be afraid of you, and now I can talk to you about anything like how your hair has been looking particularly springy lately. And not like the season, but more like the inside of a mattress. You know what I mean?
13850	Dr. Cox	I don't have any clue what you mean!
13851	Elliot	Dr. Kelso's starting to get to me, and I don't think I can take it anymore.
13852	Dr. Cox	Sorry, kid, but I'm kinda dealing with my own stuff right now.
13853	Elliot	Thanks a lot. Really.
13854	Jordan	Howdy, Mop-top!
13855	Dr. Cox	Oh, God!
13856	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13857	Turk	Man, why'd you even show up this weekend?
13858	Spence	What are you talking about? I'm the one who introduced Shmitty and Dan! ...Okay.... I didn't really introduce them, but I'm the one who accidentally saw them under the foosball table. Aw, Shmitty....
13859	J.D.	Typical Spence. You just blow into town and get us in a bunch of trouble.
13860	Spence	What, I _made_ you guys go out tonight? Hey, I have a venture capital presentation Thursday. Ask me if I want to go out drinking Wednesday night.
13861	J.D. and Turk	You wanna go
13862	Spence	Sorry, sorry, I can't. I have a presentation. You see, the truth is you guys have been complaining about work since the second I got here, just dying for an excuse to blow it off. So maybe you should stop being all mad at me when really you're just pissed 'cause you hate your jobs.
13863	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13864	Elliot	Every time I turn around, Kelso's there! Ted, he's trying to break my spirit! I mean, do you have any idea what that feels like?
13865	Elliot	Oh, I'm sorry 'course you do.
13866	Lawyer	Dr. Reid, I'm afraid that nothing you've described constitutes harassment.
13867	Dr. Kelso	Swing and a miss, eh, Dr. Reid! Well, the next time you decide to make a stink over nothing, maybe you should see a lawyer who didn't need five tries to pass the bar exam!
13868	Lawyer	I have stress-induced dyslexia, and you know that, Dr...Oslek.
13869	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13870	Dr. Cox	Why are you doing this?
13871	Jordan	I'll tell you why I'm doing this, Perry. Because we've been dancing the same annoying dance for years now! One of us gets angry and walks away, and the other person's too stubborn to go after them. Before you know it, you're sleeping with some toothpick-size pharmaceutical rep, and I'm trying to convince my mom that the thing in my suitcase is a giant electric melon-baller! Well guess what? Things are different now we have a kid together. I'm not going home until you promise that you're coming home with me.
13872	Dr. Cox	You go home. I'll meet you there later.
13873	Jordan	Bring dinner.
13874	Jordan	You're a father, can you believe it?
13875	Dr. Cox	No.
13876	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13877	J.D.'s Narration	I didn't get a lot of sleep thinking about what Spence had said.
13878	J.D.	Look, I'm sorry I was such a jerk yesterday, okay? I mean, come on, look at this floor! You could practically eat off of it!
13879	Janitor	Would you?
13880	J.D.	Would I what?
13881	Janitor	Would you eat off the floor?
13882	J.D.'s Narration	As I bent down to eat that peppered floor turkey, unaware that the cleanser the Janitor uses is an extremely potent diuretic, I realized something.
13883	J.D.	Aaaaah.
13884	J.D.'s Narration	...The reason we're doctors is because we have an innate desire to help people.
13885	Janitor	That was disgusting.
13886	J.D.'s Narration	And you have to have that desire, because at the end of your second year it's impossible to see the light at the end of the tunnel.
13887	***Fantasy Shot	J.D. makes his way through the hall, amid a tornado of paperwork.
13888	J.D.'s Narration	So it becomes about perseverance...
13889	J.D.'s Narration	...and fortitude...
13890	J.D.'s Narration	...and sacrifice.
13891	Hospital Entrance	J.D. and Turk are seeing Spence off.
13892	Spence	Well, I'm sorry you guys can't make the wedding.
13893	J.D.	Yeah, well, give the guys a big kiss for us.
13894	Turk	Don't forget to tell 'em that the ferret only eats fresh vegetables.
13895	Spence	I'm gonna miss you guys.... I'll see you later.
13896	J.D.	Later.
13897	Turk	Later, dude.
13898	J.D.'s Narration	Really, all you can hope for is just an occasional thank-you.
13899	J.D.	I'm so glad the medication worked on your foot.
13900	Mr. Graff	So I'm supposed to be happy because someone finally did something right?
13901	J.D.'s Thoughts	You're welcome.
13902	Dr. Cox	Nice call on the anti-seizure medication, there, Newbie. You know I'm actually starting to think you may not be the worst resident that ever lived.
13903	J.D.	Ohhh! How cool was that!
13904	Mr. Graff	Shut up.
13905	J.D.	You shut up. You're an angry man!
13906	J.D.	I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the whole "it's your baby" thing.
13907	J.D.	We'll probably talk about that later.
13908	Dr. Cox	You know I'm I wasn't even mad at Jordan.
13909	J.D.	No?
13910	Dr. Cox	No, I was scared. In fact, I was freaking out all day, because I'm quite confident that I'm gonna be an absolutely horrible father.
13911	J.D.	You? Come on! You're gonna be a very scary fath I mean a great...you're gonna be a great father. Like last night, when you totally kicked our asses 'cause we deserved it? And do you remember that time you told me I wasn't the worst resident that ever lived?
13912	Dr. Cox	You mean like eight seconds ago?
13913	J.D.	You have no idea how much that meant to me.
13914	Dr. Cox	I said I _think_ you may not be the worst resident ever, but I can't be sure of stuff like that. Come on, I haven't done the appropriate leg work!
13915	J.D.	But, Dr. Cox, you're always there when we need you! I think you have this fathering thing down!
13916	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13917	Dr. Kelso	Why am I not leaving, Dr. Reid? Because I don't want to miss you breaking down and weeping in front of everyone! Oh, here it comes! Great big tears! Great big crocodile tears!
13918	J.D.	See, if she was your daughter, you'd totally know how to handle it.
13919	Dr. Cox	My God, you're right.
13920	Dr. Cox	You're doing fine, there, Barbie.
13921	Elliot	Thank you?
13922	Dr. Cox	Everybody have a good one! I'm going home to see my son.
13923	Dr. Cox	Whoa, excuse me, there, Bobbo.
13924	The camera circles around to the reactions of those gathered. They all stare at Kelso	Turk and Carla, both with their jaws dropped. Elliot, still quite stunned. Ted, giggling hysterically. Nurse Roberts, on the phone...
13925	Nurse Roberts	Girl! He hit him right in the nose! Uh-huh! Yeah!
13926	J.D.'s Thoughts	That may come up tomorrow....
13927	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13928	J.D.'s Narration	Before I go into that building and start my day, I always like to take a quiet moment to prepare myself.
13929	J.D.	Bump-ba-bump-ba-bump, ba-bump, bump; bump, bump, bump. "Well I guess it would be nice / if I could touch your body" not you, sir "I know not everybody / has got a body like you / Owwwwwwwww / But I...."
13930	Turk	Dude, what's the rule about white boys dancing in public?
13931	J.D.	Not allowed unless you're gay.
13932	J.D. & Turk	Morning, Steven.
13933	J.D.	Fine. Then I'll just put on something that rocks!
13934	J.D.'s Narration	As a third-year resident, you know everyone so well you can practically speak for them. For instance....
13935	J.D.'s Thoughts	Remember: No more dancing.
13936	J.D.'s Thoughts	Pow!
13937	J.D.'s Thoughts	Good morning, Bambi. Sign this, please?
13938	J.D.'s Thoughts	Who you eyeballing, tough guy?
13939	J.D.'s Narration	And of course....
13940	J.D.'s Thoughts	Well, Zsa Zsa. Now you've put me in quite the pickle. You see, with those earphones on, you can't hear me; but! the odds are highly against you cracking open that yapper and annoying me today. So, what to do? What to do? What to do? Ahh, hell
13941	Dr. Cox	Stop addressing me as "Dr. Cox" in front of your patients. When they find out my actual name, they tend to page me with questions when they realize just exactly how inept you really are. Oh, and as an added safety measure, from now on, I'll only be responding to "Doc," "Doctor," "Ceasar," or "The Big Cheese;" and noooo, I'm _not_ joking. Not _now_ not ever.
13942	J.D.'s Narration	See, things never really change around here.
13943	J.D.'s Narration	...Surgical and Medical still play each other in basketball.
13944	Surgeon	I'm gonna toast you so bad, your momma ain't even gonna recognize you!
13945	J.D.	Yeah? Well I heard that your sister started drinking again!
13946	J.D.'s Narration	I'm still not great at smack-talk.
13947	J.D.	So, it's not supposed to be true?
13948	Turk	No. Ohhh, let it pour, big guy.
13949	J.D.'s Narration	And Elliot was still searching for something to turn things around for her.
13950	Elliot	Oh, my God! Isn't she beautiful! I mean, this car has totally maxed out my credit, but my self-esteem's been so low lately that I think it's worth it. Don't you?
13951	Delivery Guy	I just deliver the cars. She's all yours.
13952	Elliot	Frick!
13953	J.D.'s Narration	But really, the only difference is that by the third year, nothing catches you by surprise.
13954	Carla	Mrs. Farr is still having acute abdominal pain.
13955	Mrs. Farr	So, what's wrong with me, doctor?
13956	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, good Lord, I have no idea. Okay, don't panic, just do what all doctors do in this situation and fake a page.
13957	J.D.	Uh-oh. Got a Code 3 down the hall.
13958	Mrs. Farr	What's that?
13959	J.D.	Uhhh, Code 3? Not as bad as a Code 4, but a hell of a lot worse than a Code 2.
13960	Carla	_That's_ a Code 2.
13961	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13962	J.D.	Ahh, I cannot figure out what's wrong with Mrs. Farr. I gotta go ask Cox.
13963	Turk	Why won't you ask me?
13964	J.D.	You're a surgeon you just cut people up, you don't actually know anything.
13965	Turk	Oh, yeah.
13966	J.D.	Dr. Cox! Dr. Cox.
13967	J.D.	Big Cheese.
13968	Dr. Cox	Yes?
13969	J.D.'s Narration	If you're wondering why Dr. Kelso's nose is squeaking...
13970	FLASHBACK	ADMISSIONS
13971	J.D.'s Narration	...about a week ago, he was torturing Elliot...
13972	J.D.'s Narration	...and Dr. Cox, well....
13973	J.D.'s Narration	Needless to say, there were consequences.
13974	Dr. Kelso	Perry, great news: I managed to swing it so that you get to go over to the state pen. today and do the annual inmates' physicals!
13975	Dr. Cox	Well, hell's bells, Bobbo, if you want to fire me, just do it!
13976	Dr. Kelso	I would, but even though this room was quite crowded when you sucker-punched me, apparently nobody saw it happen.
13977	Lawyer	Uh, so what happened, sir?
13978	J.D.	So, Dr. Cox, can you, uh, look at her chart?
13979	Dr. Cox	Newbie, did you not see what just happened? Kelso is so far up my ass that I can taste Brylcreem in the back of my throat. And you, you're...you're third-year now. Wake up, this whole Dr. Cox Riding in to The Rescue part of the show is _over_.
13980	Dr. Cox	Oh, you're on your own.
13981	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13982	J.D.'s Narration	Elliot's unlucky streak continued with the head of the radiology department.
13983	Elliot	Dr. Moyer. Uh, you told me my patient had colitis, and it turns out it was just traveler's diarrhea?
13984	Dr. Moyer	So? Sounds like good news.
13985	Elliot	Yeah.... He took it as bad news, maybe 'cause of the unnecessary colonoscope I shoved three feet up his pooper?
13986	Dr. Moyer	What do you want me to do?
13987	Elliot	Uh, apologize to my patient and tell him it was your mistake, no big deal?
13988	Dr. Moyer	Think I'm gonna pass on that one. See, I got you pegged as one of those spineless types that's not gonna cause me any trouble no matter what I do. So, thanks for stopping by, and don't forget your car door.
13989	Elliot	I just didn't want it to get stolen, okay?
13990	Dr. Moyer	That was me not caring.
13991	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
13992	Janitor	What?
13993	J.D.'s Narration	Now that we can always hear Dr. Kelso coming, some people have modified their work habits.

13995	Lawyer	So, you're engaged to that surgeon guy?
13996	Carla	Mm-hmm.
13997	Lawyer	Is it serious?
13998	Carla	No, Ted. We swing.
13999	Janitor	Squeaky's a-comin'!
14000	Dr. Cox	Oh, hey, Bob-cat! Listen, I was hoping that maybe you could get someone to cover for me out at the prison tonight. I know that the very idea of you doing a favor for me makes those ass cheeks clench up so tight that you could shove a lump of coal up there and probably crap out a diamond! Right?
14001	Dr. Cox	Ohh.... Come on, Bob, I can't even remember the last time I saw my son, and you you you're a father, for God's sake; you understand, don't you?
14002	Dr. Kelso	My son was recently kicked out of his Hari Krishna sect for being too much of a hippie, and is currently residing in the Portland subway system. The point, Perry, is that the only thing I care less about than my son...is your son. Have fun at the Big House.

14004	Carla	Hey. You guys know that unbelievably handsome new anesthesiologist?
14005	J.D.	Yes.
14006	Turk	No.
14007	J.D.	No.
14008	Carla	Well, he didn't know I was engaged, so he asked me out to a movie tonight.
14009	Turk	Well, if he's paying, give a brother some Snow Caps!
14010	Carla	Turk, why don't you ever get jealous?
14011	Turk	Woman, look at me! How can someone with all of this here be jealous of any of that out there!
14012	Elliot	You know what I realized when I was dragging my car door around? I cannot remember the last good thing that happened to me at this place. I mean, what is it about me that makes everybody walk all over me?
14013	Carla	No self-confidence.
14014	Turk	You could be a baby sometimes.
14015	J.D.	Your voice gets really high when you're upset.
14016	Elliot	Rhetorical question, okay?
14017	Carla	Peach Fizzle-Vizzle?
14018	J.D.	I'll have a Razz-ma-Tazz?
14019	Turk	Orange Goo Goo.
14020	Elliot	Got it.
14021	J.D.	Mrs. Farr. You know what? The only way I'm gonna figure out what's wrong with this woman is start running tests for everything.
14022	Carla	Good luck, Bambi. Look at the time.
14023	J.D.'s Narration	In a hospital, you can never try to get anything done Friday after 5 P.M. Because anyone who can actually help you is out of here like a gunshot.
14024	FANTASY	There's a gunshot. Suddenly, the whole cafeteria is deserted except for J.D. and a spinning plate.
14025	J.D.	Hello? Anyone?
14026	J.D.	Have a good weekend, Steven.
14027	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14028	Elliot	Sean?
14029	Sean	Hey, Elliot! How you how you doing?
14030	Elliot	You look great! Except, the buzz-cut has kind of tapped into this recurring dream I have where my dad makes me marry this army colonel named Johnny Case who, as it turns out, already has a wife in the Philippines. Anyways, she and I become friends, but then she smothers him with her thighs and then frames me for it.
14031	Sean	Well, yeah, I'm I'm doing about the same, too.
14032	Sean	I thought you hated this place 'cause of that time you you got sick here?
14033	Elliot	You remember that?
14034	Sean	Y-you got sick on my face....
14035	Elliot	Oh, no, that wasn't the smoothies you just said you thought you were falling in love with me, and sometimes when I get really uncomfortable I hurl.
14036	Sean	I know, I get I get a little, uh...gassy.
14037	Elliot	Look, Sean, this is gonna sound weird, but this is fate! I mean, things have just been so bleak for me lately, and I've been waiting for something someone to come along, you know? And...here you are. The one that got away! That means something, right?
14038	Sean	Yeah, I think it, uh....
14039	Girl	Hello!
14040	Sean	Hey. Hi. Oh!
14041	Sean	No, no, no, no! It's okay. It's ok it's....
14042	Girl	That girl is extra-strength crazy.
14043	Sean	I don't know; I mean, she's a doctor, she's gotta have it a little bit together, right?

14048	J.D.'s Narration	I was trying to keep things positive with Mrs. Farr.

14050	Mrs. Farr	Why, am I going home tonight?
14051	J.D.	No, the cook died.
14052	J.D.'s Thoughts	What the hell am I gonna do?
14053	Turk	Hey.
14054	J.D. turns to the NURSES' STATION, where Turk and Carla are hanging out. The clock on the wall behind them reads 7	0.
14055	Turk	She wanted to come back and help. And I wasn't gonna let my baby be here all alone with all sorts of guys eyeballing her privates and whatnot.
14056	Carla	If you can't muster up some sincere jealousy, don't even bother.
14057	Elliot	I got everyone's smoothies. They were out of Orange Goo Goo.
14058	Carla	How can we help, Bambi?
14059	J.D.	Okay, if we're ever gonna figure out what's wrong with that lady, we need to get a whole bunch of tests done.
14060	J.D.'s Narration	There's nothing wrong with needing your friends to take care of someone.... It's better than missing out on your family because you're stuck making new friends....
14061	Dr. Cox	That's, uh, that's my son.
14062	Prisoner	He's adorable. Can I keep it?
14063	Dr. Cox	No, no you you certainly may not!
14064	Dr. Cox	Bad man.
14065	J.D.'s Narration	Still, even that's not the worst....
14066	J.D.	'Kay, I'll get the x-ray, you two go work on the echo-cardiogram, and then all three of us will meet back here and deal with the abdominal CAT-scan, okay?
14067	Carla	Got'cha.
14068	Turk	Mm-hmm.
14069	Elliot	Well, what can I do?
14070	J.D.	We got it, Elliot.
14071	J.D.'s Narration	Being such a mess that your friends don't even ask for your help? That's the bottom of the barrel.

14073	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes in life, all there is to do is ponder your own shortcomings by cannon-balling four straight 32-ounce, protein-enhanced smoothies.
14074	Elliot	Eugh.
14075	Nurse Roberts	You'll be okay, Marshmallow.
14076	Elliot	Laverne, do you call me "Marshmallow" because I'm soft and easily flattened?
14077	Nurse Roberts	Well, yeah.... But, if it makes you feel any better, it's also because you're _very_ white.

14085	Laddy	Uh-uh-uh! Don't want to know who they are! Don't want to know how they're doing! Just wanna go "click-click!" and get 'em out of here! Now, your lady's about forty people down on the list. And as always, uh, there are no cutsies.
14086	J.D.	Damn!
14087	Laddy	See, because of the way I laid on top of you, I can tell people this is an x-ray of Siamese twins! How cool is that!
14088	J.D.	It's so cool, Laddy, let's never talk to anyone about it, ever!
14089	Laddy	Oh.
14090	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14091	Turk	I don't understand how you think you can get this cardiologist to do an echo-cardiogram for us.
14092	Carla	I've worked in the Cath. Lab before I understand how these guys think. Plus I had a one-nighter with him a long time ago.
14093	Turk	Okay! Oh-ho-ho! You're telling me this guy in here got tasty treats?
14094	Carla	Turk! I worked here eight years before you showed up I had sexual needs.
14095	Turk	Okay, first of all, that's disgusting.
14096	Carla	Are you jealous?
14097	Turk	Nahhh....
14098	Carla	Ahhh, so you don't mind if I go in there alone.
14099	Turk	Thank you.
14100	Turk	AGH!
14101	Carla	So, Mitchell, I guess I was just hoping that you would help us out with this patient, Mrs. Farr.
14102	Mitchell	Carla, love to, really, but, uh, it's already six and it's my son's birthday tonight.
14103	Carla	How old is he?
14104	Mitchell	He's ten.
14105	Carla	And how long ago was that night that you told me you were single and you took me dancing...?
14106	Mitchell	Eight years. I'll see you in the patient's room.
14107	Carla	All taken care of.

14110	Jordan	Don't you love the outfit?

14112	Jordan	I may have painted his toenails for funsies.
14113	J.D.	Dr. Cox, I managed to get some tests done on Mrs. Farr....
14114	Dr. Cox	Look, Gwyneth, you're old enough now to hear this from me: Every time I go out of my way to help you children, I get nothing but trouble. Now this is the first five-minute window I've had in the last week to be with my son. And I'm just not gonna have you pirouetting around in here while my heart is breaking inside.
14115	J.D.	Sorry.
14116	Jordan	Your heart is breaking inside? That is so embarrassing for you!
14117	Dr. Cox	Thank you for that.

14119	Elliot	What are you doing in here!?
14120	Janitor	It's...the men's room.
14121	Elliot	I know! I mean, it's not like I thought those were some kind of new female urinals, and then...tried them, and found them...oddly comfortable....
14122	Janitor	I'm just gonna replace these, uh, urinal cakes , and then, uh, I'll go.
14123	Elliot	Why can't I just grow up? Why can't I be stronger?
14124	Janitor	No.... I'm a winner. But, I will tell you something that my grandmother told me when I was a kid; even though at the time I thought she was my mother. She said, "Time spent wishing is time wasted." Now, she died shortly after that, and my sister who actually _was_ my mother she never got over it. Neither did my brother-dad. But the point is this: If you want to be different, then be different!
14125	Elliot	Thank you.
14126	J.D.	Well, we're all under one roof here, we gotta watch out for each other, right? Come on!
14127	Elliot	'Kay.
14128	Janitor	There he is.
14129	J.D.	Whoooa! Agh!
14130	Janitor	Watch out.
14131	J.D.'s Thoughts	Ow.
14132	J.D.'s Narration	Unfortunately, that's when we ran into a brick wall.
14133	Dr. Moyer	I'm head of the radiology department. You call me in from home to do an abdominal CAT-scan that could wait until Monday morning? Well, guess what? It's not happening.
14134	J.D.	Look, Dr. Moyer
14135	Dr. Moyer	THESE ARE MY MACHINES!
14136	Carla	Sir
14137	Dr. Moyer	MY MACHINES!
14138	Turk	Whose machines?

14145	Dr. Kelso	Mmgh!
14146	Dr. Cox	Now, I'm real sorry I cold-cocked you, there, Bob I shouldn't have done that. Even if it did actually feel so damn good I changed my pants afterwards.
14147	Dr. Cox	But, still, I'm starting to think it would be smart if you and I were to bury the hatchet. What do you say, there, Bob?
14148	Dr. Cox	Come, on, handsome!
14149	Dr. Kelso	Listen up, ace: You will always be a royal pain in my ass, and I will always be waiting for the day when I get to jam that knife into your side once and for all; and you know it as well as I do!
14150	Dr. Kelso	Much better, thanks!
14151	Dr. Cox	You're welcome.
14152	Dr. Kelso	People don't change, Perry.
14153	Elliot's Thoughts	So you're just gonna roll over and give up like you always do? Or are you finally gonna get mad and do something about it?
14154	Dr. Moyer	MINE! MINE! MINE! MINE! MINE!!!
14155	Elliot	Dr. Moyer, you're gonna give Mrs. Farr the abdominal CAT-scan, and I'll tell you why: You remember that colon patient of mine that you screwed up on? Well I'm gonna tell him exactly whose fault that was, and then I'm gonna spend every waking second helping him figure out how to physically and financially bitch-slap you, even if the end result is that we both get our asses fired. Your move, chuckles.
14156	Dr. Moyer	Bring her down.
14157	Carla	Elliot!
14158	Turk	Hell, zhyeah!
14159	J.D.	Wow.
14160	J.D.'s Thoughts	It feels good to work as a team and gather all the pieces of the puzzle together so we can finally look Mrs. Farr in the face and tell her...we still don't know what the hell she has.
14161	J.D.	Dammit, why can't we figure out what's wrong with this lady?
14162	Dr. Cox	All right, you guys. What do you know so far?
14163	Carla	The echo ruled out an aortic dissection.
14164	Turk	The abdominal CT would have shown if it was biliary disease.
14165	Dr. Cox	Think. What's her background?
14166	Elliot	Persian Sephardic Jew.
14167	Dr. Cox	Aw, come on, you guys, gimme a break you know this.
14168	J.D.	Familial Mediterranean fever.
14169	Dr. Cox	Atta boy.
14170	J.D.'s Narration	I'm actually grateful most things don't change.
14171	Dr. Kelso	Hello, slackers!
14172	Lawyer	My paddle's stuck in me!
14173	J.D.'s Narration	Not only is the status quo good for work, it's also somewhat comforting.
14174	Dr. Cox	Now, I would've never figured it out unless you guys had done the leg work. You four deserve all the credit, really.
14175	Dr. Cox	Mrs. Farr, Dr. Cox has saved the day! Don't ya just love it? Come here!
14176	J.D.'s Narration	And if something does change, more often than not it just reminds you of feelings you've had all along.
14177	J.D.	You look beautiful.
14178	J.D.'s Narration	Like I said, once you hit the third year, there aren't a lot of surprises.

14182	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14183	J.D.'s Narration	Hospitals are filled with people who just came off 18-hour shifts. So when a patient dies, it's not uncommon to take them to the morgue yourself, then grab a little shut-eye in their bed.
14184	J.D.'s Narration	Unfortunately, sometimes you're beaten to the punch.
14185	J.D.	I'm up!
14186	J.D.	You can hardly notice it. It's actually kinda pretty!
14187	Nurse Roberts	Jack-ass.
14188	Turk	Look who's here.
14189	J.D.'s Narration	I'm never happy when a guy comes back into Elliot's life. But at least with Sean...it's entertaining.
14190	Elliot	Thanks for the latte. I should have warned you that the reason I love that place is that they're known for making the hottest coffee in town.
14191	Sean	Yeah, well, no sthweat. You know, lessthon learned.
14192	Carla	Is it me, or do those two seem less awkward around each other?
14193	Sean	Sthee ya, Elliot.
14194	Elliot	See ya!
14195	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14196	Carla	Okay, I have some news! We picked a date for the wedding.
14197	Carla	Tell 'em Turk.
14198	Carla	April 24th!
14199	Elliot	No, way! Mine is April 25th! 2006! Oh, the place I love in Connecticut books up early so what the hell, took a shot.
14200	J.D.	One, two, three...
14201	&	Crazy!
14202	Elliot	Oh, so you've never dreamt about your wedding day.
14203	Priest	Do you, John Dorian, take Marcia Brady to be your wife?
14204	Maureen McCormick	My name is Maureen McCormick.
14205	J.D.	Marcia, please!
14206	J.D.	No, I have not!
14207	Carla	Bambi, not everyone loves Journey as much as you.
14208	J.D.	I don't _love_ Journey.
14209	Turk	"She's just a small town girl..."
14210	J.D.	"...Livin' in a lonely world! She took a midnight train goin' aaaanywheeeere!" Fine, I love 'em. If you wanna book the band, they're called The Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin's and they rock! Book 'em now, thank me later.
14211	J.D.'s Narration	After that, the day got worse.
14212	Elliot	Thanks for giving me a ride down here to see Sean.
14213	Carla	I've never been to Sea World. What exactly does Sean do here, anyway?
14214	J.D.	Probably cleans up the seal poop!
14215	Elliot	There he is!
14216	J.D.	Lame!
14217	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14218	Carla	Who left this urine here?
14219	Dr. Cox	Someone's got a secret admirer!
14220	Carla	Dr. Kelso? Someone left this urine specimen sitting around. What's interesting is that the name tag's been ripped right off.
14221	Dr. Kelso	Sweetheart, I think you're confusing interesting with boring.
14222	J.D.	I can't believe you and Carla set a date.
14223	Turk	Yep, it's happening.
14224	Dr. Cox	Wedding talk! Ohh, how lovely!
14225	Listen, Hilton sisters	Mr. Quinn in 206 still has a severely shattered clavicle and he needs a surgical consult now. And, seeing as he's _your_ patient, and _you're_ a surgeon, gosh, I was hoping that if you two hens have an extra moment between choosing centerpieces and deciding just exactly how you're gonna attach that veil onto Baldy's head, well, it would just be super-de-duper if you could peek in in there and give him the old lookie-loo; wouldn't it?
14226	J.D.	Anyway, about this whole setting the date thing: I mean, I'm really psyched for you guys, it's just gonna be harder and harder for us to hang out, you know? I mean, you're gonna be married, man! You're gonna have, like, a house! You know? You're gonna be spending your weekends chasing around little Arturo and Rosaria!
14227	Turk	You mean Tamika and Fuquan?
14228	J.D.	You should...talk to Carla....
14229	Turk	Sounds like you're asking me out on a man-date.
14230	J.D.	Turk, why are you so afraid of loving me?
14231	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14232	Sean	Up!
14233	Elliot	Whoa! Do you actually talk to each other?
14234	Sean	Elliot, come on, he's just a dolphin.
14235	Sean	Because, Bruce, then she would think I was crazy, that's why!
14236	Elliot	You know, I am so glad that we're dating again.
14237	Sean	Elliot, we're not dating.
14238	Elliot	Why don't you want to be dating?
14239	Sean	Th well all right.... Here.... Man! Why is everything so much easier with dolphins?
14240	Elliot	Because you're not trying to date a dolphin.
14241	Sean	No. No. Well, not after that big talk they gave us. Elliot, last time we were together, I thought everything was going great, and then out of nowhere you dumped me for your job. I gotta be honest with you, I've never been so crushed in my entire life.
14242	Elliot	Really?
14243	Sean	Well, do you think that, uhh...you think the new Elliot, uh, would like to go to dinner tonight?
14244	Elliot	I don't know.... She's very busy....
14245	Sean	Mm-hmmm.
14246	Elliot	Oh!
14247	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14248	Carla	Well, I'm telling you, Laverne, by this afternoon we're gonna find out whose urine this is.
14249	Nurse Roberts	I got a better idea: Why don't _you_ do that. I'm gonna run across the street and get my tooth fixed so I can stop looking like Larry Holmes.
14250	Dr. Cox	Carla, you're forcing me to say something that I prayed I'd never have to say again to another woman: Please, please, please, put down the cup of urine.
14251	Cashier	6.50, please.
14252	Carla	6.50? For an egg-salad sandwich?
14253	Cashier	4.50 for the egg-salad, 2 bucks for the apple juice that you put in a urine container.
14254	Carla	Who would do that?!
14255	Todd	Just the burger for me.
14256	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14257	J.D.	Mr. Quinn, before I examine your clavicle, let me ask you something: Do you think it's out of line for me to want to take my best friend here to dinner?
14258	Mr. Quinn	Well, I, uhh....
14259	J.D.	I mean, this is like the end of an era! Okay? We've always been known as Turk-&-J.D. Like, when we were in college, people'd be like, "When are Turk-&-J.D. getting here?" Right? And then in med school, everyone was like, "When _are_ Turk-&-J.D. getting here?"
14260	Turk	We didn't have a car.
14261	J.D.	The point is, we were together so much, this one Indian girl only slept with him 'cause she thought his last name was "Anjadi".
14262	Turk	It was a very good day for me!
14263	J.D.	See! This is the kind of stuff I'm gonna miss! The...the reminiscing...the way your breath always smelled of curry....
14264	Turk	All right, fine, it's a man-date. Now, you and I, we're still on for surgery tomorrow, right?
14265	Mr. Quinn	Right. Listen, when you slice me up, make sure you don't mess up my tatt. my fiancé, Tracy, would kill me.
14266	J.D.	I had a tattoo once.
14267	Turk	Dude, you got your face painted at the hospital picnic.
14268	J.D.	I was a cougar! Arrgh-arrgh-aaarrgh! See ya later.
14269	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14270	Elliot	Dr. Cox, does this shade of red make me look like a clown?
14271	Dr. Cox	No, Barbie, no. It makes you look like a prostitute who caters exclusively _to_ clowns.
14272	Elliot	Oh, I'm sorry, that was my mistake. I keep forgetting that you're a horrible, horrible person.
14273	Dr. Cox	Oooh, backbone, Barbie.
14274	Dr. Cox	Heeee-xcuse me! You wouldn't happen to be signing out Mr. Hudson to the on-call resident, would you?
14275	Elliot	Eee-yeah, why?
14276	Dr. Cox	He's your patient, he needs a lumbar puncture, and you can't necessarily count on the on-call resident to do that, now, can you?
14277	Elliot	It's just that, Dr. Cox, I've got a date with this guy named Sean
14278	Dr. Cox	Would you do me a personal favor and excuse me just for one moment?
14279	Elliot	Yeah?
14280	Elliot	Dr. Cox, I cannot miss this dinner!
14281	Dr. Cox	Oh! Barbie, I I actually see your point. You should, in fact, go on your little date, because I have some busy work that's gonna take me over into the vicinity of Mr. Hudson's room, so I'll just pop my head in there and tell him that he's going to die. But, if you have a moment between dinner and giving it away for free, if you could pick up the phone and call Mr. Hudson's wife and kids and tell them about, you know, the dying...?
14282	Dr. Cox	Oh, I know, sugar. This would be just the most terrific place to work on the planet if it weren't for all these sick people. Wouldn't it.
14283	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14284	Carla	I'm sorry! I just thought that, as a urine lab technician, you'd be at least half as interested in urine as I am!
14285	Janitor	Hey, you know, I uh, it's not any of my business, but I think I know whose wizz that is.
14286	Carla	I love you!
14287	Carla	Okay, go.
14288	Janitor	Uh, his name is Mr. Freely.
14289	Carla	First name?
14290	J.D.	I.P.
14291	Carla	"I.P. Freely"?
14292	Janitor	Funny in third grade, funny now.
14293	Carla	Listen, Stretch, if you know who this belongs to, I'd 'fess up right now. Otherwise, I'm gonna grab you by the back of that two-dollar haircut and force-feed you the sample so _you_ can carry it around all day. That way, if I ever want it back, all I have to do is point you at a beaker and squeeze really hard! Now, you got any more funny jokes you gotta tell me?
14294	Janitor	No, ma'am.
14295	J.D.'s Narration	In a hospital, every day is made up of little battles.
14296	Carla	Can I have everyone's attention please? I officially don't care anymore who peed in this jar!
14297	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes you fight them not because you want to, but because you have to....
14298	Carla	Shut up.
14299	J.D.'s Narration	Other times you fight for what you want...
14300	Elliot	Sean, I can't make it to dinner.
14301	J.D.'s Narration	...but what you want isn't willing to wait.
14302	Sean	Sure, Elliot...yeah....
14303	J.D.'s Narration	If you're lucky, there's no battle at all everything works out perfectly.
14304	J.D.	Yo, there he is! For a second I thought you weren't coming, dude.
14305	Bartender	Hey! Turk-&-J.D.! And J.D.!
14306	J.D.	Yeah, I'm so psyched we're doing this, man.
14307	Turk	So am I.
14308	Todd	'Scuse me for a second, fellas. I'm gonna go over there and tell that girl my name's "Beer," then I'm gonna offer her some "beer nuts"! What's up!
14309	Todd	Mental five.
14310	J.D.	You invited The Todd?
14311	Turk	Dude, we left at the same time. I didn't know what to say to him.
14312	J.D.	But I thought we were gonna, like, reminisce tonight, you know? Get a little deep?
14313	Turk	Me too. I'm totally bummed out, all right?
14314	Todd	Oh, that was the hottest slap I've ever gotten! I can't believe I wasn't gonna come out tonight! Thanks for twisting my arm.
14315	J.D.	I'm outta here.
14316	Todd	Hey!
14317	Turk	J.D. Come on, man! All right, fine, man! I could have plenty of deep moments with The Todd!
14318	Todd	Hey. You think gay dudes get turned on by their own wieners?
14319	Turk	Oh, my God.
14320	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14321	J.D.'s Narration	I wanted to let Turk know exactly how I felt about the way he behaved, so I decided to throw him Mr. Quinn's chart with a little extra mustard sauce!

14323	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14324	J.D.	I apologize for that. To you. Not you!
14325	J.D.	Nor you!
14326	Dr. Cox	Oh, hey, this whole you-leaving-the-room-whenever-I-enter-it thing that you're doing is just...I love it!
14327	Turk	Ever since I got engaged, he's been acting crazier than my fiancee. Although...Carla is going a little nuts about the dress. Dude, what's up with Tracy?
14328	Mr. Quinn	Dude! Tracy's a guy.
14329	Turk	That'd make you gay.
14330	Mr. Quinn	I am gay.
14331	Turk	...Neat!

14337	Elliot	Just...give me another chance?
14338	Sean	Well, I kind of already have plans tonight...
14339	Sean	...with this girl, Betty...from work.

14348	Wendy	Sure.
14349	Carla	Thanks.
14350	Dr. Kelso	Nurse Espinosa. I specifically requested that you transfer Mrs. Merchant to the Morning Side Nursing Home. I'd take her there myself, but then I'd run the risk of bumping into my mother, and the last thing I need is to have another conversation about why she shouldn't have to spend her golden years in a bunk-bed. Now, either do the job we pay you for, or I'll find someone else who will!

14369	J.D.	Oh, nothing I just found out my favorite chips cause anal leakage and, oh, I'm not talking to you.
14370	Dr. Cox	How did you get him to stop talking to you?
14371	J.D.	I don't get it, man. All I wanted to do was take you to dinner, and you made me feel like a total idiot.
14372	Dr. Cox	Wait a minute, I _always_ make him feel like an idiot.
14373	Turk	Why you making a big deal about this?
14374	J.D.	You never tell me how you feel!
14375	Dr. Cox	Aw, dammit all! I never tell you how _I_ feel.
14376	J.D.	I'm not talking to you!
14377	Dr. Cox	Finally! Thank you.
14378	J.D.	I don't understand. Ever since I met you it's been like this one-way street. I mean, I-I-I-I tell you everything, and you tell me nothing. I don't get it what are you afraid of?

14383	Elliot	Soooo...thanks to you, Sean blew me off; but I'm okay. Old Elliot would have gone into a tail-spin, but new Elliot's just gonna get him back, because new Elliot is a fixer. Like, that guy over there if his stitches lifted and his spleen ruptured, I would just go over...and fix them!
14384	Guy	My spleen is going to rupture!?
14385	Elliot	Relax, you're fine.
14386	Elliot	You know what? I am just going to show Sean that he will always come first.
14387	Dr. Cox	Gosh, I hate to interrupt this one-gal pep-rally, there, Barbie, but I give this guy two weeks three if you are just terrific in the sack.
14388	Elliot	Well, then it's three!
14389	Dr. Cox	Mm!
14390	Elliot	I mean: You're wrong!
14391	Dr. Cox	You know I just, uh, I just got off the phone with Jordan, who told me that my son rolled over for the first time....
14392	Elliot	Oh, my God! That's so great!
14393	Dr. Cox	Big who cares! Not about Jack rolling over for the first time, but definitely about your reaction to my son rolling over for the first time. Point being that I missed it because I was here. You might want to get a pen out and write this down, because here comes the inside scoop: The hospital comes first. Always.
14394	Elliot	Always?
14395	Dr. Cox	Forever and ever.
14396	Dr. Cox	D'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand everandeverandeverandever You gettin' this? Aaaand everandeverandeverandeveraneverandever....
14397	Tracy	So I'll pick you up tomorrow, okay?
14398	Mr. Quinn	Okay.
14399	Tracy	All right.
14400	Dr. Cox	...and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever, andeverandeverandeverandever....
14401	Mr. Quinn	You're not that comfortable with the man-on-man action, are you?
14402	Turk	So I'm a little homophobic.... I mean, we all got our stuff, right? I bet, deep down inside, you're a little racist?
14403	Mr. Quinn	Marrying a black guy?
14404	Turk	Dude, how pissed are your parents, honestly?
14405	Mr. Quinn	So, what makes you so uncomfortable? Is it the sex?
14406	Turk	Don't get me wrong I don't love the idea of kissing anyone with a mustache. That's why I always pretend to have a cold when Carla's aunt comes to town.
14407	Turk	What really freaks me out, though, is the thought of being that open with another guy any guy. I don't know what it is, I mean that's just the way I been my whole life. Maybe...maybe it's because I'm scared, you know?
14408	Mr. Quinn	Dude...that's a little gay.
14409	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14410	Carla	What?
14411	Janitor	Nurse Espinosa, I feel bad about what happened before; and so I went and searched through like forty bags of garbage.... And I found the torn off urine label. Also found half a tooth.
14412	Nurse Roberts	Over here, jumpsuit!
14413	Carla	Mr. Thomasberg, let's get you to the lab!
14414	Dr. Cox	Hey, studly! Now, when you were out rooting through the dumpster, you didn't stumble across your own testicles, did'ja?
14415	Janitor	Hey, you know that long line of trembling peons that are so afraid of you? Well I'm not in that line.
14416	Dr. Cox	Oh, you're not?
14417	Janitor	No. I'm not in anybody's line.
14418	Nurse Roberts	_This_ is a Chicklet!
14419	Janitor	I gotta go.
14420	J.D.'s Narration	I'm always happy when someone wins a battle. Because around here, you get your fair share of disappointment.
14421	J.D.'s Narration	I guess in the end you have to fight for things that really matter. Like pride in your work...
14422	J.D.'s Narration	...or your friendship.
14423	Turk	You know, I'm actually starting to like Journey.
14424	J.D.	Well you're gonna be very pleased with the next twenty-three songs.
14425	Turk	Heh.
14426	J.D.	You know, the fact that you're even here for an end-of-an-era celebration is enough we don't have to, like, get all deep or anything.
14427	Turk	No, I wanna try this, man. Okay, Um.... Ever since Carla and I set the date for the wedding, I started thinking. You know those lame-ass couples that get engaged but they never actually get married they just cruise along, year after year, without making any real kind of commitment?
14428	J.D.	Uh-huh?
14429	Turk	Dude, I wanted to be one of those couples, man!
14430	J.D.	Hey, Puki, can we get two appletinis, please?
14431	J.D.'s Narration	And sometimes, all you can do is grit your teeth and tell the truth.
14432	Sean	Hey.
14433	Elliot	Look, I was planning on coming here and telling you that you'll always come first. But, the truth is that's not a promise I can keep. But the one thing I _can_ guarantee you is that, when it's my decision, I'll always choose you. ...But if that's not enough, I understand.

14439	Sean	I'm gonna be hearing about this all day.
14440	J.D.'s Narration	Dr. Cox and Jordan are still looking for a pediatrician....
14441	Dr. Cox	This time, try not to scare off the doctor.
14442	Jordan	I did not scare off the last guy!
14443	Dr. Cox	You bit him.
14444	Jordan	I _tripped_ and my teeth hit his shoulder.
14445	Dr. Cox	Uh-huh. And once that happened, did you clamp down a little bit?
14446	Dr. Cox	Jordan!
14447	Jordan	Well
14448	Dr. Cox	Oh, you come on!
14449	Jordan	Well, he had a bad attitude!
14450	Dr. Norris	Zachary, remember what Mr. Cookiepants always says about blowing your nose: "If it's clear, have no fear; if it's bloody, come see your buddy!" What do you want?
14451	Jordan	Well, we're looking for a new pediatrician for our son....
14452	Dr. Norris	And you figured that, even though my patient load is full, since you're on the board of directors and Dr. Cox here is not only an attending at the hospital but also an internationally renowned pain-in-the-ass, you both could show complete disregard for my schedule and make me want to cause you grievous bodily harm even before we were properly introduced...?
14453	Jordan	Charmed.
14454	J.D.'s Narration	Like I said: Same ol', same ol'.
14455	Janitor	Heh-hah-hah. You drew on the wall. You drew on the wall!
14456	J.D.	You pulled the paper away!
14457	Janitor	Stop lyin'. It's gonna come off, right?
14458	J.D.	Dan, don't! That's dad's indelible space pen! And prom is in like two weeks!
14459	J.D.	Good evening Mr. and Mrs. Shefford. I'm...here to pick up Amy for...prom.
14460	J.D.	Yeah, that that'll come off you won't have to get laser surgery or skin from your ass or anything.

14466	Sean	Well, I've, uh, I've got whales to train.
14467	J.D.	Stupid whales.
14468	J.D.	Hey, Sean! Right on, brother!
14469	Sean	Bye.
14470	Elliot	Bye!
14471	Turk	Where the hell are my interns!?
14472	J.D.'s Narration	As third-year residents, you really have to stay on top of your interns.
14473	Turk	These! Right here! You see these names!? They are called patients! This one needs brain work! This one needs a heart!
14474	J.D.	This guy needs courage.
14475	Turk	Helping or hurting, J.D.? Helping or hurting?
14476	Interns	Yes, Dr. Turk.
14477	Female Intern	Dr. Jerk!
14478	J.D.	The girl one just called you "Dr. Jerk"!
14479	Turk	No sweat. You should hear what they call Dr. Michead.
14480	J.D.	...What?
14481	J.D.'s Narration	I decided to take a different tack with my interns.
14482	J.D.	Look, guys, I'm not here to overwork ya, okay? I'm not I'm not just your resident I'm your buddy, I'm your go-to guy.... I'm J.D.
14483	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, my tack had its own drawbacks.
14484	J.D.	But it is crucial I have everyone here at 9 a.m. sharp tomorrow, okay?
14485	Intern 1	Oh, uh...is it cool if I come at 9:30?
14486	J.D.	Absolutely. Anyone else need to be late?
14487	Intern 2	I can't.
14488	Intern 3	Bad for me.
14489	J.D.	Okay, well, why don't we why don't we just make it 10, then? Okay?
14490	Intern 4	I can be here at 9.
14491	J.D.	But I said 10!
14492	J.D.'s Narration	I guess everyone has their own style.
14493	Elliot	Today for lunch, the cafeteria has... Bruce, name a manifestation of normal pressure hydrocephalus!
14494	Bruce	Urinary incontinence!
14495	Elliot	He-hell yes, Bruce! Go place a Foley cath. On Bed 4! As for the rest of Team E, I'm
14496	Dr. Kelso	Well, if it isn't Dr. Haircut and her not-ready-for-primetime players!
14497	Elliot	Actually, sir, we rock, so feel free to sit back and enjoy the show!
14498	Dr. Kelso	Well, don't worry about it, son, those things are a dime a dozen.
14499	Bruce	Really?
14500	Dr. Kelso	In fact, if you get bored, why don't you just hijack an ice cream truck and drive it through our brand new pathology lab? But do me a favor and spare the paper shredder, because I'll need that to turn your next twelve paychecks into a clown wig you can wear for the rest of your internship!
14501	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Reid, you may have an exciting new look and a boyfriend who smells vaguely like my tackle-box, but I remain, as always, underwhelmed.
14502	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14503	Dr. Cox	I think, Dr. Norris, what we're looking for is someone who's not too alarmist but also not too lax, either.
14504	Dr. Norris	Oh, God, please let that someone be me!
14505	Jordan	Look, you're obviously a little busy with your doll....
14506	Dr. Norris	My doll? It's a collectible.
14507	Jordan	Someone's gonna get his ass bit!
14508	Dr. Cox	Right.... I think we should probably take off. We're gonna be back to you with our decision.
14509	Dr. Norris	Super. I'll be by my giant pretend phone, pretending to give a crap.
14510	Oh, uh, by the way	Brrring! Helloo? Gotta take it. Uh-huh.... Uh-huh....
14511	Dr. Cox	I love him!
14512	Jordan	Of course you do he's you! And nobody loves you more than you! You know that.
14513	Dr. Cox	Yeah, but, still.... He _is_ the best pediatrician on staff, and since we both work here we're gonna have a lot of pull over him. I mean, come on, Jordan, you haven't let me make one decision about our son. Which is why, by the way, you'll be doing the answering when he asks why daddy's wee-wee doesn't have a turtleneck on it like his.
14514	Jordan	Yeah, fine. Whatever you said.
14515	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14516	J.D.	Hey, Carla? Hey.... I had to redo the NG tube one of your nurses put on Mrs. Hemmel, so if you could spread the word to leave that to me and my guys, it would be great.
14517	Carla	Oh, no problem, Bambi. Oh! But the reason my nurses had to do that is because none of your interns know how. So if you keep flapping your mouth without knowing all the facts, I'm gonna see if I can fit my foot in it!
14518	J.D.	Okay. Good talk!
14519	Brian	You did it for me both times.
14520	J.D.	Jimmy, didn't you do one yesterday?
14521	Jimmy	No, you let me go home 'cause I forgot to set my TiVo for the Styx 'Behind the Music'?
14522	J.D.	Do not miss that! It's awesome! Seth?
14523	J.D.'s Narration	That was when I realized what I'd turned my interns into.
14524	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14525	Elliot	Bruce! This is gonna be your third Foley cath. in a row! You can do this. You didn't need to page me seventeen times between the time I bought the rum-raisin muffin and then...threw it away because alcoholism runs in my family.
14526	Bruce	After this morning, I just wanted to make sure that I _really_ have this down.
14527	Elliot	What are you doing?
14528	Bruce	It's just a nervous habit. It helps me concentrate.
14529	Elliot	Yeah, well, you know what helps me concentrate?
14530	Bruce	Me not doing that?
14531	Elliot	No, bunnies.
14532	Elliot	Mmm.
14533	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14534	Dr. Cox	Say, I don't want to embarrass you, there, Big Jack, but, uh...you've got a little something on your face.
14535	Dr. Cox	Hardly notice it.
14536	Jordan	What was that?
14537	Dr. Cox	Come on, Jordan. Don't tell me you're gonna be one of those parents who makes a big deal out of every single cough.
14538	Dr. Cox	Look out, Michead!
14539	Dr. Michead	Argh!
14540	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14541	Janitor	Okay, tough guy. Good night!
14542	Janitor	What the!? Maybe I diluted this too much.
14543	Doug	Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaagggggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
14544	Janitor	Eh, can't blame the cleanser.
14545	J.D.'s Narration	Even though my interns sucked, I decided to turn it into a positive.
14546	J.D.	Elliot, uh, I need some pointers on how to deal with my interns.
14547	Doug	....aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagggggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh-hagh-haaaaaaaaaaaaggggggggghhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!....
14548	&	Hey, Doug.
14549	J.D.	Anyway, do you think we could, like, meet up after work or something?
14550	Elliot	Sure. What'd you have in mind?
14551	Sean	No! Don't do it!
14552	J.D.	Nothin' major.
14553	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14554	Dr. Norris	You know, Benjamin, it's not a bad thing that you play with it, it's just that your mom wants you to take breaks for meals!
14555	Dr. Cox	Excuse me, Jack here, uh, Jack here's got a cough. And on account of the meconium problem he had at birth, I'm thinking it just might be pneumonia.
14556	Dr. Norris	Benjamin: Take this cup, fill 'er up, right?
14557	Dr. Norris	What in the hell do you think you are doing? You arrogant son of a bitch, if you ever interrupt an exam of mine again, I will personally take my stethoscope and shove it up your
14558	Dr. Norris	Benjamin! What happened?
14559	Benjamin	I don't have to go.
14560	Dr. Norris	Oh, well it happens to the big boys, too. Try again. Go on!
14561	Dr. Norris	Is his temperature under a hundred-point-five?
14562	Dr. Cox	Barely.
14563	Dr. Norris	Eating, peeing, pooing?
14564	Dr. Cox	Sometimes all at the same time. Come on, it's a really persistent cough. What do you say?
14565	Dr. Norris	Office hours, tomorrow, 5 o'clock. Bye-bye.
14566	Dr. Cox	I'm gonna go ahead and put this in a language that you can understand: You had better see my son now, or I'm gonna kick your ass.
14567	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14568	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, here she comes. Don't be over-eager!
14569	J.D.	Elliot!!! Over here!!!
14570	Elliot	Hey!
14571	J.D.	Wow...you look great.
14572	Elliot	Thanks.
14573	Sean	Oh, hey, J.D.
14574	J.D.	Hey, Sean's here, everybody.... Hey, Sean! Heeeyyy!
14575	Elliot	You know, since he's a trainer, Sean is really good with behavior and communication. I mean, he helped me so much with my interns that I thought maybe he could help you with yours.
14576	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, stay calm at least she's here, too.
14577	Elliot	Oh, Bruce again gotta go.
14578	Sean	Mm-hmm.
14579	Sean	Bye.
14580	Sean	This'll be fun!
14581	J.D.'s Narration	And just like that, I had another rough night ahead of me.
14582	J.D.'s Narration	At least I wasn't the only one.
14583	Elliot	You paged me for another Foley catheter?
14584	Bruce	I'm great at these now!
14585	Elliot	Oh!
14586	Bruce	Just watch this one.
14587	Dr. Kelso	Don't mind if I do!
14588	J.D.'s Narration	Yep, it's gonna be a long, long night.
14589	Elliot	I'm, heh, right here, Bruce.

14591	Dr. Cox	Hello, David. I've been expecting you.
14592	Dr. Norris	Agh!
14593	Dr. Cox	Yeah, I just thought I'd come by and play with some of your stuffed animals and, I know, I know, they're "for the kids", heh. Also, wanted to let you know that I _will_ be bringing my son by this _morning_.
14594	Dr. Norris	Yeah, I don't think so, there, chief.
14595	Dr. Norris	Where's Mr. Cookiepants?
14596	Dr. Cox	Oh, que pasa?
14597	Dr. Norris	I said, Where's Mr. Cookiepants!?
14598	Dr. Cox	He's in a safe place, Dave.
14599	Dr. Norris	If you touch one hair on his head, I swear to God I'll inject your kid with chickenpox!
14600	Dr. Cox	No, you won't.
14601	Dr. Norris	I know.
14602	Dr. Cox	No, David. It's a collectible.
14603	Dr. Norris	Whatever.
14604	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14605	Elliot	The kid's a good doctor, he just...falls apart every time Kelso looks over his shoulder.
14606	Sean	Well, why don't you just tell Kelso to back off?
14607	Elliot	I-I've taken a lot of positive steps this year but when it comes to standing up to Kelso, I just...I can't get over that hump yet. He's like my white whale.
14608	Sean	Yeah.... Mine's Frank.
14609	Elliot	Oh, no, I meant like in 'Moby Dick' Kelso is a giant pain in my ass.
14610	Sean	Oh. Well, thing is, I love Frank. Just...he can drive me crazy every now and then.
14611	Sean	Every day! Every day! ...Every day!
14612	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14613	Sean	Hey, J.D.? I was thinking we'd start out by me, you know, watching how you interact with your interns. Uh, and then, you kn your brain's gonna tell you to be a little self-conscious, but you just need to ignore the voice in your head.
14614	J.D.'s Thoughts	Kick him in the crotch and run.
14615	J.D.	I'll try, Sean!
14616	Elliot	You be nice to the teacher, okay? I'm sleeping with him.
14617	Elliot	Oh, my God! I haven't said that since college!
14618	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14619	Dr. Cox	Mmmmgh! Norris hasn't budged, and he just moved the appointment back to six, the rat-bastard!
14620	Jordan	Watch your language in front of the kid, you stupid bicky-bicky!
14621	Jordan	You see, _I_ am adapting. You, on the other hand, are behaving like a complete lunatic.
14622	Dr. Cox	No, I'm not!
14623	Jordan	Carla?
14624	Carla	Hm?
14625	Jordan	You're one of them bossy-pants types who always tells people their problems whether they ask for it or not, right?
14626	Carla	I like to think I've learned when to hold back.
14627	Jordan	You're in.
14628	Carla	You've totally lost sight of what's important, here. You are a parent now, okay? You don't come first anymore
14629	Jordan	No.
14630	Carla	you've got to do what's best for your son, even if it means sucking up to the one doctor on earth who's more obnoxious than you are.
14631	Jordan	Well....
14632	Carla	Oh, my God. I loved doing that so much, it makes my hand shake a little!
14633	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14634	Elliot	So, how are your interns doing?
14635	Doug	Hey, yeah, it still burns a little, but at least I can hear okay.
14636	Dr. Kelso	Fantastic, sport. But that's the brachial artery and it's not how we draw blood. Now, if we need to inject him with heroin, you'll be the first one I call.
14637	Elliot	Dr. Kelso...
14638	Dr. Kelso	What is it, Dr. Reid? Do you have something to say?
14639	Elliot	...No.
14640	Dr. Kelso	You know, son, you remind me of her so much, you're just a break-down in the supply closet away from being the same person!
14641	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14642	J.D.	Look, Brian, if you're having that much trouble with your case report, I'd be glad to take a look at it for you, pal.
14643	Brian	Cool. Try to have it back by 5.
14644	J.D.	O...kay. I have a lot of things to do...but....
14645	Sean	Hey, J.D.? Can I offer a little constructive criticism?
14646	J.D.'s Thoughts	Kick him in the crotch, dammit! The crotch!
14647	Sean	You know, you're worried so much about whether your interns like you or not that I don't think they respect you very much.
14648	Turk	I had one of mine run out this morning and get me some dome wax. Check it zing!
14649	Sean	That's really shiny.
14650	Turk	Yeah!
14651	Sean	You know, I had the same problem when I started working with the dolphins
14652	J.D.	Okay, that's it. I-I-I'm sorry, Sean, I'm a doctor, okay? I-I'm teaching humans, not dolphins, okay? So it isn't really helpful for me to know what works on fish.
14653	Sean	They're mammals, actually.
14654	J.D.	Oh, well, Sean! Unfortunately for me, my interns aren't mammals!
14655	Sean	J.D., they are.
14656	J.D.	S-sh I don't care, Sean!
14657	J.D.	Come on, Turk!
14658	Turk	Hey. I just wanted you to know I don't have a problem with you, I just can't resist a good storm-off.
14659	Sean	Oh, who can?
14660	Janitor	Stain, I won't lie to ya this is gonna hurt a little bit.
14661	Turk	Why don't you just paint over it?
14662	Janitor	Hm!
14663	J.D.	Can you believe that crap Sean was saying?
14664	Turk	He was right. Even in college, you cared way too much about everybody liking you.
14665	Guy	Hey, who wants to help me move?
14666	J.D.	Me!
14667	Girl	J.D., could you walk my dog tonight while I have casual sex with your friend, Miguel?
14668	J.D.	Love to!
14669	Same Guy	Hey. Who wants to help me move back?
14670	J.D.	I know where it all goes...!
14671	Turk	Think about it, man. Cox has taught you the most since you've been here, right? Do you really think he gives a damn whether you like him or not?
14672	J.D.	I'd like to think so.
14673	Dr. Cox	Out of my way, space-waster!
14674	Turk	I felt the love.
14675	J.D.'s Thoughts	Catch him and kick him in his junk!
14676	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14677	Dr. Cox	Enjoy.
14678	Dr. Norris	Well, if you want, you could give that one to me and I could fix it. And have it...for the kids.
14679	Dr. Cox	Disturbing fetishes aside, I I feel like I owe you an apology on account of acting like a jackass. But I don't think that my son should be the one who has to pay for it.
14680	Dr. Norris	You actually think that I would endanger the health of a child because you're a jackass? Look, buddy, most of the parents I deal with are jackasses; now, don't get me wrong, you're in the top five.
14681	Dr. Cox	Thank you!
14682	Dr. Norris	You're welcome. So, the reason why I have yet to see your child is because he has the sniffles.
14683	Dr. Cox	The sniffles?
14684	Dr. Norris	The sniffles! Look, you're a doctor, you have what I like to call The Burden of Knowledge you're gonna be worse than every parent who freaks out because their kid eats Play-Doh. Why? Because you've seen too much; you've seen what can really go wrong. If you can get a handle on that, it's gonna gross you.
14685	Dr. Cox	You have kids?
14686	Dr. Norris	One. She hates dolls.
14687	Dr. Cox	Boy, that's a bummer.
14688	Dr. Norris	Tell me about it.
14689	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14690	Dr. Kelso	That's horrible work. Horrible!
14691	Elliot	Dr. Kelso, I do have something to say.
14692	Elliot	Remember earlier, you asked me if I had something to say?
14693	Dr. Kelso	No!
14694	Elliot	Well, you did. And...the reason that I came back here is because you said that Bruce and I are alike. And you know what? You're right. Because you're treating him the exact same way you treated me when I first got here!
14695	Dr. Kelso	Is that how you feel, future dentist?
14696	Bruce	W-well...sometimes you make me feel like...I can't do anything well, and I can do lots of things well!
14697	Dr. Kelso	Like what?
14698	Bruce	I'm a pretty solid human beat-box.
14699	Elliot	Bru-Bruce, I think he was talking about medical...things.
14700	Dr. Kelso	No, no-no, I-I'd like to hear him demonstrate this "beef-box" thing.
14701	Bruce	Well well, o-okay. Uh, I g I guess this one goes out to my boy, Wayne, in room 302. He has fluid in his lungs.
14702	Dr. Kelso	Young man! ...Enjoy your moment.
14703	Elliot	Oh, my God, Bruce! That was amazing! Where did you learn how to do that?
14704	Bruce	In temple.

14706	Sean	You're right I can totally see my reflection!
14707	Turk	Tell your friends, baby!
14708	J.D.	Hey, Sean, you were right about me and my interns. I guess I owe you an apology.
14709	Carla	Damn straight, you do! You know what your problem is, Bambi? You're
14710	Carla	Oh! Turk! Please? Just one more second? I need the rush! Please?
14711	Sean	J.D., it's no big deal. We both know that it wasn't about that. Well, you...you like Elliot.
14712	J.D.	Sorry.
14713	Sean	Don't sweat it.
14714	J.D.	You're not pissed off? I'd be pissed off. Why aren't you pissed off?
14715	Sean	I dunno. I guess I just...I don't see you as that much of a threat.
14716	J.D.	Ohh.... Cool.
14717	J.D.'s Narration	I don't care. All that matters is finding a way to sleep at night.
14718	J.D.'s Narration	...painting over your black spot...
14719	J.D.'s Narration	...or imagining Shamu taking Sean's arm off.
14720	J.D.'s Narration	You don't need a doctor to tell you that a good night's sleep can fix almost anything.
14721	Bruce's refrain	He's got fluid.
14722	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14723	J.D.'s Narration	Hospitals are hectic. But there's a certain time every morning, after the bedpans have been emptied, that a calm washes over the place; and you can't help but feel peaceful.
14724	J.D.	Holy Vishnu! Look, we've been working together a while, could you not whistle at me?
14725	Dr. Cox	You're right, Newbie, we have been working together for a while. Of course, I wouldn't know the exact number of days unless I consulted my Friends For Life calendar that I keep taped inside my hope chest. Still....
14726	J.D.'s Narration	I've learned to make Dr. Cox's rants work for me.
14727	J.D.'s Narration	I catch up on paperwork; I look after patients...
14728	J.D.	Carla, can you check room air pulse ox on Mrs. Shipp?
14729	Carla	You got it, Bambi.
14730	J.D.'s Narration	...I take care of those official things that just have to get done.
14731	Janitor	You're a jerk.
14732	J.D.	_You're_ a jerk!
14733	Dr. Cox	...Long story short, there, Molly, I will always whistle at you like you're a blonde with big bombs and I'm a construction worker just released from prison. That clear?
14734	J.D.	Crystal!
14735	Dr. Cox	Super!
14736	J.D.	Uh, listen, while I have you here I'm applying for a fellowship, and I could really use a letter of recommendation. I was thinking that, when you wrote it, instead of using a girl's name you could refer to me as "Dr. Dorian." I think it sounds a little more professional and, frankly, each time you call me a girl's name, I die a little inside.
14737	Dr. Cox	Look, Janice, Denise, Tiffany Amber Thiiiieeeessen! Lemme go ahead and share a little something special with you that I like to call Perry's Perspective. One: If someone's standing in front of me in line at the coffee shop and they can't decide what they want in the half an hour it took to get to the register, I should be allowed to kill them. Two: I'm fairly sure if they took porn off the internet, there'd only be one website left, and it'd be called "Bring back the porn!" Three and most importantly of all: The only way to be respected as a doctor nay, respected as a man is to be an island; you are born alone, you damn sure die alone. Isn't that right, spike?
14738	Dr. Cox	The point is, and you just might want to jot this down: only the weak need help.
14739	J.D.	I should get that tattooed on my neck.
14740	Dr. Kelso	Good afternoon, Sacred Heart!
14741	Dr. Steadman	Hey! Your Chief of Medicine just said good afternoon, people!
14742	J.D.'s Narration	Dr. Jeffrey Steadman world-class suck-up. Especially since the residency director position opened up.
14743	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Cox, you know Dr. Steadman.
14744	Dr. Cox	You're a doctor? Here, all this time I had thought that you were some kind of parasitic creature who lived shoulder-deep inside Big Bob's colon.
14745	Dr. Steadman	If only, sir.
14746	J.D.	Well, I'm off to fluid rounds.
14747	J.D.	To fluid rounds!
14748	Elliot	Mm! In the new Sea World dolphin show, Sean opens with this impression of a blowfish that will totally crack you guys up! Show them.
14749	Sean	All right.
14750	J.D.	What the hell, that's not funny! All he did was this
14751	Sean	Hey, you're not doing it right.
14752	J.D.'s Narration	It's never fun being the fifth wheel, especially when one of those wheels is Elliot's boyfriend. Still, I had decided to take the high road.
14753	Sean	Hey, J.D., is this regular? I asked you to bring me a diet.
14754	J.D.	That is diet....
14755	Sean	I don't understand! I'm so careful about what I eat, I'm I just keep putting on weight!
14756	Elliot	It's all the regular soda, Sean!
14757	J.D.	Enjoy.

14759	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14760	Sean	So, I'm leaving the day after tomorrow, uh, to work on this project studying the fishing industry's impact on Maui dolphins. Uh, they're an endangered species; if something isn't done soon they could actually be wiped off the face of the earth.

14767	Sean's Ex	Nice to see you, Sean.

14769	J.D.'s Thoughts	Goodbye, boys....
14770	Sean	You know, it's always awkward when you run into an ex, isn't it?
14771	Turk	Tell me about it. I don't know how J.D. and Elliot do it.
14772	Sean	Do what?
14773	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, no! I've got to stop this! Kick him!
14774	Carla	Oh!
14775	Turk	You okay, baby?
14776	Carla	Yeah....

14786	Janitor	Troy! We're listening.
14787	J.D.	Two coins add up to thirty cents and one of them is not a nickel.
14788	Janitor	So what are they?
14789	J.D.	It's a _riddle_. You figure it out.

14800	Carla	No!
14801	Carla	Green scrubs!
14802	Turk	Ohhhh.
14803	Carla	I'm covering for one of the surgical nurses. We could use the extra cash, plus we get to work side-by-side for the next two whole days. Isn't that great!
14804	Turk	So great!

14806	Turk	So ......

14808	Elliot	So, J.D. and I slept together. It's not that big a deal.
14809	Sean	You know Betty from work I see her every day, right? How would you feel if I told you _we_ slept together?
14810	Elliot	Well, I'd be disturbed, Sean, because Betty is a harp seal.
14811	Sean	Yeah, but a harp seal who's smart, funny, and totally gets me!
14812	Elliot	Oh, my God! Is anyone in more hell than me right now?
14813	Todd	Dude. We're goin' to the caf. so I can tell all the boys about my date with Strangely Attractive Intern! You in?

14820	Dr. Cox	I'm sure we're gonna be in touch with you real soon.
14821	Dr. Cox	Our nanny just walked out the door. Gimme a break she's experienced, she has great credentials....
14822	Jordan	Oh, no, no, she's got great, huge, perky credentials. She's out. Besides, she's too expensive.
14823	Dr. Cox	About that, now, um, I've actually been thinking about going after that residency director job.
14824	Jordan	Residency director?
14825	Dr. Cox	Yeah-heah!
14826	Jordan	But Perry, you realize if you did that, you would be taking a positive step in your life.
14827	Dr. Cox	I...I know.
14828	Jordan	Quick: First place we made love?
14829	Dr. Cox	Oh, gimme a break. We've never..."_made love_".
14830	Jordan	Whew, it is you. I'm so proud I could poo.
14831	Dr. Cox	No, no!
14832	Jordan	Yes!
14833	Dr. Cox	No! I'm serious, Jordan, I don't believe in it. I'd make you swear on a Bible, but I know how contact with holy stuff makes your skin sizzle. So just...promise me?
14834	Jordan	Oh, fine no help.
14835	Dr. Cox	Great.

14843	Elliot	Okay, yes! J.D. and I work together! But it's not like we're crazy close! I mean, it's not like we have all these inside jokes! And we definitely don't do this....
14844	J.D.	Good evening, Elliot! This is your great aunt Sally. Are you there?
14845	Elliot	I have to get that.
14846	Sean	Nuh-uh.
14847	J.D.	I guess you're at Sean's. Hey, good thing we're so crazy close, or I wouldn't know how to impersonate your aunt Sally! By the way, I ran into Eye Patch this morning said to tell you, "Honka! Honka!"
14848	Elliot	It's just an inside...joke.

14853	Troy	Relax! I figured it out.
14854	Janitor	Okay.... You gave me a penny...and...what appears to be a button, on which you've written twenty-nine cents.
14855	Troy	Can't we just kill him?

14860	Dr. Cox	Fair enough. I'm gonna go ahead and write you a prescription for two testicles; and you feel free to get this filled out whenever you want
14861	Dr. Cox	but right now, I'm goin' after that residency director gig, and you're joining me for a really stupid board member meet-and-greet.
14862	J.D.	Will you write my recommendation?
14863	Dr. Cox	Oh, hell no!
14864	J.D.	Goodbye.
14865	Dr. Cox	Oh, gimme a break! I'll write whatever you want! Just...we gotta go.

14877	Turk	Nothing! She meant _her_ waxer, 'cause we're ...We're working, guys.
14878	Dr. Wen	No, no, no. I wanna hear this.
14879	Carla	It's no big deal. I make Turk wax his chest so he doesn't give me a rash.

14884	Elliot	I'm sorry, okay? I didn't tell you that I slept with J.D. and that was a mistake. And, yes, we do talk all the time and have all these inside jokes, and he met my great aunt Sally when she came to the hospital with my demented great uncle who wears an eye patch and goes "honka! honka!" when he poops.
14885	Elliot	And now you hate me.
14886	Sean	Elliot, I don't...I don't hate you. Okay? I'm I'm not even that mad at you.
14887	Elliot	You're not?
14888	Sean	No. How do I explain this.... You know when you have really bad news to give to someone? So you try to make them look like the bad guy by taking a small thing and blowing it way out of proportion?
14889	Elliot	Totally. So glad that has nothing to do with us!
14890	Sean	Elliot, the trip that I'm leaving on tomorrow...it's actually a lot longer than I let on.

14900	Man	So, the wife and I ended up buying Egyptian cotton bed sheets!
14901	Dr. Cox	Gee, you're too much. What's the thread count on those bad boys?

14905	Dr. Kelso	You're not actually applying for residency director.
14906	Dr. Cox	Oh, I don't know, Bob. Here, I like to think I've accomplished plenty of things much more difficult than this. Why, just yesterday morning I somehow managed to hack into your voice-mail and change the outgoing message to, "Hi, this is Big Bob. Why, I'm not in right now but, at the beep, leave your name and your penis size!"
14907	Dr. Kelso	Perry, have you ever wondered why you've never risen above clinical staff at this hospital? I mean, come on, pal, who do you think the board listens to concerning promotions around here? Why don't I tell you after the beep?

14915	Turk	I know, right!
14916	Carla	Yeah!
14917	Turk	But you know what? Schmitty heard that Nurse Green's been dying to cover surgery, and I said you wouldn't mind if she took your place tomorrow. Because, between me and you, Schmitty's been trying to hit that for like a minute, and I had to hook him up! You understand, right?
14918	Carla	Sure. Mm-hmm. I'm...I'm glad we could help Schmitty hit that!
14919	Turk	Yeah.
14920	J.D.'s Narration	Relationships can be tricky. Especially the ones that have barely begun.
14921	Sean	Look, Elliot, I'm crazy about you, but I've been going over this in my head all week. I've been in a long-distance relationship before, and it was a disaster. I've reached the point where I honestly believe a couple has a better chance if they just cut the cord and know that if it's meant to be, fate will bring them back together. You know?
14922	Elliot	Yeah.... Totally....
14923	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14924	J.D.'s Thoughts	It's typical. Elliot's in a relationship, so I can't stop thinking about her. I just have to accept it and move on.

14936	Turk	Gastric bypass?
14937	Dr. Wen	Mm-hmm.
14938	Turk	I'm goin' to the show?
14939	Dr. Wen	Well, you've earned it you really turned it up a notch in surgery yesterday. I don't know if you had a lucky charm in that room, or what, but something was different.
14940	Turk	Hey! Hey, Baby! What's up? You know, I've been thinking: that _was_ a lot of fun working together.
14941	Carla	Mm-hmmmm. And how long you been thinking about that?
14942	Turk	Ever since Dr. Wen offered me a gastric bypass because I was so amazing yesterday, and I realized you're the reason why.
14943	Carla	Really?
14944	Turk	Yeah! Yeah. It's just like in high school I had this girlfriend who annoyed the crap out of me, but every time she came to one of my basketball games, I played like crazy out of my mind because all of a sudden I was playing for her. I wanted to make her proud. You understand what I'm saying?
14945	Carla	You're saying I'm so annoying you can't stand working with me for even two days, but now that you have something to gain, you want me back.
14946	Turk	Exactly. Thank you!
14947	Carla	I didn't hear an apology anywhere in there!
14948	Nurse Roberts	All I heard was nonsense.
14949	Turk	The truth is, you never asked me how I felt about us working together. Plus, you embarrassed me in front of my co-workers. You were a pain.
14950	Carla	You know what? Maybe I was a pain, but do you know how many times you're a pain and I just let it go? Like when we're at home and you follow me from room to room, even when I go to the bathroom!
14951	Turk	I like to be with you.
14952	Carla	Pain!
14953	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14954	Carla	Don't.

14957	Carla	Laverne!
14958	Turk's Recording	"I don't know much / but I know I love you ooh ooh ooh."
14959	Carla	But the biggest pain of all is that you know I'd go into that operating room with you if you just apologized; but you're too stubborn to do that, aren't you.
14960	Turk	I am now!
14961	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
14962	Dr. Cox	Tell me this, there, pippy: Are you allergic to bee stings?
14963	J.D.	I don't know. Why?
14964	Dr. Cox	Oh, it's just that it looks so painful and possibly infected that I must flick it!
14965	J.D.	You know what? Okay? This never would have happened if my Hairmet hadn't gotten stolen at your stupid suck-up fest last night!
14966	J.D.	Now, I took the liberty of writing the recommendation you promised me.
14967	J.D.	All you have to do is sign right below where it says, "He makes me proud to be a doctor," and right above where it says, "P.S. He ain't too hard on the eyes, either!"
14968	Dr. Cox	Tell you what, Newbie: This must be a very...very proud day for ya.
14969	J.D.	You can't make me feel guilty for asking for help. That's just the way the world works, okay? A-and you know what? Most people actually like helping out the people around them.
14970	J.D.	Take Carla, for instance! Don't you think she'd do anything in the world to help out Turk, no matter what the situation?
14971	Carla	Look! He didn't apologize! So just back the hell off, okay!
14972	Carla	He messes up and I'm the one who gets...
14973	J.D.	Still, I don't even believe that you think asking for help makes you look weak; I think you don't do it because you're afraid of putting yourself out there. And that's why you're never gonna get anywhere.
14974	J.D.	Thank you for this!

14976	Elliot	Laverne, did you ever notice that in hospitals, even though you're surrounded by like hundreds of people, it's still so easy to get lost in your own thoughts?
14977	Nurse Roberts	Have you been drinkin'?
14978	Elliot's Thoughts	What's wrong with me? Here I am trying not to let fear ruin my life anymore, and then Sean moves away and I don't even have the guts to tell him how I feel.
14979	J.D.'s Thoughts	...how I feel. I mean, life's too short not to go for it with Elliot. Plus, now Sean's out of the picture? Stop being such a chicken!
14980	Turk's Thoughts	...such a chicken! I know it's a complicated procedure, but I can do it without Carla there! What am I so scared of?
14981	Dr. Cox's Thoughts	...what am I so scared of? That I might actually get this job, and have no one to blame it on if I fail? Good Lord, I'm pathetic! When was the last time...
14982	Carla's thoughts	...when was the last time he ever apologized for anything? I wanna help him, I do, but in a lot of ways I guess I'm as stubborn as he is. I wish I could make some sense out of...

I mean, it'll be hard and we'd be going a long time without sex, but I can totally go that long without sex! Sean, I am a sex camel! Look, the point is I'm not ready for this relationship to end; so, even if you break my heart right now, it's okay, because I'd regret it more if I didn't take this shot. So, what do you say?

14999	J.D.	Nope, nope, nope. The correct answer is: A quarter and a nickel.

15012	Dr. Cox	Would you please help me?
15013	Jordan	So! I think we should make Perry residency director.
15014	Dr. Kelso	You honestly think the board would pick him because you had his love-baby?
15015	Jordan	Oh, I don't know.... Of course, if they don't, I'm gonna bitch and moan about it until these nice gentlemen are dead.
15016	Board Member	All those in favor of Dr. Cox?

15063	Dr. Cox	I've never felt closer to you.
15064	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
15065	J.D.	Well, on the plus side, his temperature's 99.9, so...Sayonara, Mr. Bober!
15066	Dr. Cox	Oh, I could just give you a hug! Of course, I never would! I could, but I never would, God save me! I never would...
15067	J.D.'s Thoughts	Eh, no biggie. 'Cause here comes my dream girl with a smile just for me.
15068	Elliot	J.D.... You know what I love?
15069	J.D.	What?
15070	Elliot	My boyfriend Sean.
15071	J.D.'s Narration	And that's when I made one of the biggest mistakes I've made in some time....
15072	J.D.	I'm really bummed out about Elliot. I just needed someone to talk to.
15073	J.D.'s Narration	I called my brother.
15074	Dan	Yeah, boo-frickin'-hoo. Listen, I'm so glad you called. You know how Mom's getting remarried again for the seventh time? Well, this is turning into such a hassle for me....
15075	J.D.'s Narration	And with that, I had reopened the door that I had successfully closed years ago.
15076	J.D.	Yes, Dan, I got your eleven messages. Now, because you're my brother, I'm gonna put this nicely: Leave me alone.
15077	Dan	This whole Mom thing doesn't bother you?
15078	J.D.	Yes, it's killing me. So much so that I have to go, okay?
15079	Dan	All right, buddy. I'll see you soon.
15080	Dan	Real soon.
15081	J.D.	Wait! Dan! Hoog!
15082	Turk	'Sup, Dan.
15083	Dan	Christopher! Looks like we have the makings of a dog-pile here.
15084	J.D.	Turk, don't.
15085	Turk	Sorry, dude. I gotta!

15087	Elliot	I miss Sean.
15088	Carla	Awww.
15089	Elliot	This long-distance thing is killing me.
15090	Carla	Well, are you having phone-sex?
15091	Elliot	Uhhh, gross!
15092	Carla	Last year, when he went home for the holidays, I gave him a call. You'd be surprised at how much Turk's eleven-year-old nephew sounds like him...and how worldly he is.
15093	Elliot	Yeah, well I'm not comfortable doing it here, anyway. I mean, these walls are so thin, that guy next door listens to every single thing I say.
15094	Elliot	Yeah, I can hear you, there, breathing!
15095	Elliot	You sick bastard!
15096	Carla	Look, you just need to find a place where you're not so self-conscious.
15097	Elliot	Hi, Sweetie. Are you naked? ... Okay, ummm, now imagine me taking off my shirt and kissing down your neck and Can you hear me? Sean? ... Good. Okay, now I'm at your chest and my tongue starts Are you there? ... Good, because now I am licking your nipples all over. ... Your nipples. ... Nipples, Sean! I'm licking your nipples!
15098	Kid	Look, Oliver!
15099	Elliot	I don't care how close you are! I'll call you later!

15101	J.D.	Dude, we have to get my brother out of here he's driving me crazy.
15102	Dan	I did not repeat, did not just drop a toothbrush in the toilet.
15103	Turk	Was it blue?
15104	Dan	Yellow.
15105	Turk	Oh, don't sweat it. So, Mrs. D.'s getting remarried, huh?
15106	Dan	Ugh, yeah!
15107	Dan	To a loser! Total loser. This guy's making me move out of Mom's attic.
15108	J.D.	Oh, the audacity.
15109	Dan	I know. But you know what? This is gonna be great. You know, this reminds me of the time I came down to see you guys when you were in med school.... Oh! And I hooked up with that slutty chick! Remember, the one with the huge cans? What was her name?
15110	J.D.	Amy.
15111	Dan	Yeah! How do you remember stuff like that?
15112	J.D.	She was my girlfriend.
15113	Dan	Right.
15114	J.D.	No.

15116	Dan	Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm........
15117	Turk	Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm........
15118	Dan	Hey! Hey! Check this out! Turk and I have been working on our harmonizing.
15119	Dan	A-one, a-two, a-one, two three:
15120	J.D.	Haunting.
15121	Dan	You've always had the talent, little brother. You get in on this, and we could take this on the road!
15122	J.D.	I love the theatre....
15123	Turk	Ah! Come to papa!
15124	J.D.	Turk! Can you please not put your skivvies in the freezer!? I'm sick of my popsicles tasting like fabric softener!
15125	Turk	I like my bad boys to stay nice and cold.
15126	Dan	Make sure you're nice and dry down there, otherwise you get a tongue-on-the-flagpole situation you don't want that.
15127	Turk	Ahhhhhh!
15128	J.D.	This is a stimulating conversation. I can't imagine why Mom's new husband doesn't want you in the house.
15129	Dan	Me neither! And you know what, J.D.? I'm worried, 'cause I think this marriage might actually stick.
15130	J.D.	They did?
15131	Dan	Oh, yeah, yeah. Matter of fact, the only reason you were born is 'cause Mom bounced a check at the market.
15132	J.D.	Oh, that's great! I I guess you're only here because Mom wrecked the car?
15133	Dan	No, they wanted me.

15135	Turk	Hey! My nephew just asked what you're wearing today. How cute is that?
15136	Carla	Not as cute as you think.
15137	Carla	Hey.
15138	Elliot	Carla.... I've gotta scrape some cash together to see Sean.
15139	Dr. Kelso	Okay, everyone, listen up: It came to my attention that Dr. Brogan here has been moonlighting over at County Medical. Now, if he were to kill someone over there, great; but if he were to make a mistake here because of how tired he was from working at his other job, then my hospital would be liable. So, Ted, why don't you tell everyone what my policy on moonlighting is.
15140	Lawyer	No...moonlighting.
15141	Dr. Kelso	Now, Dr. Brogan will be suspended _without pay_ for one week, but on the plus side, he gets to run around in my backyard wearing a foam suit so I can see if my dog Baxter's attack classes were worth the money!
15142	Doc	Yeah, uh-huh.
15143	Doc 2	Yes, sir.
15144	Turk	Uh-huh.
15145	Carla	Absolutely, sir. Absolutely.
15146	Elliot	No moonlighting, sir!
15147	Elliot	So, where do you guys moonlight?
15148	Female Doc	Insurance physicals.
15149	Male Doc	Free clinic.
15150	Turk	Mammogram-mobile. Well, not officially I just got the offer today but I'd make more money than I do now, riding around in an ambulance, and even though I'll be handling breasts all day, my beautiful fiancee, who is very secure with the will let me
15151	Turk	I ride around in an ambulance.
15152	J.D.'s Narration	Dan wanted to come with me to work today, but I told him it would make me a little uncomfortable. He was okay with it.
15153	Dan	Now, I heard there's a bed in the on-call room. You ever get, uh, hot & heavy in there?
15154	J.D.	Nah, usually I'm in there by myself.
15155	Dan	So, yes.
15156	J.D.	Oh, thank God.
15157	J.D.	Dr. Cox! You remember my brother Dan?
15158	Dan	Whatta ya say, Coxy!
15159	Dr. Cox	Nothing!
15160	Dan	That's a first.
15161	J.D.	This is my boss, Dan.
15162	Dr. Cox	You know what a boss is: For you, that would be the seventeen-year-old that tells you to clean out the grease-trap after you've filled all the ketchups.
15163	Dan	Oh, my ribs!
15164	J.D.	Uh, Dan, why don't you go get a snack cake?
15165	Dan	Snack cake.
15166	J.D.	Uh, Dr. Cox, Dan was wondering if he could trail with us today....
15167	Dr. Cox	Good God in heaven, Newbie, there are just so very many ways for me to say this to you: Never; not in a million years; absolutely not; no way, Jose; no chance, Lance; niet; negatory; mm-mm; nuh-uh; oh-oh; and of course my own personal favorite of all time, man falling off of a cliff "Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!..."
15168	J.D.	Look, Dr. Cox...
15169	Dr. Cox holds up a finger	"Wait for it."
15170	Dr. Cox	..."Pff."
15171	J.D.	I just want to say, thank you.
15172	Dr. Cox	Hold the phone. You don't want him to come with us?
15173	J.D.	"Nooooooooo..." Heh. "Poof." Heh.
15174	Dr. Cox	Dan? Come!
15175	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
15176	Elliot	Thanks a lot, Turk! I didn't get that mammogram-mobile job because they said you took it after all!
15177	Carla	What!?
15178	Turk	Yes, I took it! But, it pays better, and we both know that this job is about helping women detect breast cancer, and nothing more!
15179	Carla	Well, have fun! 'Cause you'll never see "the girls" again!
15180	Carla	Hey, Elliot, the place where I moonlight pays pretty well. I can call them for you.
15181	Elliot	Cool! What's the gig?
15182	Carla	It's great. It's just emergency patch and fix work it's no different than treating a patient at our hospital, okay?
15183	Elliot	Okay.
15184	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
15185	Dr. Cox	Oh-ho! Lookie here! Uh, tell me sir, what is it that brings Dr. Dorian's favorite gomer back to the hospital?
15186	Mr. Bober	Pickles.
15187	Dr. Cox	Fair enough.
15188	Dan	What's a gomer?
15189	J.D.	A gomer's an old person that takes up room in the hospital and doesn't have the common decency to die.
15190	Dan	See, now that's just rude is what that is.
15191	J.D.	Well, I'm sorry, dude, I don't I don't have time for pickles right now. I got three vegetables and a drug addict who's gonna tell me this time things'll be different, then try to take my watch again.
15192	J.D.	Dammit!
15193	Dr. Cox	Not gonna be necessary, seeing as how his temperature is below a hundred. Take him away.
15194	Dan	So, Dr. Cox, how long has my little brother had the desire to smother old people? I feel I should warn Grandma.
15195	Dr. Cox	Gonna sound a little dark, but in all fairness you gotta deal with this place any way you can.
15196	Dan	Dude, these are living, breathing people we're talking about here.
15197	Dr. Cox	I'm s I'm s I'm sorry, I'm sorry, what do you do?
15198	Dan	I tend bar.
15199	Dr. Cox	Well, I'll tell you what, there, Dan: I'm gonna go ahead and worry about how we do things around here. But if I ever do need to find out how to make a top-notch rum and coke, well, by gum, mister, you had better be by the phone, cause I just might give you a jingle.
15200	Dr. Cox	Ba-ha-rrrri-hing! Hi, Dan? Coxaronie. Regarding the rum and coke issue couldn't be more confused!

15202	Carla	Okay, we have another dog coming in. Do you want him or the four cats next door?
15203	Elliot	Oh, I'll go with the dog. I don't know what it is, but all cats hate me. I mean, if I even make eye contact with them, they freak out.
15204	Carla	Okay.
15205	Dr. Kelso	Well, well, well....
15206	Elliot	Agggghhhh! Stupid kitty! Hey! Get off me! Stupid cats!

15209	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
15210	J.D.	Well, Dan, what can I say. It's been, uh, three days....
15211	Dan	Two days.
15212	J.D.	Feels like three. But, uh, say hi to Wayne, and good luck in the bumper pool tournament.
15213	Dan	Yeah, actually, J.D., I don't think I'm leaving.
15214	J.D.	Why!?
15215	Dan	Well, 'cause I'm worried about you. I mean, hanging with you today and watching you work, with the gomer talk and all the attitude now, I'm not so sure I like the guy you're turning into. It's definitely not my little brother.
15216	J.D.	You know what, Dan, once Dad left and Mom started marrying everyone that rang the doorbell, I remember someone saying how lucky I was to have an older brother. But you never came through for me once, did you. I mean, I called you for help because I'm in love with a girl who's in love with someone else, and you responded by showing up here, drinking all my Bailey's Irish Cream, and whining about Mom's new boyfriend. You are a self-involved user, Dan. And you wanna tell _me_ what kind of person to be? I tell you what, instead, why don't you just get the hell out of my life?
15217	Dan	But we're brothers. That counts for something, right?
15218	J.D.	Not to me.
15219	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
15220	J.D.'s Narration	Whenever there's an argument in my family, it's a time-honored tradition to pretend nothing happened.

15223	J.D.	Chocolate chippity good!
15224	Dan	More whipped cream, Christopher?
15225	Turk	Bring it!
15226	Turk	Mmm-ghmmmm!
15227	Dan	I just want to say before I hit the road, it's been great hanging with you; and Johnny, I know I don't say this nearly enough, but, um

15231	Carla	How are we gonna blackmail Kelso?
15232	Elliot	No, no, no, no, no! Unless you take the fall for both of us, I'm telling Turk you're sleeping with someone.
15233	Carla	Relax, Elliot. I have a secret weapon!
15234	Lawyer	You saw nothing!
15235	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
15236	J.D.	Hey, thanks for loaning me this shirt, man. I got a lot of compliments from the sistas. Sharon the security guard even called me a cracka!
15237	Turk	Dude, how many time I gotta tell you? Cracker bad!
15238	J.D.	Turk, you don't get it, man. Your family was there for you.
15239	Turk	You know, I love how kids of divorce really have the market cornered on family dysfunction. But let me share with you a typical Thanksgiving at the Turk household: It starts with my mother yelling at my sister for yelling at my grandmother who's yelling at the television screen, which happens to be the microwave. And then my militant brother Jabari formerly Bob gives my father attitude for using the word "black", even though he's referring to the turkey. Which, by the way, only got burnt because instead of turning the oven off, my bi-polar aunt Leslie tried to shove her head in it.
15240	Turk	Now check the ball, cracka!
15241	J.D.	One-nothing.

15246	Dr. Kelso	Good afternoon, suspendees, Ted.
15247	Dr. Kelso	What a boy!
15248	Lawyer	Sir, about Nurse Espinosa and Dr. Reid's suspensions, really there aren't any grounds to punish them for moonlighting, because they weren't working with people just animals.
15249	Dr. Kelso	"Just animals"? Oh, please, this dog is smarter than most people. He's definitely smarter than _you_.
15250	Lawyer	Sir, I don't think
15251	Dr. Kelso	Baxter, sit!
15252	Dr. Kelso	Ted, sit!
15253	Carla	Ted, you don't have to!

15273	Dan	Yeah.
15274	J.D.	Look, um, Dan...I wanna apologize for everything I said. For what it's worth, I really like having you around.
15275	Dan	No you don't.
15276	J.D.	I know. I have dreams where I staple your fingers to your face.
15277	Dan	That's okay. I'll see you back home at Christmas.

15279	Dr. Kelso	Why are you here.
15280	Elliot	My boyfriend is in New Zealand for six months, and if I don't moonlight, then I'm never gonna have enough money to see him.
15281	Carla	My wedding's costing twice as much as I thought it would, and I need the extra cash.
15282	Lawyer	Baxter won't get out of my chair.
15283	Carla	Dr. Kelso, even though we're understaffed and underpaid, I've been working here for ten years! I mean, all day long? All I hear is "Carla, Carla, Carla, Carla, Carla, Carla, Carla, Carla, Carla, Carla, Carla, Carla, Carla, Carla, Carla, Carla...Carla...Carla."
15284	Elliot	Sir, what wh what Carla is saying, and not in any kind of crazy or, uh, rambling sort of way, is that we work hard here at the hospital, but it's not the only thing in our lives.
15285	Carla	Surely you must know what it's like to love someone so much that you'd do anything you had to.
15286	Dr. Kelso	I'll see you two in the morning. Now get out of my office before I change my mind.
15287	Dr. Kelso	Darling, I wanna say something. For the past 25 years, we've been going through the motions once every couple of weeks we have sex, and then we have breakfast without saying a word. Well, tonight, I want you to put on a nice dress, because I'm gonna take you to dinner and I'm gonna start telling you all the things I haven't taken the time to say all these years. ... I love you, too.
15288	Lawyer	That was...beautiful, sir!
15289	Dr. Kelso	Thanks, Ted. Call my wife, tell her I won't be home tonight.
15290	Dan	Hey, Dr. Cox.
15291	Dr. Cox	Oh, here I'd been told you left. It made me happy.
15292	Dan	Yeah, you don't like me. People don't like me. You know why? I'm a screw-up; always have been. For instance, when we were kids, Mom would always make me walk Johnny to school first day every year. Every year, I'd walk him to the wrong school! Just 'cause!
15293	Dr. Cox	Boy, that's a great story, really. And I'm sure you were just a horrible big brother
15294	Dan	Well...
15295	Dr. Cox	but I'm afraid you have me confused with somebody who gives a crap. And it's okay, you don't need to be embarrassed, turns out it happens all the time. For instance, my father actually made the same mistake on his death bed.
15296	Dan	Hey, listen, Dr. Cox: No offense, I'm a big fan of the tough-guy act, but let me tell you what I really think. I think you love the fact that these kids idolize you. Johnny does! Johnny was always the one in the family we knew was going someplace sweet kid, smart kid. Becoming a doctor, this is all he ever wanted; and yet, somehow, you've found a way to beat that out of him, haven't you? Turned him into some cynical guy who seems to despise what he does.
15297	J.D.'s Narration	Love can give you strength you never knew you had.
15298	Dan	It was good seeing you, Dr. Cox.
15299	Dr. Cox	Good to see you, Dan. All the best.
15300	J.D.'s Narration	Love can also give you courage.
15301	Elliot	Lots of cats today! Heh! What's wrong with this guy?
15302	Carla	I think he's got something stuck behind his big, sharp tooth.
15303	J.D.'s Narration	As for me, it's enough just to love my brother, even though I know he'll never come up big for me.
15304	Dr. Cox	Well, Mr. Pickles, welcome back.
15305	J.D.	Here we go with this guy again.
15306	Dr. Cox	Yep. Still, it sure is nice to be doing something you love. I wouldn't trade it. How 'bout you?
15307	J.D.	No....
15308	Dr. Cox	Don't forget that.
15309	Mr. Bober	Pickles.
15310	Dr. Cox	Damn right, sir. Damn right.

15312	J.D.'s Narration	It's always nice when someone from Carla's family comes to town.... Mostly because she cleans our apartment.
15313	Carla	Why is there a pancake in the silverware drawer?
15314	Turk	You mean, why is there silverware in the _pancake drawer_? Wuhuh!!
15315	Carla	Hey, those nuts are for my brother, please don't eat 'em all!
15316	Turk	Baby, why you makin' such a big deal about your brother coming, anyway?
15317	Carla	He's my baby brother! I practically raised him! Now, I want you to try and get along with him this time? If you do, I promise to fulfill that fantasy of yours but not with the weird outfit, and none of those crazy toys.
15318	Turk	So we'd just have normal sex....
15319	Carla	If I'm not sleepy!
15320	Turk	Deal.
15321	J.D.	What's up with you and her brother, anyway? Did something happen at her mother's funeral?
15322	Turk	Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Just so you know, this is a rental and I got the mileage right up here , so no joy-rides, comprende?
15323	Carla	Turk! This is my brother, Marco!
15324	Turk	Sorry for your loss....
15325	Turk	I mean, who wears a vest to a funeral, anyway, man?

15343	Elliot	Hey.
15344	J.D.	What are you doing?
15345	Elliot	All the beds are taken. Scoot.
15346	J.D.	Bunk with The Todd!
15347	Elliot	J.D., you know that he is a sleep humper.
15348	Todd	Sometimes when I'm banging this mattress, I'm thinking about banging that one!
15349	Elliot	Hello? ... Sean!? Where are you? ... The west coast of New Zealand? I'm in the on-call room! ... Hey, J.D.'s here!
15350	Elliot	J.D., say hi!
15351	J.D.	Oh, hey Sean.
15352	Elliot	Uh!?
15353	J.D.	Oh! You wanted to keep talking?
15354	J.D.'s Thoughts	How are you supposed to get over someone when you have to be around them all the time?
15355	J.D.'s Thoughts	This night could not get any worse.
15356	J.D.	Todd! You're having a dream! Wake up!
15357	Todd	Dude, I _am_ awake.

15359	Jordan	I'm having second thoughts about our giant nanny. She's lovely and all, but every time the fridge is empty, she looks at our son like he's a plate of ribs.
15360	Dr. Cox	Well, you shoulda let me hire the really skinny model. At least if she ate Jack, she'd throw him up right after.
15361	Jordan	I got board meetings all day, but I'll see you for dinner tonight.
15362	Jordan	Bye, wife
15363	Dr. Cox	Rreowr.
15364	Elliot	Doug! Doug!
15365	Doug	I don't wanna be a doctor!
15366	Doctors	Awww.
15367	Dr. Cox	Fine. I'm gonna go ahead and tell you how it ends: Dr. Phil says, "And how...is that working out...for you?" And the big fat lady cries, "Wah."
15368	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
15369	Elliot	Hm!
15370	Dr. Cox	It's all about the four dollars, trust me. And seeing as my money is contingent on you lemmings actually doing your jobs, I would say that now is a pretty good time for you to scurry on back to work so that I can continue to afford the antidepressants that keep me so damn jolly. GO!!!
15371	Dr. Cox	Say, Angela....
15372	J.D.	Oh, I think he means _me_, Angela.
15373	J.D.'s Thoughts	I wonder what I did now.
15374	Dr. Cox	Lookit, this new gig is a great opportunity for me, and I I want it to go well. And, for some reason, all these other bobble-heads seem to look up to you, so it would make my life one hell of a lot easier if you got in line behind me.
15375	J.D.	No problem.
15376	J.D.'s Thoughts	I guess people can surprise you.
15377	Danni	We'd still die.
15378	J.D.	We'd still what?
15379	Danni	If the elevator cable snapped, even if we timed it out perfectly and jumped up right before impact, we'd still be crushed to death. I wish I'd taken the stairs.
15380	J.D.	Me too.
15381	Danni	Sorry, sometimes I just have this inner monologue running through my head.
15382	J.D.'s Thoughts	Inner monologue? Weirdo!
15383	J.D.	That's my floor.
15384	Danni	Lucky bastard.

15392	Elliot	What'd I miss?
15393	Dr. Kelso	It's come to my attention...
15394	J.D.	Something's come to his attention.
15395	Dr. Kelso	...that some family members of our critically ill patients have been complaining because of the relatively small amount of time you all spend with their loved ones. 'Course, in Dr. Murphy's case that's probably a good thing.
15396	Doug	Sir, if I could just take this chance to explain my disturbingly high mortality rate?
15397	Dr. Kelso	Why don't I do that for you? You're a bad doctor.
15398	J.D.'s Narration	Unfortunately, our new residency director felt a little differently.
15399	Dr. Cox	Dead. Dead. Dead. Dead. And, oh my goodness, if we don't have somebody here that we might be able to help. Miss Bartow is thirty-six, she is septic, and she is in respiratory failure. Dr. Weiss, I want you to draw three sets of surveillance cultures. Mr. Murphy
15400	Doug	_Dr._ Murphy?
15401	Dr. Cox	...Just go ahead and get a steady BG.
15402	J.D.	I say we listen to Dr. Cox, and do exactly what he says.
15403	Dr. Cox	That's unbelievable.
15404	Elliot	But, Dr. Cox, earlier today Dr. Kelso was telling us that he wants
15405	Dr. Cox	Ugssshhhhh. I don't ever want to hear anything that's come out of that man's mouth; unless, of course, it's "Oh, my God! I'm dying. Now I'm moving towards the light. But wait a minute, there's been a mistake! This is Hell! Hello, Hitler. Hello, Mussolini. Captain Kangaroo? _That's_ weird!"
15406	Elliot	Dolphin _trainer_ sex. My boyfriend is a dolphin trainer.
15407	Dr. Cox	Here that's a shame, because the whole dolphin thing used to make you so interesting. Too bad.
15408	J.D.	You heard him, people! We're moving on!
15409	Dr. Cox	Oh, God help me.

15415	J.D.	Oh, GOD!
15416	Danni	I don't mind it at the movies, sitting alone. But eating alone is sad and pathetic.
15417	J.D.	Are you stalking me?
15418	Danni	Nooo. My sister just had a baby, so I'm doing the whole aunt thing.
15419	J.D.	So, is there any chance of you guys getting back together?
15420	Danni	Well, he's engaged, and he's getting married in two weeks...but, yeah, I think so.
15421	Danni	Unrequited love sucks, you know.
15422	J.D.	Yeah, it does. You know what we need to do? Uhh...?
15423	Danni	Danni.
15424	J.D.	J.D.
15425	Danni	Hi!
15426	J.D.	Hi. Danni, we need to move on, okay? No more thinking about our exes; no more waiting for the phone to ring; no more stealing her purse just so you can return it later in the hopes that she'll be so grateful, she'll use the money recovered to buy you a drink and _maybe_ have sex with you after.
15427	Danni	Did that work?

15434	Carla	Oh, hey Turk, why don't you play the next game with Marco?
15435	Turk	Baby, I I hate PacMan.
15436	Carla	Really? Because you have bed-sheets that indicate otherwise.

15441	Subtitle	I don't want to be friends with your stupid, melon-headed boyfriend.
15442	Turk	Baby, I don't understand why he just doesn't learn English.
15443	Marco	Ahh, que se queja que no hablo inglés. Él que no se molesta aprender español..¡para la mujer que dice que ama!
15444	Subtitle	I bet he's whining about how I don't speak English even though he's never bothered to learn Spanish.
15445	Carla	Él está aprendiendo, ¿ok? Dice que "sí", dice que "no", dice "queso".
15446	Subtitle	He's trying to learn. He's already got 'yes', 'no', and 'cheese'.
15447	Turk	Hey! Somebody say something about cheese? 'Cause if you gonna make a cheese run, holla at me, dawg!
15448	Carla	Baby, when we left the Dominican Republic, Marco never wanted to learn English. He even went to boarding school in Puerto Rico. Imagine what it's like to constantly feel like an outsider just because you're proud of your heritage.

15453	Dr. Cox	Miss Bartow's systemic vascular resistance is falling, so the next couple hours are gonna be crucial, okay?
15454	Dr. Kelso	Perry, the fact that these residents are spending most of their time buzzing around that one patient makes me think that you told them to disobey a direct order from me.
15455	Dr. Cox	Bob Kelso, that's just not true. Here, I told them to disregard _all_ direct orders from you.
15456	Dr. Kelso	I know you all think of me as some heartless monster; still, if your grandmother were here, wouldn't you want her doctor to spend as much time with her as he does with anyone else?
15457	J.D.	Grandma Dorian or Nana Hobbs? Because Nana Hobbs can be an eensy bit racist.
15458	Dr. Kelso	Grandma Dorian.
15459	J.D.	She's dead.
15460	Dr. Kelso	The point is, sometimes what's best for this hospital _is_ what's best for the patients! I know it, you know it, and guess what, Dr. Cox knows it, too. Although damned if he doesn't disagree with me just because I said it.
15461	J.D.	Sir, I don't think that's true.
15462	Dr. Kelso	Perry! It's hotter than hell in here!
15463	Dr. Cox	Freezing!
15464	Dr. Kelso	Great coffee, though!
15465	Dr. Cox	Rat piss!
15466	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Murphy is an incompetent suck-up.
15467	Dr. Cox	No, Bob. In fact, he's one of the finest young doctors I've ever had the good fortune of working with.
15468	Dr. Kelso	Your witness.

15476	Danni	And I said, "Congratulations on the wedding, and I hope you two stay happy, and, by the way, size does matter."
15477	J.D.	See! That's what happens when you finally have the courage to cut the cord! Before you know it, you'll be ready for someone new to come along.
15478	Danni	Hey, you wanna go grab a cup of coffee?
15479	J.D.	Ooh, I can't. I got something really important to do.
15480	Elliot	Thanks, J.D. I am so tense. Someone stole my purse!

15489	Janitor	Ni empieces.
15490	Subtitle	Don't get me started.
15491	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, if the dynamic does change, it's never as simple as you'd hope.
15492	Dr. Cox	Hey, Newbie, listen, I got dinner plans with Jordan, and seeing as you're on-call, whatta you say you pull up a chair, here, in front of Miss Bartow?
15493	J.D.'s Narration	...Especially when it involves someone who's used to you following their lead.
15494	J.D.	Look, Dr. Cox, I'll take care of her, and I'll have my interns help, but you gotta know I have other patients, too, so....
15495	Dr. Cox	Maybe you didn't understand me, there, Violet. I don't want you leaving her side, even if someone thinks they saw Justin Timberlake downstairs. Now, dammit all, are you falling in line with me or not?

15497	Dr. Cox	Okay, then.

15540	Doug	Hey, _your_ last name is Reid!
15541	Elliot	Doug. I have underwear in my butt. After that, though, I'll totally swing back by here.
15542	Dr. Kelso	You're losing them! Oh, don't get me wrong, you had me worried there was gonna be a bunch of young Dr. Coxes roaming the halls, calling me "Bobbo", shaving my genitals when I pass out at the Christmas party....
15543	Dr. Cox	Tradition is tradition, Bob.
15544	Dr. Kelso	Yeah.... Then I remembered that you've been here over ten years, and there's not a single disciple of yours to be found. And you know why?
15545	Dr. Cox	You told 'em this exact same story and bored 'em to death?
15546	Dr. Kelso	No. It's because eventually they all start questioning the gospel according to Cox, and you can't handle that. Can you?

15552	Carla	Noooooo, not in front of my brother that stuff always makes him uncomfortable.
15553	Turk	Oh, really? I just wanted to apologize for the way I've been acting by loving you up and down, and all around!
15554	Carla	Turk!
15555	Turk	Baby, he can't understand you! Now let's go put some more of your footprints on the ceiling!
15556	Marco	That's it, you son of a bitch!!!
15557	Turk	I told ya!
15558	J.D.	So black people can get black eyes, too, huh? Who knew?
15559	Turk	I haven't had one this bad since your Nana Hobbs threw that rock at me.
15560	J.D.	She thought you were robbing the house.
15561	Elliot	J.D.! Did you hear, Miss Bartow's completely stabilized!
15562	Dr. Cox	I don't wanna see you around here anymore, okay?
15563	Dr. Cox	All right, come on you guys, you all got work to do!
15564	J.D.	Here it comes. I'm incompetent. I'm a girl. I'm a little girl. I'm a little girl with pigtails that rides a tricycle.
15565	Dr. Cox	No. Well...yes, but I am honestly trying to tell you that I don't think I was being clear with you before. In fact, I think I was being a pretty lousy teacher. Look, I think putting one in the "win" column every now and then is what gives us the juice to keep plugging along in games that we know deep down we're not gonna win. And that's why I locked in so intensely to that patient. Because opportunities, they...God, they come along so rarely in this place. And when they do, you just can't let them slip through your fingers. You cannot. You know?
15566	J.D.	I think I do.
15567	J.D.'s Narration	I wasn't sure what I was hoping for. ...That somehow Danni had decided not to leave...that she'd snapped her leg in the parking lot....

15575	Carla	Qué bueno, porque yo nunca tomé la pastilla. Ni la estoy tomando ahora, porque ni he hecho el sexo. ¡Sería divertiduela!
15576	Subtitle	Well, good, because I wasn't on the pill, and I'm not now. I've never had sex. I hope it's fun.
15577	Carla	¿Por qué no me lo dijiste?

15611	J.D.	"Big Al" for example....
15612	Danni	Why don't you just tell me a story? Something romantic.

15623	J.D.'s Narration	...but it got better from there.
15624	J.D.'s Narration	And that night, well...
15625	J.D.	...it was the most amazing night the young doctor ever had.
15626	Danni	And then what happened?
15627	J.D.	And then the young doctor realized he hadn't seen the beautiful girl naked in the light yet.
15628	J.D.	Damn!
15629	Danni	Are you as into this as I am?
15630	J.D.	If I wasn't crazy about ya, would I be willing to do this?
15631	J.D.	Doom-doom, bah, do-doom-doom, dop-bop...
15632	J.D.'s Narration	As I was doing the Naked Chicken Dance that my uncle Bart had taught me, I realized that life couldn't get much better than this.
15633	J.D.	...doom-doom, dop-dop, doom
15634	Dr. Cox	Okay! Now, just because Jordan thinks it's cute that you're violating her little sister doesn't mean that you can use my guest-room for your nerdy, G-rated sexcapades.
15635	J.D.	My bad.
15636	J.D.	It's a beautiful shot of you.
15637	Dr. Cox	Jus Come'ere!
15638	Dr. Cox	Ju you filthy, filthy boy! Filthy girl! Filthy girl!

15644	Jordan	Come on.... It reminds me of my sexiest kiss: Our honeymoon, standing waist-deep in the ocean.... I think you were in at the bar.
15645	Dr. Cox	Okay! Gotta go! Come on.
15646	Danni	Be brilliant today!
15647	J.D.	I always am.
15648	J.D.	Ah! Ow!
15649	J.D.	You know, I hit my head so hard I actually saw cartoon birds. Then I realized I was in Pediatrics and it was just the wallpaper! Ha!
15650	Dr. Cox	Stunning. Look, Tammy, as far as your love life goes, normally I couldn't care less who's laying your quivering body down by the fire while your lips whisper "No, no...no" but your eyes scream, "Yes. Yes. Oh, big daddy, yes!" But when you're dating Jordan's sissy-poo, it forces me to spend time with you outside of the hospital, and I just won't have that. So, hhhere's the deal: Don't want to have dinner with you. Don't want to go bowling with you. And I never, ever again want to walk into my kitchen and hear you say, "Ohh, it's waffle time! It's waffle time! Won't you have some waffles of mine?"
15651	J.D.	"...waffles of mine..."
15652	Dr. Cox	Bottom line: We'll be bestest friends foreverest if you just keep your face out of my face. Uh-huh.
15653	Dr. Cox	Awwww.
15654	J.D.	She's my patient!
15655	Jill	Hey guys, how are you? I'm great! You know me, I'm up, up, up, up, up, and then some fashion nazi on the E! Network says that pear-shaped people shouldn't wear stripes, and whoosh, guess who's ear-deep in mint-chocolate chip ice cream. Meheehee.
15656	J.D.	You know, if you leave it on the counter for an hour, you can just drink it like a milkshake. Except, watch out if that block's not totally melted, hits you in the face!
15657	Jill	Oh, that'd go everywhere.
15658	J.D.	Yeah, one time I got Chunky Monkey in my eye.
15659	Dr. Cox	What brings Ms. Tracy to us?
15660	J.D.	Oh, uh, her landlord found her passed out on her floor.
15661	Jill	Yeah, lucky me, I couldn't pay my rent this month.
15662	J.D.'s Narration	A recent study found that doctors spend an average of fifteen seconds listening to a patient.
15663	J.D.'s Narration	It sounds insensitive, but the truth is it's all the time you need.
15664	Dr. Cox	So, how you feel?
15665	Jill	Awesome!
15666	Dr. Cox	Ms. Tracy...
15667	Jill	Headachy, nauseous, and embarrassed that my landlord saw me in my granny panties.
15668	Dr. Cox	Oh, dear. We're gonna run some tests and figure this out.
15669	Jill	I'll be here! ...If you....

15671	Guy	Ow!
15672	Elliot	Sorry! I if that gets infected, I'm a doctor!
15673	Carla	Look, you keep going to the right, so this time aim at that guy to the left, and you'll hit the board.
15674	J.D.	Those two are like best friends now, huh?
15675	Turk	I know. I wonder what it was that made them so tight?
15676	Carla	Elliot! What are you doing here?
15677	Elliot	I'm, uh, just meeting some friends here for drinks.
15678	Carla	Yes! Me too! Friends.
15679	Erik Estrada	Hey.
15680	Together	PONCH!!!!
15681	Erik Estrada	Damn. I still got it.
15682	Turk	Wait a second, dude, wa that was us.
15683	J.D.	I know.
15684	Together	Greatest night ever!!!
15685	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
15686	Dr. Kelso	Yes, Enid, I hear Baxter growling, but the fact is you ventured into his side of the house. ... Baring his teeth, huh? ... Okay, now here's what you do. ... Are you ready? ... Make a sudden move!
15687	Dr. Kelso	Ahhh, those two!
15688	Lawyer	Sir, we've got some complaints that the new discount stethoscopes you ordered are uncomfortably tight. I contacted the manufacturer, but apparently he's decided to focus more on his hand-made smoking paraphernalia.
15689	Dr. Kelso	Nonsense! These are fine!
15690	Lawyer	Are you okay Dr. Kelso?
15691	Dr. Kelso's Thoughts	Sweet dancing Jehovah! I've punctured my brain!
15692	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
15693	Dr. Cox	Boy, oh boy, that's some rock. When, uh, when's the big day?
15694	Jill	Oh, me? No, no, never my fiancé dumped me. I'm just noticing how beautiful his mother's ring is. You know, compared to the fake one I sent back to him. Oops!
15695	J.D.	Ms. Tracy, we found some organophosphates in your system. Have you had any recent exposure to pesticides?
15696	Jill	Pesticides? No, I don't have any pest problems.
15697	Dr. Cox	Oh, God, that must be so nice!
15698	J.D.	They're just feelings; they'll heal.
15699	Dr. Cox	Don't worry. We're on top of this.
15700	Jill	Oh ...Bye.
15701	Danni	Hey!
15702	Dr. Cox	Hey...hey.
15703	Danni	Jordan just said we should all go to the carnival tonight.
15704	J.D.	The carnival!?
15705	J.D.	Oh, I can't go to the carnival, Danni. I puke at carnivals...a lot.
15706	Danni	You don't really puke at carnivals, do you.
15707	J.D.	I do. But I still love 'em!
15708	Dr. Cox	Look, I have an even dandier idea: Why don't you crazy kids do something on your own?
15709	Danni	Look, Perry, the fact is I'm Jordan's sister, so as long as I'm staying in town you're gonna be seeing a lot of these smiling faces. Smile.
15710	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
15711	Elliot	So, I waxed my legs at home last night.
15712	Carla	Yeah, how did that go?
15713	Elliot	Not great, I can't do it.
15714	Elliot	I'd rather die hairy.
15715	Elliot	Oh, Mrs. Cainings needs something to help her sleep. Give her Haloperidol.
15716	Carla	Haloperidol won't put her to sleep. Give her a Benzo, it'll knock her right out.
15717	Elliot	Yeah, but, sometimes with Benzos older people can have a bad reaction.
15718	Carla	Elliot, have I ever steered you wrong?
15719	Elliot	Who suggested this?
15720	Elliot	Ohhhh! ...Smooth!
15721	Carla	Benzo it is.
15722	Elliot	Hey, wait! What about this one?
15723	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
15724	Todd	Dude, my broccoli is hot.
15725	Turk	Please tell me you mean temperature-wise because there is no way you can find broccoli sexy.
15726	Todd	Oh...yeah...temperature-wise....
15727	Todd	...And mini green boobs-wise! What's up!!
15728	Turk	Sir, I wanted to talk to you about that hernia seminar this weekend?
15729	Turk	Okay, sure, we can totally talk later!
15730	Janitor	Hey, Dr. Kelso. Hey. Dr. Kelso. Uh, I don't know if you heard or not, but Bernice, the lady who does the PA announcements usually, she just got hit by a bus, and, um, I was on the speech team in high school...
15731	Janitor	...so, anyway, I was thinking that maybe from now on, I could do the announcements. You know, just until Bernice gets back on her...foot.
15732	Dr. Kelso	Splendid!
15733	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
15734	J.D.'s Thoughts	Dr. Cox seems to be having fun...but I think I know why.
15735	Dr. Cox	Ohh, ooh! Whack a newbie! Whack a newbie! Whack a newbie! Ohh! Ohhh!
15736	Newbie Heads	Missed me! Ha! Ha!
15737	Dr. Cox	Whack a newbie! Ohh, there you are! Ohh, there you are! Oh, come here! Ohh!
15738	Newbie Heads	Oww! Oww!! Owww!
15739	Dr. Cox	Ohhhhhhhh, whack a newbie!!! Whack a
15740	Jordan	Perry.
15741	Jordan	It's over.
15742	Dr. Cox	Sorry.
15743	Jordan	So, we're gonna go eat some more disgusting fried food and then look at the fat lady to make ourselves feel better.
15744	Danni	So, we'll meet you guys on the Ferris wheel.
15745	Danni	Only if your stomach's okay.
15746	J.D.	Oh, yeah, it's only the back-and-forthy rides that get me.
15747	Dr. Cox	Well, you have done it. It's Friday night, and instead of being at home, drinking whiskey through my son's sippy cup, I'm actually at a carnival with you, surrounded by piles of manure even though I've yet to see a single animal!
15748	J.D.	That __is__ weird....
15749	Dr. Cox	Uh-huh. I'll tell you what, how 'bout we head right on over there, and if you can raise that hammer above your head with those chicken bones you call arms, I'll let you take a free whack at my dome.
15750	J.D.	First of all, I already raised the hammer; and the only reason I didn't ring the bell is that the game is obviously rigged.
15751	Kid	Woo-hoo!
15752	Dad	Good job, son!
15753	Dr. Cox	Uh-huh.
15754	J.D.	Look, the only positive thing about this whole situation is that it's driving you crazy and there's nothing you can do about it.
15755	Kid	Way to go, Gina!
15756	J.D.	Oh, come on!
15757	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
15758	Janitor	Dr. Tushy, you're needed in the OR.
15759	Janitor	Nice name, buddy. Beat up in high school much?
15760	Carla	Oh It's okay. It's okay. It's okay!
15761	Elliot	What's going on!?!
15762	Carla	She's having a reaction to the Benzo.
15763	J.D.'s Narration	There are a lot of different ways to get the upper hand in a relationship.
15764	J.D.	Oh, I gave the guy half a corn-dog so we can all ride foursies!
15765	Dr. Cox	Ohhhhhhohhhhh.
15766	Jordan	Oh, let's go.
15767	Carnie	Corn-dog!
15768	J.D.'s Narration	It can happen with a simple request...
15769	Dr. Kelso	COULD YOU TAKE A LOOK AT MY EARS?
15770	J.D.'s Narration	...it can happen because of a mistake...
15771	Elliot	Mrs. Cainings is stabilized, so DC the posey vest.
15772	Carla	That's never happened to me before with the Benzo. I still think
15773	Elliot	What do you think, Carla? Did you think that maybe I'm the doctor? 'Cause that's what I think. So maybe you should just DC the vest like I asked, and keep your opinion to yourself.
15774	J.D.'s Narration	Still, even when you have the upper hand, it's important to be careful. Because some people fight dirty.
15775	Dr. Cox	You know, Danni, I think it's amazing that you're actually comfortable dating J.D., what with him having nailed Jordan and all.
15776	Carnie	Uh, sorry, folks. A little problem here. Get you down in about an hour or so.
15777	J.D.	I don't feel so good.
15778	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
15779	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes the best thing to do is just to say exactly what's in your heart.
15780	J.D.	I'm sorry I puked on your shoes.
15781	Danni	I'm sorry I wore sandals.
15782	J.D.	And, Danni, that whole thing with Jordan......it's so long ago, I don't even remember it.
15783	Danni	J.D., you keep a sex journal of all your experiences under your bed.
15784	J.D.	Gotta stop showing that to new girlfriends!
15785	Danni	Look, you shoulda told me. But I'm not gonna let things like this mess it up with the guy I'm falling in love with.
15786	J.D.	Oh, thank God! Do you wanna get some pineapple pizza?
15787	Danni	I think I'll probably just go inside and wash my feet.
15788	J.D.	That's robot for "Goodnight."
15789	J.D.	"Peace!" Heh.
15790	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
15791	Turk	All right, people, listen up: Dr. Kelso has ruptured both his eardrums. You could say whatever you want to him as long as you got a smile on your face! HOLLA!

15793	Dr. Kelso	Thanks for the kind words, gang!
15794	Carla	Yes?
15795	Elliot	Carla, look, I just wanted to apologize.
15796	Carla	I'm so glad! I didn't want us to stay mad at each other!
15797	Elliot	It's all my fault! I should never have listened to you in the first place. I mean, I need to be a strong enough doctor to just ignore you when you won't shut up.
15798	Carla	That's so sweet.
15799	Janitor	All available medical personnel, please report to the second floor for a cat fight. Cat fight on the second floor!
15800	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
15801	Dr. Cox	Well, we sent some haz-mat guys over to your apartment, but they said there were no signs of pesticides.
15802	J.D.	They also said you mixed art deco with Indonesian antiques. I think that is so daring!
15803	Jill	Aww.
15804	Dr. Cox	Reel it in, Queer Eye.
15805	Jill	Thanks, guys. Honestly, I can't remember the last time anyone was this nice to me.
15806	J.D.	Well, you know....
15807	J.D.	We gotta go.
15808	J.D.	Hey, you should know your little cheap shot didn't land, because Danni isn't mad at me at all.
15809	J.D.	Hey, Baby! You comin' to give pop-pop some candy? 'Cause I'm hungry!
15810	J.D.	Oh okay, later's fine too.
15811	Dr. Cox	Oh, yeah. I mean, I can I can feel the love all over!
15812	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
15813	Carla	Can you believe that Elliot, giving me all that attitude?
15814	Turk	You know, two weeks ago an O.R. nurse with like twenty years experience started telling me I was tying the wrong suture.
15815	Carla	But I bet you listened to her, right?
15816	Turk	Nah, I kicked her ass out the O.R.! Heh!
15817	Carla	But I bet you were nice about it? Right?
15818	Turk	No, I made her cry. The point is, baby, whatever happens with this patient, it's on my shoulders; and it's the same with Elliot and you know that. That's what makes your relationship so complicated. Outside this hospital, yeah, you're the boss of Elliot...and...well, you know...you're the boss of me and...baby, you're the boss of everyone but in this building, Elliot's in charge.
15819	Carla	Am I really the boss of everybody outside of here?
15820	Turk	Baby, you the boss of everybody in the world.
15821	Turk	Okay.
15822	Janitor	Dr. Dorian, Dr. Turk is free for his rectal exam. He said you'd know what that means.

15824	J.D.'s Narration	Dear Dr. Cox, I think it's important that you know how much I care for Danni, and how hurt I was by your attempt to sabotage our relationship.
15825	Dr. Cox	Oh, de-de-de isn't it enough that I'm reading it!?
15826	J.D.	Oh, I'm sorry.
15827	Jill	Always fun to be in the bathroom listening to people talk so clearly, you're sure they just heard you pee. You did, didn't you.
15828	J.D.	You start and stop a lot.
15829	Dr. Cox	Lovely. Here.
15830	Dr. Cox	Uh, actually there's great news, uh, Ms. Tracy: We're sending you home. Although, I sure wish we could have figured out how that stuff got introduced into your system to begin with. But sometimes in medicine you have to just chalk it up to life's great mysteries, like crop circles or this gal's Adam's apple.
15831	J.D.	I'm a girl, that's original.
15832	Jill	Hey, you guys, I just want to say, if I don't see you again, thanks and take care.
15833	Dr. Cox	You be well, darlin'.
15834	Dr. Cox	I'll see you next time.
15835	J.D.	Wanna hear a great letter?
15836	Jill	No.

15838	J.D.	Hey, everybody. This place has dynamite lamb.
15839	Danni	What are you doing here?
15840	Dr. Cox	I called him. Lookit, after shooting my mouth off the other night I've been feeling a lot of...well....
15841	Jordan	Guilt.
15842	Dr. Cox	No. Not that.
15843	J.D.	Guilt?
15844	Dr. Cox	Yes, that.
15845	Jordan	Ugh.
15846	Dr. Cox	I...I don't like her to be right.
15847	J.D.	Look, Danni, I know you're upset about your sister and I
15848	Danni	J.D., if I didn't go out with the guys my sister slept with, I wouldn't have even had a date to the prom.
15849	J.D.	Then what is it?
15850	Danni	Last night I told you I was falling in love with you. And you know what you said?
15851	J.D.	"Thank you"?
15852	Danni	You asked me if I wanted to go get pizza.
15853	J.D.	No.... _Pineapple_ pizza.
15854	Jordan	Sweetie, you can't take this personally. He's a doctor they don't listen to anyone.
15855	Dr. Cox	Please don't lump us all together with numb-nuts over here.
15856	Jordan	Oh, really? This morning I asked you to do me a favor involving my mother. What was it?
15857	Dr. Cox	Well...I can only hope that it had something to do with hiring people to kill her?
15858	Jordan	Oh, come on. You know what? I hope you guys listen better to your patients.
15859	J.D.'s Narration	And for some reason, right then, we both knew how those pesticides had gotten in our patient's system.
15860	Jill	Lucky for me, I couldn't pay my rent this month.
15861	Dr. Cox	Say, that's some rock. When's the big day?
15862	Jill	Oh, me? No, no, never my fiancé dumped me.
15863	Jill	I honestly can't remember the last time anyone was this nice to me.
15864	Jill	Hey, you guys, I just want to say, if I don't see you again, thanks and take care.
15865	J.D.	She did it to herself.
15866	Dr. Cox	We gotta go.
15867	J.D.'s Narration	I guess the problem with only listening to a patient for fifteen seconds is, sometimes you don't hear everything...and when you finally realize what they were trying to say, you might've lost them forever.
15868	J.D.	Ms. Tracy.
15869	Jill	Hey, guys!
15870	J.D.	We need to talk.
15871	Jill	About what?
15872	Dr. Cox	How _have_ things been going lately?
15873	Jill	Okay? Why, uh
15874	Jill	Ahhh. Actually it has, uh, been a couple of rough months.
15875	Dr. Cox	Come on, Jill. Come on.
15876	J.D.'s Narration	You can never underestimate the importance of listening.
15877	Janitor	A quick note for all my comatose listeners out there: all your lovers have moved on. But, if it's any consolation, my sources tell me they're happy. Well, snooze, you lose. In other news
15878	Dr. Kelso	Get off that thing.
15879	J.D.'s Narration	Listening can effect your career.
15880	Lawyer	There you are, you deaf bastard! I hate you so much, every time you utter my name, I wanna stick my fist all the way down your throat and watch you slowly choke on it!
15881	Dr. Kelso	Ted, I can hear now.
15882	Lawyer	Who's Ted?
15883	J.D.'s Narration	Listening can even mend a friendship.
15884	Elliot	Carla, could you go get You know what, forget it.
15885	Carla	No, doctor, just tell me what you need. I'll do it.
15886	Elliot	Just give him one gram of Ancef for prophylaxis.
15887	J.D.'s Narration	Ultimately, it keeps you in the moment...so you don't miss the things that really matter.
15888	J.D.	So say it again.
15889	Danni	No, you have to earn it.
15890	J.D.	I'll try.
15891	Dr. Cox	Oh, for God's sake, we're watching a movie here.
15892	Jordan	Shh!
15893	Dr. Cox	Kill me.
15894	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
15895	J.D.'s Narration	Relationships can be defined by how long people have been together.
15896	J.D.	I am so late, I don't even have time to eat.
15897	J.D.'s Narration	Whether you've been together for a few weeks...
15898	Danni	Do you wanna have sex?
15899	J.D.	Yes.
15900	J.D.'s Narration	...or together for three years.
15901	Carla	Baby?
15902	Turk	Hm?
15903	Carla	What do you think about getting pregnant right after the wedding?
15904	Turk	See ya!
15905	J.D.	Carla! You can't ask a guy that while he's driving!
15906	Carla	My bad.
15907	J.D.	Yes, it was your bad, Carla.
15908	J.D.'s Narration	...Or whether you've been together for more than five years.
15909	Dr. Cox	Why don't we ever have sex?
15910	Jordan	I find it a little hard to feel sexy seeing as I passed a human being out of my body six months ago.
15911	Dr. Cox	Hey, lookit, I had front seats to that bloodbath, and it hasn't affected my sex drive.
15912	Jordan	Oh, no, no, no, no, I got that when you asked the lactation nurse if she needed help getting things started!
15913	Dr. Cox	Right.
15914	Jordan	You know, Perry, a lot of men would be happy just to have a baby.
15915	Turk	So, you're currently on the pill, right?
15916	Carla	Yes! Will you please, just drop it!
15917	Turk	Okay. 'Cause, you know, you've gotta take it the same time every day.
15918	Turk	Right.
15919	Elliot	When I was in high school, I went to Europe for a month and I forgot to take my birth control pills, so I took like thirty the day I got home.
15920	J.D.	What happened?
15921	Elliot's Mom	Elliot! Your homecoming date is here!
15922	Elliot	Uh.... Stall him!!!
15923	Elliot	Nothing.
15924	Janitor	Oh, Todd, you simply must sample one of these tea buns my mum sent over from Sussex.
15925	Todd	Up high two times. One's for "buns", one's for the "sex" part of Sussex! Come on!
15926	Janitor	Whoa, an American high-five!
15927	Janitor	How perfectly vulgar.
15928	Todd	Yeah.
15929	J.D.	I think the Janitor's pretending to be British.
15930	Doug	You mean Klaus, the German guy?
15931	Janitor	Guten Tag, Doug.
15932	Doug	Thanks!
15933	Janitor	That means "nice haircut."
15934	J.D.	No it doesn't!
15935	Janitor	Mind your own beeswax.
15936	J.D.'s Narration	I guess around here, you have to be prepared for anything.
15937	J.D.	Mmm, Britishy!
15938	J.D.'s Narration	...Especially if you're dealing with a patient who needs emergency surgery.
15939	Turk	Uh, where's Dr. Wen? This patient's ready to go.
15940	Staffer	He just called. He got in a car accident, so he can't make it.
15941	Turk	Don't you play with me, intercom lady! I will find you!
15942	Staffer	Relax. Dr. DiStefano is on-call.
15943	Turk	Thank God.
15944	Turk	We just dodged a bullet because, look, I am nowhere near ready to perform this type of procedure solo. I would have been terrified, you guys would have sensed it, and it would have been a horrible experience for all of us.
15945	Staffer	Dr. DiStefano is stuck in surgery. It's all on you, Dr. Turk.

15949	Turk	Oh, yeah!
15950	J.D.'s Narration	The news of Turk's successful surgery had spread quickly. He was the stud of the hospital.
15951	Turk	Who's the black surgeon you know that just repaired an artery like a pro?
15952	Nurses	Turk!
15953	Turk	That's right, baby.
15954	Ladies	Turk!
15955	Turk	Right on.
15956	J.D.	Turk!
15957	Turk	What?
15958	J.D.	Wow. You must be dancing on the wind right now.
15959	Turk	Dude, today I had to sink or swim all on my own; and guess what? A brother swam.
15960	J.D.	That is so fabulous!
15961	Turk	Dr. Wen!
15962	Turk	I was scared when you didn't show up, but...your car accident turned out to be the best thing that's ever happened to me!
15963	Dr. Wen	My wife broke both her legs.
15964	Turk	Heh. Still.
15965	J.D.	Maybe it's just Buddha's way of telling her to slow down a little, you know?

15970	Dr. Cox	Hey, look, Gandhi, now just because you broke out your little Fisher-Price surgery set and somehow managed to _not_ kill somebody for once, doesn't mean you're queen of the world.
15971	Turk	You think you could do better, old man?

15984	J.D.	So, I've been asking around, and apparently you're known as one of three people: Nigel, the Brit; Klaus, the dim-witted German yes, I said "dim-witted or a simple, good-natured stutterer named Efrem.
15985	Janitor	Who says this is the real me? Perhaps this is? Or this.

15991	J.D.	Excuse me. Dude, she's got a boyfriend.
15992	Guy	Thanks, man.
15993	J.D.	Why didn't you just tell him you were a doctor?
15994	Elliot	I don't know.... I guess I just still don't feel like a doctor, you know? I mean, that whole thing with Turk today really got me thinking. Like, I've ran codes before, but there's always been someone right there ready to bail me out. Like, I've never had that one defining, sink-or-swim moment.
15995	J.D.	Yeah, but I didn't, like, make a big deal out of it.

16005	Dr. Cox	No, I'm serious, Nervous Guy: Get outta here!
16006	Carla	Why won't you admit you hurt your back?
16007	Dr. Cox	Carla, come on! Back injuries are for 80-year-old guys named Norman who have pants up to here, nose-hairs down to here, and who start every sentence with the very elegant .

16018	J.D.	...But you were probably talking to Carla. I'm having such a gay day!
16019	Carla	"Day"?
16020	J.D.	Yeah! It's just this whole janitor thing has thrown me for a loop.
16021	Carla	Danni, we should watch the movie in Turk's room, because he's gonna keep talking about the janitor, even though we begged him not to.
16022	J.D.	I won't, sweetie, trust me.
16023	Danni	Let's go.

16030	Mr. Moran	So tell me something: How did an old geezer like me end up with the prettiest young doctor in the place?
16031	Elliot	It's actually just a simple rotation system based on when your shift started and the last patient that you've seen
16032	Mr. Moran	Sweetheart, I'm just paying you a compliment.
16033	Elliot	I have to go.
16034	Elliot	Thanks for saying I'm pretty.
16035	Dr. Cox	Mm. Oh, yeah. Oh, hello...sweet...oh, sweet couch.
16036	Jordan	I've been thinking about what you said this morning. And you're right, we have not been having enough sex lately.
16037	Dr. Cox	Turns out yes, yes we have.
16038	Jordan	No, we haven't. And tonight, we're gonna do it the way you always fantasized about.
16039	Dr. Cox	Laying down in a big tub of ice?
16040	Jordan	Standing up, against the wall, you holding me up. What do you say, Romeo?

16043	Jordan	Mmmmm.
16044	Dr. Cox	Arggghhh! Oh, yeah! Ohhhh, yeah!
16045	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes the moment comes when you feel like you've been waiting for it your whole life. You just have to hope that no one beats you in there and steals your thunder.

16057	J.D.	It's from 'Shaft'? Come on, how could you guys not get that?
16058	Family Member	Yeah.... That's our 'Citizen Kane'.... Anyway, thanks again. You're a real hero.
16059	J.D.	Oh, please, I put my pants on one leg at a time, just like you guys.

16066	Dr. Cox	I guess I just love you so...much...?
16067	J.D.	What is wrong with you? Is this because I called you "Smelliot"? Because I can't believe you haven't heard that before.
16068	Elliot	J.D., I don't care if you call me that.
16069	J.D.	Hey, everybody! She's cool with "Smelliot"!

16082	Turk	You know, that's not actually a bad idea? We can call it The Naked Rule; and it should probably apply retroactively, so, um, you can get yourself to the airport next weekend?
16083	Carla	Fine.
16084	Turk	Gotta love The Naked Rule!
16085	Dr. Cox	Say, Carla...boy, you...you look nice.

I mean, if I had a dollar for every time I got depressed and my dad didn't make me feel better Actually, he _did_ give me a dollar every time I got depressed. By the end of junior high, I already had a hundred and seventy bucks.... And then got mugged and lost it all. But, by the end of that night, of course, I was back up to a dollar.

16115	Carla	Is that the patch of hair that goes from your belly button down to your pe
16116	Dr. Cox	It is, indeed.
16117	Carla	So? You have a gray happy trail! A lot of women find it distinguished.
16118	Dr. Cox	Carla, I have a six-month-old child. I'm gonna be one of those weird old guys who brings my son down to the park, where everybody is like, Hmm, is he the dad? Is he the grand-dad? Is he the grand-dad's grand-dad? And, oh, my God! Why is he pushing a traffic cone on the swing while his five-year-old little boy is in the mud crying? Is is he taunting the little boy? No! He can't even see the little boy! And, now look, he's actually taking the traffic cone, putting it in the mini-van, and driving away while the little boy cries and the traffic cone sits quietly and watches 'Finding Nemo' on DVD.

Because it would mean you used to be a guy who had dreams and ambitions; and even though things didn't work out the way you'd hoped, at least it would explain why you are the way you are and...make you human. But instead, it turns out you're nothing more than a...a jerk who just likes to mess with people for no reason.

16221	Carla	Listen, I run back and forth for 18 hours a day between patients who _might_ die and patients who _will_ die, and if I find time to write an order for bedpans, I write it fast. So you will forgive me if I don't feel like being judged by some guy in his thirties who still wears shorts to work!

16233	Dr. Cox	Uh, Mr. Randolph, your PSA number's* gone up quite a bit since your last blood test. Now, this could be from the prostatitis*, we won't know for sure until your biopsy results come back later on this afternoon. But I feel pretty certain that we're gonna find something.

16241	Carla	This guy's sick.
16242	J.D.	Thanks.
16243	Janitor	You're stupid!
16244	J.D.	See, now you're just embarrassing yourself. Pick someone else to annoy!
16245	Janitor	I don't pick 'em. They pick me!
16246	Janitor	You know, loose debris can get sucked up into the air conditioning vents. And when that happens, I have to spend the entire day crawling around inside the wall, and I don't like that. You know why? 'Cause there's not enough air. I've hallucinated. I spent a day inside that wall thinking I was a mermaid. So here's the thing: you don't throw around loose trash, and I won't have to waste an entire workday granting the wishes of imaginary fisherman. 'Kay?
16247	Turk	Dude, I'm not scared of you. Life's too good. I'm untouchable.
16248	Janitor	That's what I hoped you'd say.
16249	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Murphy, how about you start us off by describing the medical condition of your patient Mr. Eronson here.
16250	Doug	He's got hypertrophic cardiomyopathy* with severe secondary pulmonary hypertension.*
16251	Dr. Kelso	Wrong. He's dead. Another one bites the dust, huh, sport? Next contestant, Dr. Reid.
16252	Elliot	Mr. Murdock was admitted with a COPD exacerbation*; he responded well to antibiotics and bronchial dilators* but he did develop a rash on his, um......private area.
16253	Dr. Kelso	Sorry, on his what?
16254	Elliot	His peepers.
16255	Dr. Kelso	Excuse me?
16256	Elliot	His schwing-schwong.
16257	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Reid, it's bad enough you run out on a patient in the middle of a pelvic exam. But you are a doctor, and you need to be able to say simple clinical words like "penis," or "vagina," or "anal."
16258	Elliot	"Anal" is not a dirty word, sir.
16259	Dr. Kelso	Tell that to my wife.
16260	Dr. Cox	The, uh, the biopsy's back and I'm afraid it's positive for prostate cancer.
16261	Randolph	Rats! Excuse my language, dear. You know what, Catherine, I can see this conversation being riddled with that kind of talk. Perhaps you should wait out in the hallway.
16262	J.D.	Uh, you know sir, I know that it's cancer, but I'm not really worried.
16263	Randolph	Excuse me, am I confusing cancer with some other disease?
16264	Dr. Cox	No you're not. I think what Captain Bedside here
16265	J.D.	Ow!
16266	Dr. Cox	is _trying_ to say is that it hasn't spread to the lymph nodes yet, so it's still quite easily operable.
16267	J.D.	Yes, and there's an opening in surgery tonight, I managed to jam you in. Look, I know this is happening awfully fast, you must have a lot of emotions swirling around, but I want you to know if you have any questions at all, I'm here.
16268	Randolph	Do you know what channel that Queer Guy show is on?
16269	Dr. Cox	It's okay, tell him.
16270	J.D.	Bravo, Tuesdays at 10, 9 central, 8 Mountain.
16271	Dr. Cox	Oh, lookathat, message from Jordan.
16272	J.D.	How's it going?
16273	Dr. Cox	Just great.
16274	Guy	Hey, watch it!
16275	J.D.	Dr. Cox, we've known each other for over two years.... Let me in, okay? Help me help you. Help me help you, help me help you
16276	Dr. Cox	Stop it.
16277	J.D.	-Help me, help you-
16278	Dr. Cox	Fine, Newbie! Let me let me tell you a little story. It starts every day at 5 in the morning which is just about the time that you're setting your hair for work when I am awakened by a sound: Is that a cat being gutted by a fishing knife? Nooo! That's my son. He's hungry and he's got a load in his pants so big that I'm actually considering hiring a stable boy. But, I go ahead and dig in; because I do love the lad and, well gosh, you know me, I'm a giver. And I'm off to the hospital, where my cup runneth over with both quality colleagues, such as yourself, and a proverbial clown-car full of sick people. But, what the hey, my pay is about the same as guys who break rocks with other rocks and I only have to work three or four hundred hours a week, so, so far I'm a pretty happy camper! And then I head back home where I'm greeted by the faint musk of baby vomit in a house that used to smell like, well...nothing! Nothing! Nothing! I-i-in fact it used to smell like nothing at all. And all I want to do before I restart this whole glorious cycle is, you know, maybe lay on the couch and have a beer and watch some SportsCenter and, if I'm not too sweaty from the day's labors, stick my hand right down my pants, buuut apparently that's not in Jordan's definition of "pulling your weight".
16279	J.D.	Well, that's easy! Just tell her about it. Tell her everything you feel.
16280	Dr. Cox	Should I give her every reason to accept that I'm for real?
16281	J.D.	First of all, no one understands relationships like Billy Joel, okay? "Uptown Girl" got me through high school long story for another day. Secondly, you don't want to end up like the Randolphs back there, just not saying a word to each other, do you?
16282	J.D.	You wish _we_ were more like the Randolphs, don't you?
16283	Dr. Cox	God save me, I do. I reeeeally do!
16284	Turk	Rawwh! Come here.
16285	Carla	So, here's your surprise: You know we'll be getting married in six months.... And I just thought it would be so......hot...
16286	Turk	Yeah?
16287	Carla	...if we didn't have sex again until our wedding night.
16288	Carla	Can you imagine how great that night will be?
16289	Turk	Awww-So great! Um, how about this, though: How about...you stop having sex, but I keep having sex?
16290	Carla	You mean like an affair?
16291	Turk	No! I'll just have sex with you when you're sleeping.
16292	Carla	Turk, how can you not think this idea is so romantic?
16293	Turk	Maybe you got me confused with that little Amish boy you used to date.
16294	Janitor	Untouchable, eh?
16295	Doug is sitting at a table, eating his lunch. The clock indicates it's 4	5. Dr. Kelso is walking past the table.
16296	Doug	Hey, Dr. Kelso, none of my patients have died today.
16297	Dr. Kelso	Really? Mr. Ferguson's corpse begs to differ.
16298	Doug	Darn it!
16299	Dr. Kelso	Oh, and Dr. Reid, your patient, Mrs. Burke, has developed a urinary infection. Apparently it hurts when she makes wizzie-winkles through her sea-biscuit.
16300	Elliot	You know, it's not my fault that dirty stuff makes me uncomfortable.
16301	J.D.	Oh, who's fault is it?
16302	Elliot's Mom	But more important than anything, more important than never letting yourself get fat, is never let a man put his dirty howdoyoudo into your bajingo.
16303	Elliot's Mom	Jorge! I need to see you in the potting shed.
16304	Elliot	She was always yelling at Jorge in that potting shed. But she never fired him. Even after he kidnapped her and took her to Acapulco....
16305	J.D.'s Thoughts	This is a job for Miss Busybody Smartypants!
16306	Carla	I know what you have to do, and I'm gonna help you through this.
16307	Turk	Dude, I'm dying here.
16308	J.D.	Turk, it's been like eighteen hours since you had sex.
16309	Turk	I'm saying, this is torture!
16310	J.D.	So why don't you just, like, "take care of yo'self"?
16311	Turk	Man, you know I don't do that.
16312	J.D.	You don't?
16313	Turk	Nah, I only did that like twice in my life.
16314	J.D.	Same here.
16315	J.D.'s Thoughts	If by "in my life" you mean "since I got home".
16316	J.D.'s Thoughts	If by "in my life" you mean "since dinner".
16317	J.D.	I gotta go to sleep, I'm tired.
16318	Dr. Cox	Ohhhhh, my little newbie-doobie-doo! Say, that whole "telling Jordan how I feel" thing just went terrific, thank you for that. Now I need a place to crash. Where's Naomi's bedroom? Good night, roomies.
16319	J.D.	We gotta get that lock fixed.
16320	Turk	The only lock I gotta get fixed is the one connected to Carla's panties. I need to get a key. I need to call a locksmith. I thought I was the locksmith, man.
16321	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16322	Turk	Then she cut me off, man, just like that. Full prison lock-down, no one gets in or out.
16323	Dr. Cox	Man, that's tough.
16324	J.D.	If you're not gonna use my bed, can I use it?
16325	Dr. Cox	No you may not, on account of this whole Jordan situation being your fault.
16326	J.D.	You told her that spending the day with the baby isn't really a job and that it's turned her into an inflexible shrew!
16327	Dr. Cox	Newbie, you told me to tell her exactly how I feel, I did just that. Now you'll remain on the floor until you come up with a new plan for me.
16328	J.D.	You know, Dr. Cox, I I know this is tough on you what with you being psychotic and all, but, I'm out, okay? It's 3 a.m. and there's nothing in the world that's gonna keep me from going to sleep right now.
16329	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16330	J.D.	What do you mean you changed your mind about surgery?
16331	Randolph	Catherine downloaded some information on alternative treatments diet, exercise, seed implants....
16332	J.D.	No, sir, those are, at best, a stall. Now I know there's trepidation when you talk about surgery in the area of the penis
16333	Randolph	Whoa! Quick pause on the guttertalk! Catherine, hallway.
16334	J.D.	Look, I
16335	Randolph	Go.
16336	J.D.	I know there are possible side-effects, but the incontinence goes away with most patients, and sexual dysfunction can be treated with anything from Viagra to a penis pump.
16337	Randolph	Penis pump? That sounds awkward.
16338	J.D.	Doesn't have to be.
16339	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16340	Randolph	Wow! It's a giraffe!
16341	Randolph	End of discussion! I'm not having the surgery. Although I don't mind that they've shaved me already. Proportionately, everything seems much...grander.
16342	Carla	All right, Elliot, you just have to ease into it, okay? Let's forget about patients for now and start with this.
16343	Elliot	Ohh, my God! She's got a tattoo of a teardrop on her bajingo! Is it sad?
16344	Carla	Her _vagina_, Elliot, she has a tattoo on her beautiful vagina.
16345	Turk	Awwwh! This just isn't fair. Not fair at all. It's ridiculous!
16346	Elliot	This is stupid!
16347	Carla	Elliot, I'm just trying to help.
16348	Elliot	Yeah, you know what Carla, I don't remember asking for your help, okay?
16349	Carla	It does look a little sad. They always do.
16350	Janitor	Hey!
16351	Turk	This is a hospital, why are you playing that song?
16352	Janitor	Ohh! You mean "We Don't Have To Take Our Clothes Off" Jermaine Stewart's classic anthem to platonic love. No reason.
16353	Turk	Whatever it is you're trying to do, it's not working.
16354	Janitor	'Course not, not with you. You're, uh...what'd you say? Untouchable. Well, anyway, back to work.
16355	Janitor	New friend!
16356	Elliot	Mr. Greenberg needs 2.4 milliunits of penicillin IM.
16357	Carla	Why, does he have a spinkle in his gherkin?
16358	Elliot	Carla, you're right, okay? That stuff makes me uncomfortable, and there was a time when that would've sent me into a shame spiral, but now I'm just gonna get over it at my own pace. And until then, I honestly don't mind that you're making fun of me, but what does bother me is that no one is ever allowed to make fun of you.
16359	Carla	People can make fun of me.
16360	Elliot	Come on! What about that delivery guy yesterday? I mean, you practically tore him a new binglebore.
16361	Carla	But he's not my friend. My friends can make fun of me whenever they want.
16362	Elliot	Really? Well, then, in that case you're a know-it-all smartypants and if you're not telling someone what to do, you're probably not talking.
16363	Carla	Okay, I guess I can be a little bossy.
16364	Nurse Roberts	A little? Girl, please! If you met Jesus hisself, you'd be trying to tell him where to park his donkey.
16365	J.D.	Oh, are we allowed to do this now? What about that whole, like, hands on the hips, "Carla from the block" thing she does when she's mad when she's like "Oh, Bambi, you do _not_ want to mess me with right now."
16366	Doug	You do sound like that.
16367	Carla	Careful Doug, we are not that close yet.
16368	J.D.	"Careful, Doug."
16369	Elliot	That's what's up. Mm-mm. Mmm.
16370	J.D.	"Doug, you better be careful, 'cause I'm Carla."
16371	J.D.	Mr. Randolph.
16372	Randolph	What's he doing here? You know I don't like these people.
16373	Randolph	Surgeons. Not African-Americans.
16374	Turk	Oh!... We're actually saying "black" now, sir.
16375	Randolph	I was right, Catherine!
16376	J.D.	Listen sir, I brought Dr. Turk here to help you get over your fear of surgery.
16377	Randolph	I'm not scared.
16378	J.D.	Then what is it?
16379	Randolph	I don't know if you've noticed, but Catherine and I don't always communicate that well.
16380	Turk	No, I can't
16381	J.D.	You're joshing!
16382	Randolph	No, it's true. But when I lay that beautiful woman down onto our bed to make love
16383	Turk	Wow.
16384	J.D.	Oh, God.
16385	Randolph	the walls come tumbling down. It's the one place that I can tell her how wonderful and beautiful she is, and how I would be lost without her. Now I know I will probably have to have this surgery eventually, but until then I am not going to risk losing the one thing that keeps me close to her. Not until I absolutely have to.
16386	Randolph	Yes dear, you can come in.
16387	J.D.'s Narration	Maybe the dirty little secret about sex is that it isn't so dirty after all.
16388	Jordan	Do you think you could try to be a tiny bit mature?
16389	Dr. Cox	Oh, this is me mature. La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!
16390	J.D.	Uh, excuse me.
16391	Dr. Cox & Jordan	Whaaat?!
16392	J.D.	Okay, so there's that.... Uh, look, I realize I let you down before, and I was thinking I could make it up to you by, you know, maybe baby-sitting sometime.
16393	J.D.'s Narration	The weird thing is, even though it's natural, sex can make us uncomfortable.
16394	Elliot	You have a...penis. And I......have a vagina!
16395	Sean	That is so hot.
16396	J.D.'s Narration	But if we work at it, we can get beyond that discomfort.
16397	J.D.'s Narration	And realize that sex can actually be a comfort.
16398	Turk	Hey, baby. I was just with a patient who made me understand what romance really means. So as far as this no-sex thing goes, I'm with you a hundred percent.
16399	Carla	Everyone I know just spent the last two hours listing my faults. I wanna have sex. Now.
16400	Turk	I'll get the condoms.
16401	Turk	Sorry.
16402	J.D.'s Narration	Sex can even be a cure.
16403	Dr. Cox	Whoa, that was.... Well, why were you so angry at me?
16404	Jordan	Oh, I don't even remember.
16405	J.D.'s Narration	How do I know all this? Because no one understands how important sex is better than someone who isn't having any.
16406	J.D.	Helloooo, Cinemax.
16407	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16408	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16409	J.D.'s Narration	At Sacred Heart, there are certain things you can always count on. Dr. Kelso will systematically break Ted's spirit...
16410	Dr. Kelso	Oh, Ted. I meant to tell you eight months ago, all those days of vacation you saved up expire riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight...now!
16411	Lawyer	But sir! I was going to visit The Alamo with the guys from my public sp ...speaking class!
16412	J.D.'s Narration	...Turk will start a fight with Carla that he'll inevitably lose...
16413	Turk	I don't understand it. This wedding is supposed to be about us how come I can't be comfortable?
16414	Carla	And I don't know how many times I have to tell you that you are not wearing sweats!
16415	Turk	All right, fine! I don't have to wear sweats, I'll wear the slacks! But you know what? I'm also wearing the cape, and we gonna have a wind machine, and I'ma be standing on the altar like, "I DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"
16416	Carla	I'm marrying this! This is gonna be my husband!
16417	Turk	Holler!
16418	J.D.'s Narration	...Sean and Elliot will do whatever they can to keep their long-distance relationship going...
16419	Elliot	I love the new camera phone you got us. ... Really?
16420	Elliot	Did you get it? ... No?
16421	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16422	J.D.'s Narration	...And the janitor will think of new ways to torture me.
16423	Janitor	Hey. Don't open your locker for the next couple of days.
16424	J.D.	Why?
16425	J.D.'s Narration	Still, all you need to break the pattern is for something shocking to happen. Like, say, Dr. Cox being in a good mood.
16426	Dr. Cox	You know, Kyle, after three long years of watching you climb that transplant list, I finally have a liver with your name on it.
16427	Dr. Cox	Check Mr. Iverson into Sacred Heart for the last time, will ya?
16428	J.D.'s Narration	You see, when Dr. Cox is in a good mood, well, it flows out of him like a cool breeze that lifts the spirits of everyone it touches.
16429	Dr. Cox	Ohhh, it's gon'ta be a great day-hey-hey-hey-hey-hey-hey-heyyy....!
16430	Lawyer	Not today! Life's too good!
16431	Dr. Kelso	Chicken.
16432	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16433	Carla	Come on, Turk! I got two minutes left on my break, how long is this surgery gonna take?
16434	Dr. Cox	Carla, cut the guy some slack. Surgery is not as easy as it looks. I mean, he's gotta make the incision, cut the wrong artery, panic, collapse into a ball of tears in the corner, and after all that he's gotta go wash up, check the board, and find out who he'll be killing after lunch. It's...a grind.
16435	Carla	You know, you're always taking shots at Turk, but you've never really told me what you think of him as a person.
16436	Dr. Cox	Me-me-me-me, me-me-me-me-meeee. Ah, there's the right pitch. Um, I think that
16437	Carla	Oh, hold that thought.
16438	Turk	I would _love_ to hear what you have to say.
16439	Dr. Cox	I don't think so, there, bowling ball.
16440	Turk	Well, you might as well spill it Carla tells me everything. Except, of course, about that curling iron you have in your locker. It slipped!
16441	Turk	It's back!
16442	Dr. Cox	I can totally do this.
16443	Turk	Wha-at?
16444	Dr. Cox	I think that your fiancé is a self-involved, bobble-headed jock itch who is not good enough for you. Not now, not ever.
16445	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16446	Elliot	Carla, if your wedding ceremony's gonna be in Spanish, then how will I know that you're officially married?
16447	Carla	Because all my cousins will throw tortillas in the air and fire their guns.
16448	Elliot	Really?
16449	Elliot	God, I wish I was ethnic!
16450	J.D.'s Narration	It's always hard to work with terminally ill patients.
16451	Carla	Ted's helping Maggie with her will.
16452	Maggie	Thanks again, Ted. How'd you get through sixty pages so quickly?
16453	Lawyer	Well, Miss Hibersol, it helps to not really know what you're doing.
16454	Maggie	Stop it, Ted. You're a great lawyer.
16455	Lawyer	Ohh, I love her.
16456	Elliot	Maggie, you seem so at peace with everything.
16457	Maggie	There's really only one thing I'll regret.... I'm thirty-eight years old and I'm a virgin.
16458	Elliot	Me too.
16459	Carla	Elliot!
16460	Elliot	Sorry, sorry. It's just a reflex from college when I used to play the tambourine in a Christian rock band. Which was bull because everyone was sleeping with everyone. Sorry.
16461	Maggie	That's okay. I guess I was just waiting for someone special, and now I feel like I've missed out on one of the fundamental experiences of life for no good reason, you know?
16462	Carla	Is there anything we can do?
16463	Maggie	Don't people sometimes pay for sex?
16464	Elliot	Oh, boy, do they. I slept with Jenny Johnson's older brother in high school, and then he decided to tell all of his friends what my orgasm face looked like. Then three of them posed like that for their yearbook photos! Paid for that one for years.
16465	Carla	Elliot, I think she means pay _money_ for sex.
16466	Elliot	Oh, I got a story about that, too not about me, though, my mom.... She gets lonely.

16471	Danni	I'm sorry, I'm just a little preoccupied. I accidentally walked in on my sister and Perry this morning. Can you imagine?
16472	Dr. Cox	Relax, Newbie, the gimp is chained up.
16473	Jordan	Be careful, though, Randall got loose.
16474	J.D.	Who?
16475	J.D.	Owwwwwwwwwwww! ...Why?
16476	J.D.	Powerful tiny fists....
16477	Danni	I gotta get out of there. You think maybe I could crash at your house?
16478	J.D.	Sure. Just bring your own toilet paper. It's...kind of a little rule we have with our guests.
16479	J.D.	Preferably something two-ply!
16480	Turk	How's it going, Danni?
16481	Danni	Great. I'm crashing at your place tonight.
16482	Turk	Oh, cool.... Bring toilet paper.
16483	J.D.	I already told her.
16484	Turk	How'd you get Dr. Cox to like you?
16485	J.D.	Dr. Cox said he liked me!?
16486	Turk	No, you're missing the point
16487	J.D.	I need to know three things immediately: Where was he when he said it, what inflection did he use, and had he been drinking? You know what, I don't care about the third one; sometimes when you've been drinking you're the most truthful.
16488	Turk	Okay, look, I know Carla's gonna have her little pre-wedding panic attack, and what if she has her good ol' buddy Dr. Cox there to tell her what a jackass I am, huh? Then what?
16489	J.D.	You know what? I'm glad he was drunk.

16496	Turk	Dr. Cox, you got it all wrong, man! I don't disdain you! It's quite the opposite I "dain" you. Yeah. I think if you get to know me better, you just might "dain" me, too.
16497	Dr. Cox	Here that's interesting. Of course, it's gibberish, but it's it's interesting nonetheless. I'm gonna go ahead and pass, and here's why: You're a typical surgeon, and as a rule you guys are insensitive and egotistical and you have the sense of humor of about a fourth grader.
16498	Turk	That's just not true.

16502	J.D.	Well, your kidneys healed up enough to release you, but no sparring in karate class for two months.
16503	Randall	Two months!? That's a real punch in the crotch!
16504	J.D.	Randall, could you stop using that expression? Because I can't get it out of my head.
16505	Dr. Kelso	Ladies, explain to me why you are so concerned with my policy on patients having sex in the hospital.
16506	Carla	No reason!
16507	Elliot	Just curious!
16508	Carla	Trying to learn.
16509	Elliot	I love you...sir.
16510	Dr. Kelso	Well, why don't we make it the same as my sex policy with my wife: Absolutely not! Now make me a sandwich.
16511	Mr. Iverson	So, you and Jordan had a kid.
16512	Dr. Cox	Parenthood's pretty amazing.
16513	Dr. Cox	Tell you what, you're all set. Some peon from surgery's gonna come down here and do your pre-op and then you're good to go.
16514	Turk	Room service. Who ordered the liver?
16515	Dr. Cox	Jackass!
16516	Turk	Bite me. Great guy!
16517	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16518	J.D.	Hey, Laverne, my girlfriend's coming by; would you mind giving her the keys to my apartment?
16519	Nurse Roberts	You know, I shacked up with a man before I was married, too. His name was Jesus.
16520	Elliot	Our generation has the exact same morals and values as yours.
16521	Carla	Come on, Elliot. Let's go find ourselves a man-whore!
16522	Elliot	See ya!
16523	J.D.	You know, but she's not moving in permanently. She's just crashing for a while.
16524	Nurse Roberts	Mm-hmm.
16525	Dr. Cox	About a year ago, Jordan said she wanted to "crash for a while." Now my office is a nursery, my closet is my office, my clothes are in the entertainment center, and my TV is in the john, which I guess is kind of nice...I don't even know anymore.
16526	Lawyer	Same thing happened to me. After my divorce, I told Mariana I was going to crash at her place for a few weeks, and we've been sharing a bed for eight years.
16527	J.D.	Isn't Mariana your mother?
16528	Lawyer	Hey, who are we talking about here, you or me?
16529	Dr. Cox	Lookit, here's the rule, there, porn-star: The moment her toothbrush hits your sink, you've got yourself a permanent roomie.
16530	J.D.	How long will you be staying?
16531	Danni	For a while.
16532	Danni	Mmmmm, downy soft.
16533	J.D.	There'll be toilet paper everywhere!
16534	Dr. Cox	Hey, uh...real sorry about the whole mom situation, there.
16535	Lawyer	She has cold toes.
16536	Dr. Cox	Aw, Ted, don't be that guy!
16537	Lawyer	What guy?
16538	Lawyer	What guy?
16539	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16540	Elliot	This is so exciting!
16541	Carla	Wow! Was he a Blood or a Crip?
16542	Elliot	He was Lutheran.
16543	Carla	This is it! This is it! Stop the car.
16544	Carla	Stop the car. Keep the meter running, we'll be right back.
16545	Elliot	Ha! What a rush! I mean, I have never slept with a prostitute before, but if it is half as much fun as buying one, sign me up!
16546	Cop	Hey! Quiet down back there!
16547	Elliot	Sorry. Heh.
16548	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16549	Turk	Now, even though I won't be performing the transplant, I am a key member of the surgical team. It's too complicated to explain what it is I do, but in layman's terms I...I guess you'd call it "watching."
16550	Mr. Iverson	Could you excuse me one second?
16551	Turk	Sure.
16552	Dr. Cox	I taught him that! Well struck, Barry.
16553	Turk	Heh. Heh. Let's let's finish up here, okay?
16554	Mr. Iverson	No, sir.
16555	Turk	Drinking?
16556	Mr. Iverson	Nope.
16557	Mr. Iverson	Oh. I had a couple of glasses of champagne at my daughter's wedding last month. But a little champagne's no big deal, huh?
16558	Dr. Cox	Naaahhhh...hahahaha......ah?
16559	Dr. Cox	Look. Barry...Barry's a...he's a great guy.
16560	Turk	Yeah. I totally forgot the rule to the transplant list is no drinking...unless Cox says you're a great guy.
16561	Dr. Cox	Come on, pally, guy's been on the transplant list for three stinkin' years this is a no-brainer.
16562	Turk	You're right. He's out.
16563	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16564	Dr. Kelso	See, this is why you shouldn't get emotionally invested in your patients.
16565	Dr. Cox	Hey, Bobbo, now when the dark prince does finally call you home, please promise me that you'll donate your body to science. And I don't mean medical science, I mean NASA. Because when those buzz-cuts have all but given up on trying to figure out just exactly what a black hole is, and they get one look at that space where your heart was supposed to be, well by-gum, you know they're just gonna say, "Awwww, shucks! That's what it is!"
16566	Dr. Kelso	Hey, champ! What has two thumbs and doesn't give a crap? Bob Kelso. How ya doin'.
16567	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16568	J.D.'s Thoughts	All right, you're just gonna have to tell her she can't move in. It's no big deal, it's not like she has the keys yet.
16569	J.D.'s Thoughts	AAAAAAAGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
16570	J.D.'s Thoughts	God, I'm horrible at giving bad news! Wait a sec, I'm a doctor, I give bad news all the time. Just like I did with Mr. Clark this morning. Who does his daughter always remind me of?
16571	J.D.'s Thoughts	Molly Ringwald! Heh. Man, she was good in 'The Breakfast Club'. I should rent that again.
16572	J.D.	Hello? ... Yes, this _is_ J.D.! ... I'd _love_ to pick you up at jail!
16573	Elliot	Slim, what are you in for?
16574	Criminal	Robbery.
16575	Elliot	Mm. Prostitution!
16576	Carla	Would you please stop enjoying this so much?
16577	Elliot	Mm! Photo-op!
16578	Elliot	Slammer!
16579	Carla	You need to get your arm off me before I throw that phone of yours up in the street.
16580	Elliot	Why you gotta be playa-hatin'?
16581	J.D.	Konnichiwa.
16582	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16583	Dr. Cox	Ohhh, hey Dr. Turk, you old turtle-headed pain in the ass. Aw! Dammit all, Perry, that is _so_ not what you came down here to say! Now you're _better_ than that! Turn the car around!
16584	Turk	Oh, so the worm has turned, huh? Don't bother. That's what's wrong with you medical guys. You ... never ... know ... when ... to ... face reality and realize that things are never gonna change between us!
16585	Turk	Ohh! Hell yeah!
16586	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16587	Elliot	Mm, it's so nice to have real food again.
16588	Carla	Elliot, they didn't even feed us.
16589	Danni	I love how much you guys care about your patients.
16590	J.D.'s Thoughts	Wow. Danni is so sweet. What am I worried about?
16591	Danni	You know, Jordan and I are from around here, and our friend Chuck's a stripper? I'm sure he knows tons of guys that would love to have sex with your patient.
16592	J.D.'s Thoughts	What the hell!? What's it gonna be like when she's at my place!?
16593	J.D.	Danni! Can you have the guys practice in the other room, please?
16594	Danni	Stop being such a fuddy-duddy! Now, who haven't I slept with yet?
16595	J.D.	There'll be banana hammocks everywhere!
16596	Carla	Let's roll.
16597	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16598	Turk	Excellent work, everyone.
16599	Todd	Nurse, I know you're new here, so I wanted to offer you the chance to assist me in a bypass later. And by that I mean we'd bypass the kissing and go straight to the
16600	Todd	Oh, my God, you're a dude?
16601	Turk	Sorry, Larry.
16602	Todd	Aw, I feel so bad. Look, I'll make it up to him. I will hook him up with......that chick!
16603	Turk	Dude, that's Larry again.
16604	Todd	Ohhh!
16605	Dr. Cox	Oh, hello, and welcome to McSurgeon's. May I take your order? "Yeah, I was thinking about getting a simple operation with no unexpected complications, please?" Oh, gosh, here I'm sorry, we're fresh out of those. But! If you have a child, maybe you'd like to try one of our Infection Meals! That'll be seven thousand dollars, please pay at the second window.
16606	Turk	You know, I'm really getting sick of this
16607	Dr. Cox	Oh! I'm sorry! Are you talking? Because I've decided to keep my finger on the button, so I actually can't hear anything that's going on in there. But, for fairness' sake, I've decided to do your end of the conversation. It goes a little something like this: "Blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, cool hip-hop lingo, blah-blah, blah-blah-blah."
16608	Todd	Don't worry, sweetheart, this'll all be over in a second.
16609	Larry	Please stop.
16610	Todd	Oh! It's the hips that fool me.

16612	Elliot	Hm! Can't believe Chuck gave up stripping to become a city councilman!

16614	Elliot	Pff! True dat!
16615	Carla	Elliot! You ain't as ghetto as ya think y'are, 'kay? Let's go see how Maggie's doing.
16616	Patient	Hey.
16617	Dr. Cox	Can I help you?
16618	Patient	No. He told me to say hi.
16619	Turk	That's Stephanie, our new transplant patient.
16620	Dr. Cox	Oh. And you picked her, so I'm quite sure she is so very nice.
16621	Turk	No, actually she's alienated every member of my surgical team.
16622	Dr. Cox	Sweetheart, you're not even _on_ the surgical team.
16623	Turk	I am a very important part of the team that! I am a very important part of the team, thankyouverymuch.
16624	Dr. Cox	I see, so what, that's...that's it? You say she gets the liver and that's the way it goes?
16625	Turk	No, she gets the liver because she followed the rules.
16626	Dr. Cox	Ah-ha.
16627	Turk	Dr. Cox, I know it's really hard on you medical guys, because you spend most of your time with your patients and you get emotionally attached. But as a surgeon, the person I'm closest to is the guy who's giving us the liver, because it's a gift, and I think it's important that it goes to the person that's proven they're up to the responsibility.
16628	Dr. Cox	Holy cow, I get it. I gotta collect myself for a moment, here. That's very touching.
16629	Turk	You know I'm right.
16630	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes we forget that rules are there for a reason. Other times, well...
16631	Carla	Uh, she's sleeping, sir.
16632	Dr. Kelso	So?
16633	Elliot	You know, there's cupcakes down in Pediatrics!
16634	Dr. Kelso	Ooh!
16635	J.D.'s Narration	Other times, rules are meant to be broken.
16636	Lawyer	You are so beautiful.
16637	Maggie	That was worth the wait! You are a stallion!
16638	J.D.'s Narration	And once in a while, you have to throw all the rules out the window and know that everything's gonna be okay.
16639	Danni	I feel really good about this!
16640	J.D.	Me too!
16641	J.D.'s Narration	...Or not.
16642	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, some rules are just plain silly.
16643	Dr. Cox	Ya got big plans for tonight?
16644	Carla	Oh.... It's Turk's stupid rule, I don't wanna talk about it.
16645	Dr. Cox	He is a complete tool.... But I suppose you could do a lot worse.
16646	Carla	Thanks.
16647	Dr. Cox	Bye.

16649	J.D.	Hey, Chocolate Bear. I didn't have time to shower this morning. Did you wax your dome?
16650	Turk	I sure did! Why?
16651	J.D.	Thanks, pal!
16652	Turk	Uh-huh....
16653	J.D.	Hold up!
16654	J.D.	Chapped!
16655	Turk	Easy, Moose , that stuff is forty bucks a tin.
16656	J.D.'s Narration	With the long hours at a hospital, you don't have time to worry about your appearance.
16657	J.D.'s Narration	It may sound sexist, but with the female doctors, it's slightly more noticeable.
16658	J.D.	Hey, Janice. Is it windy out?
16659	Janice	No. Why do you always ask me that!?
16660	J.D.	Because I'm I'm captain of m-m-my kite-flying team? The M-m-mighty Kites?
16661	J.D.'s Thoughts	Agh! Okay, just say something innocuous.
16662	J.D.	Good morning, gentlemen.
16663	J.D.'s Narration	The truth is most of them don't even bother trying. Except of course...
16664	Elliot	Hey, girlfriends!
16665	J.D.	How do you have the time to look so good every morning?
16666	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16667	Elliot	Oh, this? Heh. Yeah, it doesn't take long.
16668	J.D.'s Narration	I guess everyone has their morning routines.
16669	Mother	Hi, cutie! Since you have so many balls, and too many toys can be over-stimulating for an infant, Brantley here was wondering if he could borrow one to play with!
16670	Dr. Cox	Oh, that's funny, because Jack here was just wondering why the crazy lady who just spent the last hour chain smoking and talking on her cell phone while her kid ate sand would come over to two complete strangers and give them parenting advice!
16671	Jordan	Oh, oh! He also thanked me for not naming him "Brantley"!
16672	Dr. Cox	Y-yeah.
16673	Dr. Cox	I love our family.

16678	&	Whooooaaa.
16679	J.D.	Anyway, where's Danni? We're gonna be late for our movie.
16680	&	WOOOOOOOOOOO!
16681	Danni	Stop. Lemme just go grab a sweater. I love you.
16682	Turk	Wow, she's using the "L word" now.
16683	J.D.	Yeeeaaah, but we're not really that serious.
16684	J.D.	This isn't the movies?
16685	Danni	I just wanted you to see this; because if I move here permanently, this would be the type of place we could afford.
16686	Turk	Out of body experience?
16687	J.D.	Yeah. She wants to move in together. I have to break up with her!
16688	Turk	Dude, relax. Enjoy the show. Have a Bugle.
16689	J.D.	Ooh!
16690	Turk	Ooh, your ghost hands is cold!
16691	Danni	J.D.!?
16692	J.D.	I wanted to put them on my fingers and pretend I had witch nails.
16693	Danni	What?!
16694	J.D.	Nothing.
16695	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16696	Dr. Cox	I just can't believe how comfortable I've gotten talking to you over these last few months. I mean, look, I'd still be with my old shrink if I hadn't cut across the park the day of the renaissance faire and realized that the man I tell my innermost secrets to likes to...likes to put on a big, giant beard and make pretend that he is a blacksmith.
16697	A-a-a-anyway, something weird's been going on with me lately	I have been sleeping more, I've been drinking alone...less....
16698	Dr. Cox	...I've even started complimenting people.
16699	Todd	Oh, come on! Get your pump on!
16700	Dr. Cox	God help me, Sluggo, if you get any more buff, I'll be absolutely sure that you're gay!
16701	Todd	Oh, I'm gonna get more buff!
16702	Elliot	Dr. Cox never compliments me about anything!
16703	Janitor	Well, he should. Your new look has completely changed my perspective. For instance, this is not a broom with fraying edges this is now a broom that reminds me of blonde doctor's bangs. Tough and spunky!
16704	Elliot	Oh, my God! That is exactly the look that I was going for!
16705	Janitor	Really!?
16706	Elliot	Yeah!
16707	Janitor	Shoobity-doo! Hey! How 'bout I give you a ride to your next destination?
16708	Elliot	To the morgue! Watch it!
16709	J.D.	Hey!
16710	Turk	So, did you break up with her?
16711	J.D.	I was going to last night, but then I looked in her eyes, and I realized how rare it is to meet someone who's actually willing to have sex with me.
16712	Carla	How did you have sex with the woman you're about to break up with?
16713	J.D.	Okay, you know how the, uh, couch in the living room has those high arms...?
16714	Turk	Babe, you gotta understand, a guy will sleep with any woman he finds attractive, no matter how he feels about her. If Tyra Banks drove her car over my mom and then offered to have sex with me? I'd have to dial 9-1-1 in the nude because my pants would already be off!
16715	Carla	That's sweet! While your mother lays there dying!
16716	Turk	Tell her.
16717	J.D.	His mom doesn't die. Tyra uses her connections in the supermodel world to get government scientists to put Turk's mom's brain into Heidi Klum's body. She falls in love with me, we all move in together.
16718	Turk	It'd be awkward at first, but I'd make it work.... 'Cause I love my mom.
16719	J.D.	Mm, and I would love her, too.
16720	Carla	New low.
16721	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16722	Elliot	Oh, Mrs. Gorski, I know shingles are never fun. Unless you're talking about the games we made up the summer my parents got a new roof. It was kind of like Hide & Seek, only we'd throw shingles at each other? Ahh, summer time.... Still, a positive attitude can go a long way in helping you feel better, so let's see a big ol' smile!
16723	Dr. Kelso	Excuse me. Can I borrow Dr. Reid?
16724	Mrs. Gorski	You may keep her.
16725	Dr. Kelso	Here at Sacred Heart, I like to think that our patients choose our hospital not only because I leak vicious rumors about competing hospitals to the press, but also because when they see one of our doctors they think, "Now that's a professional!"
16726	Elliot	Um, I don't think I look unprofessional.
16727	Dr. Kelso	I've let this whole new look thing slide the last few months, but now that your colleagues are beginning to complain I'm going to give you the same advice I give my son every morning. Lose the makeup! Get a haircut! And stop using my razor to shave your fun zone!
16728	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16729	J.D.	I hate missing practice.
16730	Turk	Me too.
16731	& J.D.	Mighty Kiiiiites!
16732	Dr. Cox	Morning, class. As residency director, it is my pleasure to have both Surgical and Medical personnel here with us today. In fact, in this room we have enough brain power to light up a city! Not a real city, mind you, but definitely a tiny ant city whose government has recently passed a series of stringent energy conservation laws!
16733	Doug	Stringent what?
16734	J.D.	"Stringent updoc".
16735	J.D.	It's happening.
16736	Dr. Cox	Yes, Nervous Guy?
16737	Doug	What's "updoc"?
16738	Dr. Cox	Okay, people, biphasic defibrillators. How many of you had a chance to practice on the mannequin?
16739	Todd	Oh, yeah.
16740	Dr. Cox	...With the defibrillator...?
16741	Todd	Uhhhh....
16742	Elliot	Ugh.
16743	Dr. Cox	And I assume none of you have even looked at the literature.
16744	Dr. Cox	I didn't do anything. No yelling, no breaking stuff, nothing. And right then , I figured out what's different. I figured out what that feeling was that I was having in the park the other day with my family. I'm...happy. Now does that not just make you sick? Ugh!

16746	Turk	Dude, with Danni you just gotta keep your eyes on the prize. Focus in on how great it is to be single! Chasing tail! Hell, I miss it every day.
16747	Carla	Oh, you don't care if you ever have sex again, do you?
16748	Turk	Baby, listen, I'm just trying to keep my man psyched, 'cause since I've known J.D., he's never broken up with anyone.
16749	J.D.	He's right. I don't like hurting people. But with Danni, I'm gonna do the honorable thing I'm gonna have someone in a fireman's outfit tell her I burned to death.
16750	Carla	Bambi, you owe her closure. Hell, you owe it to every woman you've ever dated.
16751	J.D.	Listen, Danni....
16752	J.D.	...Lisa.... Drunk girl who was friends with the girl I really wanted to hook up with.... It's not all of you. It's me.
16753	J.D.	Scott Gerber?!
16754	Scott	At soccer camp, I told you I wanted to be more than friends.
16755	J.D.	I thought you meant teammates!
16756	Scott	Well, I didn't!

16762	Danni	Me too. I just feel like my life is so scattered lately and you're the only good thing I have going right now.
16763	J.D.	Awesome.
16764	Carla	How's he doing?
16765	Nurse Roberts	The boy's got no biscuits.
16766	J.D.	I am trying to break someone's heart here, okay!?
16767	Danni	I'm feeling really bummed. Do you have a second to talk?
16768	J.D.	Actually, I'm kinda swamped right now, uh, let me get back to you, okay?
16769	J.D.	Elliot, what's wrong?
16770	Elliot	Eh, forget it, you're busy.
16771	J.D.	Come on! I always have time for you!
16772	Elliot	Have the other doctors been making fun of the way I look?
16773	Carla	What? No! No way! Why would you say that?
16774	J.D.	Huh? I've never heard anything like that! Why?
16775	Nurse Roberts	Hell, yeah.
16776	Carla	Only the girl ones, and you know, they're all "Mrreeeoww!!"
16777	Todd	Cat fight?

16785	Dr. Cox	Of course you do, but you don't actually expect me
16786	Dr. Cox	Where is everybody?
16787	Doug	They all had really important things to do?
16788	J.D.	Hello, citizens! Welcome to Sacred Heart! Home of the world's most giant doctor! Be not afraid! I'm just like you! Except I'm giant!
16789	J.D.	My tush is chafing.
16790	Turk	All right! My turn to get on top!
16791	J.D.	Turk, we tried playing Giant Black Guy. Remember what happened? People ran.

16793	J.D.	Besides, I gotta go deal with this whole Danni thing.
16794	Turk	You want me to just talk to her for you? I'll do it.
16795	J.D.	Nah, that's weak. I mean, if someone doesn't care about you enough to break up with you themselves, it's like they didn't ever care about you at all.
16796	Jordan	Hey, guys. Ohh! J.D., Danni's breaking up with you. Mm, darn. See ya!
16797	J.D.	What?
16798	Chet	Guys, how many times do I have to tell you? Stop wearing my coat!
16799	Turk	Sorry about that, Chet!
16800	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16801	J.D.	Which one of these is Chet's? We gotta put this coat back.
16802	Turk	Oh...I think it's this one.
16803	Turk	Dude, look at the size of this Odor-Eater! We could surf on it!
16804	J.D.	I still don't understand why Danni's breaking up with me, man. I gotta go talk to her.
16805	J.D.	Okay, first of all, words cannot describe the smell that is currently on my cheek.
16806	Turk	You get out clean, and now you wanna go back in just 'cause she rejected you? Who else is that crazy?
16807	Dr. Cox	Not one resident showed up. Not one. Would you like to know why? Because they're not scared of me anymore. And I blame you. Yes. You have turned me into this soft, emotionally open, pathetic freak at home, and now it's starting to bleed over into work.
16808	Staff	"...Happy birthday to you!"
16809	Dr. Cox	"And many more!"
16810	Dr. Cox	Oh, my...oh, my God!
16811	Carla	Happy birthday!
16812	Nurse Roberts	Oh, dammit, people, I've been here twenty-three years. For the last time, I'm allergic to coconut!
16813	Carla	Elliot.... Have you been in the supply closet, crying?
16814	Elliot	Carla. I don't do that anymore!
16815	Elliot	Oh, my God! I look like Alice Cooper!
16816	Elliot	You know, I shouldn't have to feel bad for wanting to look good. You don't, what with your bohemian scarves and pirate earrings....
16817	Carla	Thank you for noticing.
16818	Carla	Laverne!
16819	Nurse Roberts	Good cake, though.
16820	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16821	J.D.	Hellooo?
16822	Jordan	Little piece of advice: Your honker's cute in person. Peep-hole? Not your friend.
16823	J.D.	Ha! I'm sorry, did I interrupt you from trying to eat your baby?
16824	Jordan	Danni's not here.
16825	J.D.	Look, do you know how hard it was for me to come here?
16826	Turk	Gotcha!
16827	J.D.	Oooog! Oh, God....
16828	Turk	Not getting up until you come to your senses.
16829	Todd	Get your coffee on, dawg.
16830	J.D.	Say what you want, those big round cheeks are warm in the morning....
16831	Jordan	What?
16832	J.D.	I just wanna know why she broke up with me.
16833	Jordan	Well, why don't you just...hey! Ask her yourself!
16834	J.D.	Not cool.
16835	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16836	Dr. Kelso	Now, there you go, sweetheart! Now you look more like a doctor and less like a lap-dance!
16837	Elliot	Thank you, sir.
16838	Janitor	Floor's wet.
16839	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16840	Dr. Cox	So I...I'm pretty much thinking it's time to get the fear back. And I'm sorry, but I think life is just too short to spend your time working someplace where people don't crap their pants at the mere sight of ya.
16841	Dr. Cox	Okay, listen up, people, because this part is crucial. In order to use the biphasic defibrillator, we have
16842	Elliot	Sorry I'm late.
16843	Todd	Hey, Elliot. Is it greasy outside?
16844	J.D.	Oh, that is so stupid. Elliot, you look...smart.
16845	Dr. Cox	Hello?
16846	Elliot	Of course I'm smart I'm a doctor!
16847	Doug	"What's up, doc?" I just got it!
16848	J.D.	Maybe that's why Danni wants to break up with me, she thinks I'm too smart!
16849	Todd	You're dating a guy named Danny? Is he hot?
16850	J.D.	Listen....
16851	J.D.'s Narration	I know it's a cliché, but ______ say that it is indeed the calm before the storm that lets you know that danger's coming.
16852	J.D.'s Thoughts	Uh-oh.
16853	Dr. Cox	First off, let me just say...thank you. For the last couple of months I have been adrift in a sea of puppy dogs, lollipops, and, let's face it, mediocre metaphors. Luckily, you people were kind enough to piss all over learning a procedure that could determine whether some poor sucker lives or dies. And that reminded me of something that I wanted to remind _you_ of. Because, you see, I am accountable. I am accountable for the continuous, crashing, undeniable amateurism that you people drag into this hospital day in and day out.
16854	Dr. Cox	Okay! Nervous Guy! Bring that nervous butt up here, lose the shirt; we're gonna show these good people how this thing works.
16855	Dr. Cox	Nice tan, there, champ.
16856	Doug	Thanks?
16857	Dr. Cox	Clear!
16858	J.D.'s Narration	After Dr. Cox exploded at us, so many thoughts were racing through my head: We have been slacking off lately. How did Doug get such incredible abs? And what the hell is the deal with Danni?
16859	Danni	Hey.
16860	J.D.	Hey.
16861	J.D.	After you dressed up Rowdy, did you trim the clumpy areas around his butt?
16862	Danni	Yeah...?
16863	J.D.	Oh.... Thanks. He was due for a good grooming.
16864	Danni	Look....
16865	J.D.	Just tell me why.
16866	Danni	Your cell phone wasn't turned off.
16867	J.D.	What?
16868	Danni	When you called me.
16869	J.D.	Actually I'm swamped, Danni. Sorry, I gotta go.
16870	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16871	J.D.	Elliot, what's wrong?
16872	Elliot	Oh.... Forget it, you're busy.
16873	J.D.	Come on! I always have time for you!
16874	J.D.	That stupid phone! You know, that's the same way Turk found out I collect scarves!
16875	J.D.'s Thoughts	Ooooh!
16876	Danni	J.D.
16877	J.D.	Sorry.
16878	Danni	you're still not over Elliot. And until you are, no one's ever gonna have a chance to get close to you. Right?
16879	Danni	That silence? That's you breaking up with me.
16880	J.D.'s Thoughts	Hey! I finally broke up with someone!
16881	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16882	Carla	How you doing, Elliot?
16883	Elliot	Great! I figure I spend three quarters of my life in a place filled with misery and sickness; if I need to feel good about myself, then the hell with everybody!
16884	Carla	And for what it's worth, I think you look beautiful I wouldn't change a thing.
16885	Elliot	Ohh.... Oh! I did, uh, tone down the eye makeup a little bit.
16886	Carla	Oh, thank God! You looked so slutty.
16887	Elliot	There! All done.
16888	Mrs. Gorski	I look hot!
16889	J.D.'s Narration	Everybody has their own way of getting through the day.
16890	J.D.'s Narration	For some, it's as simple as standing up for a friend...
16891	J.D.'s Narration	...and getting away with it.
16892	Dr. Cox	I I know what you're thinking, believe me, I...I do: Why in the world would a civilized, up-town man of the millennium such as myself even go ahead and give a good rat's ass about whether a bunch of snot-nosed baby docs were afraid of him. Right? Well, unfortunately the only way I know how to teach is through fear.
16893	Dr. Cox	And again, sorry about the gay sailor's outfit. Your mother _loves_ it. She couldn't be more pleasant when you have it on. Take it off nut bag. Have it on pleasant, approachable....
16894	J.D.'s Narration	As for me, if I'm not over Elliot, I might as well wait it out for the long haul. After all, it doesn't mean I'm gonna ignore opportunity if it falls in my lap.

16896	J.D.	Hey! Sheila!
16897	Sheila	Leave me alone.
16898	J.D.	Okay...!
16899	Elliot	J.D.! Let's get going. Sean's calling me at home in like ten minutes.
16900	J.D.'s Narration	Oh, this is gonna suck.
16901	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16902	J.D.'s Narration	Everyone here thinks they know me inside and out.
16903	Female Staffer	You look like you could use some help.
16904	J.D.	Nope.
16905	J.D.'s Narration	Even random people.
16906	Male Staffer	You need help, Dr. Dorian?
16907	J.D.	No thanks, Dr...whatever your name is.
16908	J.D.'s Narration	They won't leave me alone.
16909	Doctor	Free help, here.
16910	J.D.	Piss off, Mickhead.
16911	J.D.'s Narration	You'd think by now they'd know where I'm gonna end up.
16912	J.D.	Dr. Cox? I could use a little help.
16913	Dr. Cox	Beyoncé, you could use a lot of help. But, hey, we all have to play the hand the Big Guy dealt us. You know, unless you're lucky enough to have those insanely over-hyped 'Queer Eye' guys show up at your door, but I doubt even they have the brass ones necessary to fix whatever the hell this is.
16914	J.D.	Yeah, if you wanna use the appearance angle to knock down my self-esteem, best to do it on a day when my hair doesn't look awesome! I know it's new wax.
16915	Nurse Roberts	What is?
16916	J.D.	It's okay to want a piece!
16917	J.D.	I just want you to check out Mrs. Barlow's chart; I'm always second-guessing myself when it comes to interstitial lung diseases.
16918	Dr. Cox	Oh, then you should definitely handle this yourself, there, Britney.
16919	J.D.	Got it.
16920	Dr. Cox	Noo.... I'm a good doctor.
16921	J.D.	Oh.
16922	Dr. Cox	Here you go.
16923	Turk	Oh, hello, Mr. Gallbladder. Don't you get too comfy next to Mr. Liver. Because here comes Dr. Turk's robot laser.
16924	Dr. Wen	Hey, Christopher. I could do without the color commentary.
16925	Turk	Why it gotta be a "color commentary"? 'Cause I'm doing it?
16926	Dr. Wen	That was a near-perfect laparoscopic cholecystectomy!
16927	Dr. Wen	Have you been working on your dexterity?
16928	Turk	Well, I've been playing a little John Madden Football on my X-Box....
16929	Todd	I'd like to play John Madden Football...on _her_ x-box.
16930	Turk	On who, Todd? There are no women here.
16931	Todd	Well, it's still funny!
16932	Dr. Wen	The Todd here used to be our number one lap-chole guy. But the torch has been passed.
16933	Turk	Thank you, sir!
16934	Turk	Dude! Yo, wait till you hear this!
16935	Turk	Dr. Wen just said that I'm their number one lap-chole guy now!
16936	Dr. Wen	Disappointed?
16937	Todd	I shoulda waited till there was a chick around to make that "x-box" joke, you know?
16938	Todd	He knows....
16939	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
16940	J.D.'s Narration	I was excited for Turk. And, God bless him, he was excited about my big hair news!
16941	Turk	New wax did that?
16942	J.D.	I couldn't believe it either!
16943	Carla	New wax did that?
16944	Elliot	I couldn't believe it either!
16945	Carla	Oh.
16946	Carla	Ye oh, sorry about the girl talk.
16947	J.D.	Oh, that's fine. We were talking man talk...you know....
16948	Turk	Really big trucks...
16949	J.D.	Solo-Flex...
16950	Turk	Have you seen these lately?
16951	J.D.	Sweat.
16952	Carla	Your hair smells like Elliot's.
16953	J.D.	Well, your breath smells like chimichangas!
16954	Carla	Is that racist?
16955	Elliot	That depends. Did you have chimichangas for breakfast?
16956	Carla	Maybe....
16957	J.D.'s Narration	I think what Carla really smelled was all the excitement in the air. See, there's a visiting professor coming today who's both a medical attending and a surgeon. _Two_ specialties, and to us that kinda makes him...
16958	J.D.'s Narration	...Super-Doc!
16959	J.D.'s Narration	...Super-Doc...
16960	Dr. Casey	Dammit!
16961	J.D.'s Narration	...Fine. A super-doc with obsessive-compulsive disorder.
16962	Dr. Casey	Okay, okay. How hard can it be for me to step in here, left foot first and simultaneously exhale as my right foot plants? How hard?
16963	Turk	Not that hard?
16964	Dr. Casey	Exactly! ...Shaved-head guy.
16965	Carla	Hers.
16966	Carla	And his.
16967	J.D.	Huh?
16968	Dr. Casey	That's very pretty. And deeply disturbing.
16969	J.D.	The jar said unisex.
16970	Turk	I know.
16971	J.D.	_Unisex_.

16977	Dr. Casey	That's the word! Dr. Kevin Casey....
16978	Carla	Why do you keep saying your name?
16979	Dr. Casey	Oh, it just keeps me from losing my, uh...jinkies later, thinking I forgot something.
16980	Carla	Okay....
16981	Dr. Casey	Dr. Kevin Casey.... Dr. Kevin Casey.
16982	Dr. Casey	It's okay, you can say it.
16983	J.D.	It's just that you're...you're a doctor with pretty severe OCD.
16984	Dr. Casey	It's not a secret.
16985	J.D.	I know. I always talk like this.
16986	Dr. Casey	You're gonna have a hard time keeping that up the whole month I'm here.
16987	J.D.	I can do it!
16988	Dr. Casey	I believe in you!
16989	Dr. Cox	Kevin Casey? Holy cow, get outta Dodge! Te-tell me this, are you are ya shaking hands nowadays?
16990	Dr. Casey	Well, a lifetime of therapy...and a...whole lotta Zoloft...just so I can appropriately greet you, big guy!
16991	Dr. Cox	Atta boy!
16992	Dr. Casey	I do have a two-second limit.
16993	Dr. Cox	Boy, who doesn't!
16994	Dr. Cox	You realize I haven't laid eyes on you since we were residents together? And I'll tell you this, big Kev-o, I always knew I'd see ya again.
16995	Dr. Cox	Boy, I never thought I'd see that guy again!
16996	J.D.	I can't imagine you as a resident.
16997	Resident	Hey, Coxy!
16998	Dr. Cox	Shut up, jackass! I rock!
16999	J.D.	Was the blond hair and the earring 'cause you were in a rock band or 'cause you loved pirates?
17000	Dr. Cox	What?
17001	J.D.'s Thoughts	Loved pirates! Just like me!
17002	Nurse Roberts	I _don't_ want a piece.
17003	J.D.	Well you're the only one. Okay?
17004	Dr. Cox	Look, Pink, for the billionth time, no, I will not go out for a beer with you. Now repeat after me: Dr. Cox, you are not now, nor will you ever be, my mentor.

17010	Dr. Kelso	Stop babbling, Ted. No one's ever listening.
17011	Janitor	My new associate Randall and I can get rid of that garbage for you.

17014	Randall	And drink beer.
17015	Janitor	Only the winner drinks beer.
17016	Dr. Kelso	How much to make the garbage go away?

17023	J.D.'s Narration	I have to say it was amazing watching Dr. Casey work.
17024	Dr. Casey	All right, Carol, let's just put it out there you've got Lupus. But instead of dwelling on the negative, let's look at the positive signs, okay? Your, uh, pericarditis is resolving, your renal function is good
17025	Dr. Cox	Suicidal scavenger birds also an excellent sign, right Doctor?
17026	J.D.	It's a great sign.
17027	Dr. Casey	Okie-dokie, artichokie.
17028	J.D.	You are unflappable!
17029	Dr. Casey	It's true I can't be flapped.
17030	J.D.	I'm more skittish.
17031	Dr. Casey	Yeah, you know, you're like a big squirrel.
17032	J.D.	I wish a was a swashbuckling doctor. You know...like a pirate.
17033	J.D.'s Thoughts	Enough about pirates! Wait until you know him better.
17034	Dr. Casey	Ahoy, there.
17035	J.D.	You going to the, uh... O.Arrr? Heh.
17036	J.D.'s Thoughts	I said enough!
17037	Dr. Casey	You know, I couldn't have survived in medicine if I didn't embrace my OCD. And since I was compulsive anyway, you know, I I read the same text books over and over, I, uh, I went through the procedures over and over, I imagined every worst-case scenario over and over and over and over and over and over and over
17038	J.D.	Dr. Casey.
17039	Dr. Casey	and over and over and over
17040	J.D.	Dr. Casey!

17042	J.D.	Oh.
17043	Dr. Casey	Thank you.
17044	J.D.	Yeah.
17045	Dr. Casey	Even though my crazy brain made me do those things, it's still the best advice I can give to any young doctor: Expect the unexpected and you will never be surprised.
17046	J.D.'s Narration	It's weird, after one day it already felt like he was the type of mentor I always wished Dr. Cox would be. Still, I've gotta stay cool; I know I'm prone to hero worship.
17047	Dr. Casey	Man, the surgeon in me is antsy. I need to cut somebody up.
17048	Dr. Casey	Thanks for volunteering. I'm not really that strong on the brain. I think this is the language center.
17049	J.D.	Really? 'Cause I don't feel the daaaaaaaiiiiiioooooooowwww...heh-heh-how cool is thaaaat!

17062	Turk	What?
17063	Elliot	If there is one thing I've learned at this hospital, it's that you should never antagonize your boss...or the people that make the food, because either way you end up eating poo. Hear it, learn it, live it. Huh?
17064	Turk	Elliot, I can do whatever I want. Because these......are magic!
17065	Turk	These? Are gonna take me wherever I wanna go in life.
17066	Turk	Thanks to these! I'm king of the world, baby! Can you feel it!? Gimme your pudding!!

17081	Carla	You get out.
17082	Dr. Cox	I know. But soon enough I established myself as the best damn doctor that ever roamed around these filthy halls; which is a curse, actually, because now I'm expected to make eye contact with every insult to medicine that comes into this dump.

17084	Dr. Cox	Thank. You.

17087	Carla	Don't tell me The Great One is stumped!
17088	Dr. Cox	No. It's just that this is not exactly the kind of thing that you stick your head in on and figure out.
17089	Dr. Casey	He's got Gaucher's disease.
17090	Dr. Cox	I beg your pardon?
17091	Dr. Casey	I took the liberty of testing his blood for deficiency of beta-glucosidase.
17092	Dr. Cox	Ohhh! I just sent out for one of those!
17093	Carla	No you didn't!
17094	Dr. Cox	Uh-shh!
17095	Dr. Casey	Well, you know, I I mean, I never would've have figured it out if you hadn't done the grunt work. You know, it's like a jar of pickles: you loosened the lid and pop! I took it off.

17108	Dr. Casey	Okay, I'll see you at four.
17109	Turk	Cool trick.
17110	Dr. Casey	Yeah, you should try it. It's good for dexterity, concentration...and convincing single women you're a power-dork.
17111	Turk	You know, I'm really looking forward to seeing you in action, sir. It takes a lot to make the big dog sit up and take notice. Heh.
17112	Dr. Casey	I believe the word you're looking for is "holy crap."
17113	Turk	Holy crap!

17115	Doug	I'm sorry, J.D., I just don't think pirates are cool.
17116	J.D.	Well then you're not cool, Doug!
17117	Dr. Casey	J.D., do you wanna get a beer tonight?
17118	J.D.	Do chickens wish they could fly?
17119	Dr. Casey	I have no idea.
17120	J.D.	I like to think they do.
17121	Dr. Casey	So do I.
17122	Dr. Cox	Okay, class! We have a guest with us at rounds today, happens to be an old friend of yours truly, so let's all go out of our way to treat him with the respect he deserves. Nnnnnnnn'kay?
17123	Dr. Casey	Hey, gang. My name is Dr. Kevin Cas
17124	Dr. Cox	Anyway! I thought we'd change things up a little bit today instead of me firing questions at you, I'd like to see you all scurry away and get your text books. And when you get back, you actually get to quiz us.
17125	Dr. Cox	A little harmless competition, if my colleague here will consent to it?
17126	Dr. Casey	I'm sorry; are you done with the speechifying?
17127	Dr. Casey	I'm kidding, you frightening bastard!
17128	Dr. Cox	Oh-ho-hokay, buddy-buddy-buddy! Oh! Buddy-buddy-buddy-buddy-buddy! GO GET YOUR BOOKS!
17129	Dr. Casey	Try not to touch me as much.
17130	Dr. Cox	Fair enough.

17132	Dr. Kelso	Now look, security said your van hasn't left the premises. So I demand to know where all the trash is going.
17133	Janitor	...Away.
17134	Dr. Kelso	I'm going to tell you the same thing I told the grocer when it was my turn to bring the deli spread to Hank Weinberg's poker night: This better be kosher. Otherwise, it's not just Ted who's gonna pay for it.
17135	Ted the Lawyer	If people keep pushing me for no reason, I swear I will hurl myself off this building!
17136	Janitor	I'm not cleaning you up.
17137	Randall	Arm.
17138	Ted the Lawyer	Mark my words! If one more person is mean to me for no reason, I'll do it!
17139	Nurse Roberts	Shut up, bozo.
17140	Ted the Lawyer	One more person. She didn't know the rules.

17142	Dr. Cox	Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! One of you minions spit out another question, will ya! Yo! Nervous Guy
17143	Dr. Cox	now I don't care how many times your little prepubescent voice cracks. Hit me, baby!
17144	Doug	Okay.... Wh-what is the demyelinating CNS disorder associated with the JC virus?
17145	Dr. Cox	Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Snore!
17146	Dr. Casey	Yeah, short jokes are a sign of desperation, my friend.
17147	Randall	Amen, brother.
17148	Elliot	Uh......uh...uh...over...here!
17149	Dr. Casey	Uh, yes...blonde girl.... You have yet _another_ question?
17150	Elliot	Um, what is the pathologic abnormality causing Bernard-Soulier disease?
17151	Dr. Casey	Absence of von Willebrand receptors. Uh, listen, I hate to be childish about this, but I have to, uh..."make". And for me that involves driving home and scrubbing the toilet seat several times with industrial-strength cleanser. So, if we could just call this a tie...?
17152	Dr. Cox	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Ties are for sissies. Speaking of which, Newbie? You have been uncharacteristically quiet.
17153	J.D.'s Narration	I don't know why it popped into my head...
17154	J.D.	You really had trouble with metabolic diseases?
17155	Dr. Cox	Noo.... I'm a good doctor.
17156	J.D.'s Narration	...but I knew I had him.
17157	J.D.	My question is concerning metabolic diseases.
17158	J.D.	Oh, yes.
17159	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
17160	Dr. Cox	Okay, first I think that we should...we should go over the rules. Because, you see, if by some freak of nature I'm not able to answer a question, then old Kev-Kev here cannot be declared the winner unless he can provide the answer for said question. Otherwise we're just going back and forth, back an
17161	Dr. Casey	Fabry's Disease. Page two thousand, ninety-eight of Harrison's Guide to Internal Medicine.
17162	J.D.'s Narration	It's funny how one person can shake another's foundation to the core. Half the time, the guy doesn't even know he did it!
17163	Dr. Wen	Watching Dr. Casey's procedure again?
17164	Turk	He's so fast.
17165	Dr. Wen	Yep. He's out of our league.
17166	J.D.'s Narration	Funnier still how the same guy could be the mentor I've always been looking for.
17167	Dr. Casey	Nice place. It's got that that great...vomit and peanut smell.
17168	J.D.	Yeah.... Reminds me of my first girlfriend. She was a carnie.
17169	J.D.	You know, I'm always trying to get Cox to come out and get a beer with me he never does.
17170	Dr. Casey	Hey, you're not one of those guys who carries around pictures of him and his attending, are you?
17171	J.D.	Ahhhh, perfect!
17172	J.D.	Well, I don't carry anything around....
17173	Dr. Casey	Good. 'Cause you know, those those losers who've been practicing medicine for three years but are still looking for some kind of mentor to pat 'em on the back are just...pathetic, you know what I mean?
17174	J.D.	Totally.
17175	J.D.'s Narration	Yep. It's funny what one person can do.
17176	Dr. Casey	Aw, okay, I'm gonna need another beer.
17177	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
17178	J.D.'s Narration	None of us slept last night. How I know that is irrelevant. What does matter is I think we formed a special bond because of it.
17179	Dr. Cox	Stop looking at me or die.
17180	J.D.'s Narration	What's worse is that the guy who caused it thinks we're his best friends.
17181	Dr. Casey	Morning, fellas!
17182	Dr. Cox	Whatta say there, Kev.
17183	J.D.	Hey, yeah.
17184	Turk	Eh, morning.
17185	Dr. Casey	All right, all six of your butt cheeks just, uh, tightened up.
17186	Dr. Cox	Uh.
17187	J.D.	Uh.
17188	Turk	Uh?
17189	Dr. Casey	Someone around here pissing you guys off? 'Cause I will give 'em some attitude.
17190	J.D.	Uhhh.... That guy!
17191	Dr. Casey	Hey, Hair Club! That suit, that come with the flop sweat?
17192	Ted the Lawyer	You can do this, Theodore! Take as much time as you need.

17196	Jordan	Carla, Perry is a dysfunctional, unsuccessful, emotionally-damaged old man! No offense, sweetie.
17197	Dr. Cox	None taken.
17198	Jordan	Being the best doctor here is the only thing he had to hang his hat on.
17199	Dr. Cox	Listen, just because we have a child together doesn't necessarily mean you know me, mmm'kay, princess? Watch and learn.
17200	Dr. Cox	Say, Kev-Kev? Would you love to come and join us?
17201	Dr. Casey	Oh, thanks.
17202	Carla	Um, what's up with the oatmeal today?
17203	Dr. Cox	Too much milk.
17204	Carla	No.
17205	Dr. Casey	Not enough butter.
17206	Carla	That's it!
17207	Dr. Cox	Did you just diagnose the oatmeal? You can't just go and diagnose the oatmeal.
17208	Jordan	He just did.
17209	Dr. Casey	Yeah. Why, are you?
17210	Jordan	I'm thinking about it.
17211	Carla	Heh. Yeah, me too.
17212	Dr. Cox	What what in the hell...just happened? Just.... J What just happened!?

17215	Elliot	Oh, my God! You can't even beat Dr. Kevin Casey's lap-chole time when you're _imagining_ it!
17216	Turk	So! I could be just as fast if I was like him and practiced over and over again on a simulator.
17217	Elliot	Yeah...but you don't.
17218	Turk	Yeah, well I could spend my spare time doing stupid hand exercises!
17219	Elliot	I know...but you don't.
17220	Turk	Yeah, well, I could
17221	Elliot	You don't.
17222	Turk	But
17223	Elliot	Don't!
17224	Turk	Could you enjoy this any less?
17225	Elliot	Because of theeeeeeeese! I don't think I can.
17226	Turk	In! Gallbladder! Out! Done! Four seconds! A new record! World record!
17227	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
17228	J.D.	Look, I did my psych rotation, okay? I know my father abandoning us and only showing up in my life when he needs a place to sleep or a free prostate exam is probably gonna be an issue. I get it. But it's not like I'm looking for a a mentor...I just want a little validation. It's like when Kelso gave you a cupcake 'cause you went four days without killing a patient.
17229	Doug	That was awesome!
17230	J.D.	You know!
17231	J.D.'s Thoughts	I've always felt like Doug understood me. It's weird; after knowing him for three years, I suddenly realized he was the type of mentor I always wished Dr. Cox would be.
17232	J.D.'s Thoughts	Wait!
17233	J.D.	Doug, get the hell outta here!
17234	Doug	Okay.
17235	J.D.'s Narration	I think when rational men are forced to face their shortcomings they all do the same thing: Blame Kevin Casey! Who gave him the right to judge me? 'Cause I sure didn't! I'll give him a piece of my mind! See how he likes it! Unfortunately no one knew where the son of a bitch was!
17236	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Dorian! I'm far too irritable right now to pretend I don't hate you, so let's cut to the chase.
17237	Dr. Kelso	If you know where all the garbage in this hospital is going, I'll give you......eight dollars.
17238	J.D.	Sorry, sir.
17239	Janitor	Thanks!
17240	Dr. Kelso	Huh?
17241	Carla	Dr. Kelso?
17242	Dr. Kelso	What?
17243	Carla	The crows are back. They're making your pimp-mobile look like SpinArt.
17244	Dr. Kelso	Dammit!
17245	Ted the Lawyer	It's just one step. Come on, already! Aww, who'm I kidding?
17246	Ted the Lawyer	You did it, Teddy! It's over! Here comes sweet relief!
17247	Ted the Lawyer	Is this heaven?
17248	Janitor	It's garbage.
17249	Randall	Way to cost us a cherry gig, bra.
17250	Ted the Lawyer	Wha?
17251	Dr. Kelso	I want my money back! And Ted! Shower and get back to work!
17252	Janitor	You know, if you try that around the corner, you can land right in the street.

17254	J.D.'s Thoughts	Found him! Brace yourself, mister! You're about to get an earful! J.D. style!
17255	J.D.	Hey, buddy.
17256	Dr. Casey	Hey...hey.... Uh, give give me a minute, will you?
17257	J.D.	No, Kevin, I have to talk to you _right_ _now_.
17258	Dr. Casey	DAMMIT!
17259	J.D.	Later's cool too.
17260	Dr. Casey	I'm sorry. I just, I... Look, I spent the last few days meeting new people and...trying to get used to this place, and I'm stressed and I'm fried......and I just want to go home.... But here's the punchline: even though my last surgery was two hours ago, I can't stop washing my damn hands.
17261	Dr. Casey	AAAAAAAAGGGGGGGHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
17262	J.D.	I'm sorry....
17263	Dr. Casey	No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look...this is a weak moment. Nobody's supposed to see this. And, uh, mark my words, I'll clean up the soap. ...Probably several thousand times.
17264	Dr. Casey	Everyone's got their own burdens, J.D., and I'm not gonna be one of those people that dumps mine on somebody else. Now whatta you need?
17265	J.D.	Nothing.
17266	J.D.'s Narration	None of us needed anything.

17273	Dr. Cox	You, my friend, are going to be the best baseball player in the world. Which will make me the best baseball player in the world's father.
17274	Dr. Cox	Can't you hear it, Jack? Can't you hear it?
17275	J.D.'s Narration	Still, it's not that daunting if you look around and see what other people have to deal with.
17276	J.D.	Goodnight, Dr. Casey.
17277	Dr. Casey	'Night, J.D.
17278	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
17279	J.D.'s Narration	I'm running a little late this morning, but that's okay because I've been working with Dr. Casey the last few weeks.
17280	Dr. Casey	Bink. Bink. Bink. Bink, bink bink...
17281	J.D.'s Narration	...by touching everything in his first patient's room.
17282	Dr. Casey	...Bink, bink, bink, bink. Bink. Bink. Bink. Bink.
17283	Dr. Casey	Bink, bink, bink, bink, bink, bink, bink, bink, bink, bink...
17284	Dr. Kelso	Good morning, doctors.
17285	J.D.'s Narration	He touches everything.
17286	Dr. Casey	Bink.
17287	Dr. Kelso	Oh. Okay. I suppose that's how they say good morning in Cuckoo Town.
17288	Dr. Casey	Pretty much. Bink.
17289	Dr. Kelso	Now. Your patients on this wing have all been complaining about odd noises.
17290	Dr. Casey	Oh, if it's a "bink" I can explain.
17291	Dr. Kelso	It isn't "bink"! Stop saying "bink"!
17292	J.D.	Was it "I come from the land down under! Where women glow and men plunder!" That wasn't me.
17293	Dr. Kelso	Just figure it out, dammit!
17294	Dr. Casey	Do you plunder?
17295	J.D.	I have been known to plunder.
17296	Janitor	That, my friends, is a roof toilet.
17297	Dr. Casey	I'm sorry, you said that like it's a normal thing.
17298	J.D.	Be careful with this guy, he's uh....
17299	Janitor	Hey! You're the guy that's been using up all my soap!
17300	Dr. Casey	Yeah, I've got OCD.
17301	Janitor	Really!? My grandpa had that. Every morning he'd take a gym sock, fill it up with nickels, and just beat us! That's OCD, right?
17302	J.D.	The bad kind.
17303	Dr. Casey	Who would use this thing?
17304	Janitor	You kiddin'? Oh, man! Just picture yourself, you're standing out here, in the open air, then you sit down and you take stock of your life.
17305	J.D.'s Thoughts	Damn him. He's right.
17306	Janitor	Listen, pal. I don't want you telling anybody about my epiphany toilet.
17307	J.D.	Who'm I gonna tell?
17308	Janitor	Ehp! Don't even think about it!
17309	J.D.	And get this: He calls it his "epiphany toilet"!
17310	Elliot	Yeah, you couldn't pay me to poop on the roof.
17311	Turk	No one's offering.
17312	J.D.	You're like Dr. Casey. I think he said using that toilet would be like his Everest.
17313	Dr. Casey	Using that toilet would be my Everest.
17314	J.D.	Yep, that's what he said.
17315	Turk	Huh.
17316	Carla	Ask him.
17317	Turk	Why?
17318	Carla	J.D.!
17319	Turk	Huh?
17320	Carla	Turk wants to ask you something, and it would mean a lot to the both of us if you said yes.
17321	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, my God! _Would_ I have a threesome with Turk and Carla? Well, it's certainly flattering, and I don't think they'd tell anyone....
17322	Turk	Will you be my best man?
17323	J.D.	Oh.
17324	Turk	Huh?
17325	J.D.	I mean, YEAH! Of course!
17326	Turk	Hell yeah, you will!
17327	J.D.	Thank you so much!
17328	Turk	You're my buddy! Yeah!
17329	Elliot	So is this, like, the best moment you guys have ever had?
17330	J.D.	A decoder ring! Heh.
17331	J.D.	TURK!
17332	Turk	What?
17333	J.D.	It finally happened!
17334	Turk	A double-prizer?
17335	Turk	That was awesome.
17336	Carla	You guys realize you're doctors, right?
17337	J.D.	Double secret decoder ring-wearing doctors.

17339	J.D.	Form of an ice menorah!
17340	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
17341	J.D.'s Narration	The reason I'm gurney surfing aside from the fact that it's totally bitchin' is that Kelso shut down this whole wing.
17342	Turk	Dude, I gotta go.
17343	J.D.	Oh, no!
17344	Turk	Oh!
17345	J.D.'s Narration	You see, a census said that hospital admissions dropped in February.
17346	J.D.'s Narration	The census...was wrong.
17347	Carla	Dr. Kelso! Where are we gonna fit these people? They're all sick!
17348	Dr. Kelso	It's not my job to take care of sick people.

17351	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
17352	J.D.'s Narration	It's weird how much Dr. Casey has influenced me in such a short time.
17353	J.D.	Bink!
17354	Nurse Roberts	Hey! Bink you!
17355	J.D.'s Narration	And it wasn't just me. Dr. Casey has affected everyone.
17356	J.D.	What's he doing?
17357	Elliot	He's writing Dr. Casey a thank-you card.
17358	Todd	I could use a little help here.
17359	Turk	Todd, surgeon is spelled "-g-e-o-n"? And, uh...there are two Ds in "Todd".
17360	Todd	Yeah....
17361	Dr. Cox	I'm sorry, does mean stare at me like jackasses or does it mean get the hell over here?
17362	Dr. Cox	All right, then. Mr. Tanaka here is fatiguing and he needs to be intubated. Any questions?
17363	J.D.	Yeah, Turk has asked me to be his best man. You got any advice?
17364	Dr. Cox	Nuh-no. No. I don't. Not at this moment.
17365	Elliot	You know what sucks? Everyone keeps talking about how Dr. Casey has helped them, and he doesn't even know I exist!
17366	J.D.	So introduce yourself.
17367	Elliot	I haven't seen him all day. He's probably off trying to help figure out some procedure that's gonna help save humanity!
17368	Dr. Casey	Why can't I sit on you!? Why?
17369	J.D.	Probably.
17370	Dr. Cox	Newbie! It turns out I, uh, I do have some best man advice. Go easy on the mascara in case you cry during your toast. And if you're gonna chase after the bouquet with all of the other girls, make sure you kick off your pumps so you don't snap one of those chicken ankles of yours.
17371	J.D.	Thanks. Thanks for coming back.
17372	Dr. Cox	Barbie. Are you sure you went into his lungs? 'Cause it looks like you're blowing up his stomach.
17373	Dr. Cox	Aw, dammit, his O2 sat's dropping. Get out of the way, honey; come on.
17374	J.D.'s Narration	Even if you've done a procedure five thousand times, there's no guarantee you won't screw up number five thousand, one.
17375	Dr. Cox	A few more seconds, we would have been coding this guy.
17376	Dr. Cox	Barbie, as hard as it is to remember, but _air_ goes in _the lungs_.
17377	J.D.	Can I practice my toast on you?
17378	Dr. Cox	No.
17379	J.D.	I'm opening with a quote from 'Spartacus'.

17381	J.D.	Actually it...goes a little lower.
17382	Turk	I don't know why Carla wants me to wear a cummerbund, let alone a red one.
17383	J.D.	Well, come on. As your best man, trust me, it's not about the style, it's about the fit. When you're out there on the dance floor, you don't want any restrictions, okay? Let's test these babies out one more time.
17384	Turk	Okay, ready? Five, six, seven, eight.
17385	Turk	And one, two, three, four, five six, seven, eight.
17386	J.D.	It _is_ hot!
17387	Turk	Put one hand on the floor!
17388	J.D.	I can't reach!
17389	Turk	You better feel the burn!
17390	J.D.	I can feel it burning!
17391	Tailor	Where I grew up, they didn't allow two men to marry.
17392	J.D.	Well, we grew up in ...
17393	Turk	Well, shoot, I grew up in the 'hood ...
17394	J.D.	...There you gotta do things like test suits out...
17395	Turk	...That's right.
17396	Turk	I'ma go change.
17397	J.D.	Uh.... I'm the best man. Do you have any advice for me to give my friend?
17398	Tailor	Just remind him over and over that the wedding is all about what the woman wants.
17399	J.D.	Yeah, I'll make sure and do that.
17400	Tailor	What did you have in mind?
17401	Priest	The ring, please?
17402	Turk	You got the ring?
17403	J.D.	It's got to be one of these!

17406	Carla	He's crashing. He needs to be intubated!
17407	Elliot	Dr. Cox!
17408	Dr. Cox	Oh, that's just dandy. I got a billion patients and no rooms, and I got Newbie pestering me for advice on how to be the best woman at Turtlehead's wedding, and I got a resident who can't do a simple procedure even though she learned it the first week she was here.
17409	Elliot	I'm sorry, Dr. Cox. I don't know what to do.
17410	Dr. Cox	I'll tell you what to do: Get the hell out of here.
17411	Dr. Cox	I swear to God, Carla, if one more annoying thing comes my way, please just go ahead and extract some of that extra air out of Barbie's head and inject it right into my veins!
17412	Dr. Kelso	Hey, ace! I want you to find my gardener, Hector, a room. He has a mild case of cellulitis, and I need him in tip-top shape by the weekend. I'm having my annual lawn-bowling tournament, and if anyone but Hector cuts my grass, my game goes to heck in a hand-basket.
17413	Dr. Cox	Dammit all, Bob, you know we don't have an extra bed in this dump!
17414	Dr. Kelso	Perry, what has two thumbs and still doesn't give a crap? Bob Kelso! I thought we'd met.
17415	Dr. Cox	Hector. Uh-heh. Cómo sea.
17416	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
17417	J.D.	Oh, man, this is amazing. I'm your best friend, now I'm your best man. What am I gonna be best at next?
17418	Turk	How about best at not talking?
17419	J.D.'s Thoughts	One one thousand, two one thousand.... And now I'm best at that!
17420	Janitor	Hey!
17421	J.D.	Me or him?
17422	Janitor	You.
17423	Turk	Cool.
17424	J.D.	What now?
17425	Janitor	Did you tell anybody about my epiphany toilet?
17426	J.D.	No, why?
17427	Janitor	Where're you coming from?
17428	Ted the Lawyer	Uhhh....
17429	Ted the Lawyer	...No...
17430	Ted the Lawyer	Hm?
17431	Janitor	If I find out you told anybody, I'm gonna beat you with poppy's old nickel sock.
17432	J.D.	First of all, why would I tell anyone? And secondly, no one has epiphanies on the john!
17433	Dr. Cox	Of course! It's so simple!
17434	Dr. Cox	Oh, Carla, good. Would you tell Hector here that he can stay just as long as he likes?
17435	Carla	Aye-aye, captain.
17436	Carla	Dice medigo...
17437	J.D.'s Narration	When two people collide, a lot of things can happen.
17438	Carla	...Okay?
17439	Dr. Kelso	What the hell is going on in here!?
17440	Dr. Cox	Oh, hey, Bob. Great news: we found Hector a room!
17441	J.D.'s Narration	For some it can be disaster.
17442	Elliot	I need help.
17443	Dr. Casey	Excuse me.
17444	Dr. Casey	Uh, buddy, can you not point that at me?
17445	Custodian	Sure.
17446	Dr. Casey	Hi. I'm Kevin.
17447	Elliot	I know!!! ...Um... I know.
17448	J.D.'s Narration	Still, the weirdest thing is when two people collide without ever being in the same room.
17449	Answering Machine	Hey, Turk, it's your brother. Good news! My business trip got canceled, so I can be your best man after all! I'm looking forward to it. Call me.
17450	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
17451	J.D.'s Narration	Sure I was hurt when I found out I was Turk's second choice for best man. But I'm not gonna be petty.... I mean, when the tux guy called to confirm Turk's measurements, I gave them to him.
17452	Turk	Dude! I look like I'm going to Ferrakhan day-camp!
17453	J.D.	Just paint your legs black, you'll be fine.
17454	Turk	Look at this lame-ass bow-tie and cummerbund, man!
17455	Tailor	Just remind him over and over that the wedding is all about what the woman wants.
17456	J.D.	You know what? You should totally say something. You know, unless you want to set a precedent where she's walking all over you for the rest of your life; but it's your call, you might love that, I don't know.
17457	Carla	I wanted those red cummerbunds because that's the theme!
17458	Turk	Red is a theme?
17459	Carla	Love is the theme! We're in love, you idiot!
17460	Carla	Just tell me why would you make such a big deal about something we both know you don't even care about?
17461	Turk	I don't know....
17462	J.D.	Well, I better get to work before all the good patients are taken.
17463	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
17464	Elliot	So tell me, is it harder being a surgeon or a doctor?
17465	Dr. Casey	Oh, definitely a surgeon. 'Cause when you tell people that a loved one died, you have to do that thing where you pull your surgical mask down and you shake your head. If you do it too fast, it says, you know, I knew he was gonna die. And if you take too long and pause with it, it gives 'em false hope. So you have to do it perfectly.
17466	Dr. Casey	"Ahh, damn."
17467	Elliot	If one of my loved ones ever dies...I hope it's because of you.
17468	Dr. Casey	Hey, me too.
17469	Elliot	Are we, uh, flirting?
17470	Dr. Casey	A little bit.
17471	Elliot	Awesome!
17472	Dr. Casey	Have you seen the roof toilet?
17473	Elliot	No. But I'm a nervous pooer.
17474	Dr. Casey	Okay, now we're definitely not flirting.
17475	Elliot	Oh, it's just that I'm a little more comfortable with the setup that I have at home, you know. Like...extra locks.
17476	Dr. Casey	Yeah, I've only gone outside my house twice. Once on an airplane, and once at the White House.
17477	Elliot	How are the bathrooms at the White House?
17478	Dr. Casey	I have no idea, but the fountains are nice. And security? Quick as bunnies.
17479	Elliot	Listen, Dr. Casey, um, I know that you've helped out a lot of people, and I've got this, uh, intubating problem.
17480	Dr. Casey	I'll be right back.
17481	Elliot	Where are you going?
17482	Dr. Casey	To climb a mountain.
17483	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
17484	Dr. Kelso	This is completely unacceptable!
17485	Carla	Well, you said find him a room!
17486	Dr. Kelso	Not my office, dammit!
17487	Dr. Cox	He's your gardener, for God's sake!
17488	Dr. Kelso	I could have both of you suspended...
17489	Dr. Cox	You made your own bed, now your underpaid gardener's gotta sleep in it!
17490	Dr. Kelso	Fine! Get out of here! I'll get some paperwork done!
17491	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
17492	Janitor	Oh, man. Tell me you're not waiting to use my roof toilet!
17493	Nurse Roberts	Well, I would use Dr. Kelso's like I normally do, but I don't wanna wake up Hector.
17494	Janitor	Okay, look, attention roof-poopers! Setting aside for a moment the fact that I'm gonna make sure that you all live to regret this day, let's keep the magic rolling let's not tell anyone else that there's a toilet on the roof.
17495	Janitor	There is not a toilet on the roof!
17496	Todd	But you just said there was.
17497	Janitor	No! Yes, I did, but I was using a metaphor...uhh...that means..."God is watching us." You've heard this, "There's a toilet on the roof."
17498	Janitor	Right? People?
17499	Nurse Roberts	That's right, ain't nothing up there.
17500	Todd	Cool.

17502	J.D.'s Thoughts	You know what, it's time to stop feeling sorry for yourself. You're still best man. It's not like Turk's gonna take that away from you.
17503	Turk	J.D., can I talk to you?
17504	J.D.'s Thoughts	AGH!
17505	Turk	Have you seen Carla around?
17506	J.D.	Phew! False alarm.
17507	Turk	'Cause I need to, uh, talk to you in private? Sort of man to man?
17508	J.D.'s Thoughts	AGH!
17509	J.D.	I can't right now, Turk. I am completely swamped.
17510	Turk	You're drawing lightning bolts on your Nikes.
17511	J.D.	So I can get to my patients faster.
17512	Turk	How 'bout later?
17513	J.D.	Later's no good, dude. I gotta stop by the tux shop, then I gotta finish telling my whole family that you picked me as your best man!
17514	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
17515	Elliot	This _is_ hard.
17516	Dr. Casey	I'm sorry it took me so long I had to go home. That damn roof toilet's got my number.
17517	Elliot	Can't lick it, huh?
17518	Dr. Casey	Oh, God, no! I can't even sit on it.
17519	Elliot	Look, um, that problem I was talking about before.... I can't seem to intubate patients anymore. I mean, I used to do that better than anyone here. Now the only thing that sets me apart from the other doctors is that my beeper plays "That's the way, uh-huh, uh-huh, I like it! Mm-hm, mm-hmm!" I don't know what to do.
17520	Dr. Casey	It's just a piece of porcelain! I mean, there's no reason we both shouldn't be able to sit on it!
17521	Elliot	Yeah, um, about my career-ending problem....
17522	Dr. Casey	We must conquer the roof toilet.
17523	Elliot	ENOUGH ABOUT THE ROOF TOILET! Listen, all I've heard about from everyone is how amazing you are, and I'm not leaving here until you help me out!
17524	Elliot	Dammit! I have to go.

17531	Carla	I'm sorry, Dr. Kelso, but I'm trying to get their lunch orders!
17532	Dr. Kelso	Oh, that reminds me. Hector, Enid made you a prosciutto and mozzarella sandwich, but I...uh...well, there was a misunderstanding and now it's gone.
17533	Hector	Espero no se la causando ningún problema a Dr. Kelso.

17537	Ted the Lawyer	I forget. Is "" "kill him" or "screw him"?

17541	J.D.	That's it! I just have to go and talk to him!
17542	Dr. Casey	...Kevin Casey.
17543	J.D.	Dr. Casey! Have you seen Turk?
17544	Dr. Casey	Oh, yeah, nice guy...good surgeon...great dancer.
17545	J.D.	You should see us gettin' down when we try pants on together.
17546	Dr. Casey	Yeah-heh. I have to go.
17547	J.D.	Cool. I'll see you tomorrow.
17548	Dr. Casey	Uh, actually, no. I got a call I have to go back to my hospital.
17549	J.D.	Why? Why do you have to do that?
17550	Dr. Casey	Well, look at it this way: Uh, I may be leaving here, but I will always be there.
17551	J.D.	I know.
17552	Dr. Casey	I am so messing with you.
17553	J.D.	Ha, I know.... Okay. Well, sir, it was amazing to work with you.
17554	Dr. Casey	Thank you.
17555	Dr. Casey	And that's three seconds!
17556	J.D.	Okay, sorry.
17557	Dr. Casey	Okay.
17558	J.D.'s Narration	Watching Kevin go, I wondered how gay I looked giving that two-handed handshake. And also how weird it was that someone could just walk into your life, have such a big impact, and then vanish just like that, never to be seen again.
17559	J.D.'s Narration	But mostly I thought about how, in some small way, Kevin had helped every single person he met here.

17564	Elliot	Kevin left. Didn't even say goodbye.
17565	J.D.	Elliot, he didn't say goodbye to a lot of people. Just me, Dr. Cox, Carla, Doug, Snoop Dogg Intern...
17566	Snoop Dogg Intern	Where my hos at?
17567	J.D.	I haven't seen them.
17568	Elliot	Look, I don't wanna sound pathetic, but, he didn't even help me.
17569	J.D.	He didn't help a lot of people, Elliot. It was just me, and Turk, and Carla, and Dr. Cox, and Doug, and Dr. Mickhead
17570	Elliot	Mickhead? No, Mickhead's in rehab.
17571	J.D.	_Was_ in rehab, Elliot. Was. He'll never huff paint again.
17572	Elliot	All right, see, with intubating....

17581	Dr. Kelso	Hector's wife just set my drapes on fire with her damn prayer candle!
17582	Carla	He's here!
17583	Dr. Kelso	I want them both out of my office!
17584	Carla	Sir, there's a ton of empty beds right here. All you have to do is flick the switch.
17585	Dr. Cox	You know how to do that, don't you, Bob? You just bend over...and flick.
17586	Dr. Cox	Yeah, I thought so.
17587	Elliot	Who took this?
17588	Turk	With Marbury, I really believe New York has a shot at the title, man.
17589	J.D.	Yeah, me too.
17590	Turk	Which sport are we talking about?
17591	J.D.	I wanna say tennis....
17592	Turk	The only reason I asked my brother to be best man was because I knew he couldn't come to the wedding. But now his plans have changed and he's all excited. Dude, it has to be you, you know that.
17593	J.D.'s Thoughts	It's always uncomfortable when two guys wanna say something each other.
17594	J.D.	Look, you've been my best friend for ten years, man; I've loved you since college, and you know I'd do anything for you.
17595	Turk	Dude, look, man, you're my friend and I frickin' love you; and no one's looked out for me like you have.
17596	Turk	Cool.
17597	J.D.	Solid.
17598	J.D.	You know, if it makes it easier, I guess we could be co-best men.
17599	Turk	You have no idea how much stress that would relieve.
17600	J.D.	...Even though...God said it's supposed to be one....
17601	Carla	You ever think there's more to Dr. Kelso than we know?
17602	Dr. Cox	Sure, is he in fact a latex-encased robot with real human hair and a circuit board where his heart should be? I can't...I can't rule that out.
17603	Carla	You know, Hector told me he's worked for Dr. Kelso for twenty years. That's half his life. I mean, I know he looks 50, but that's what being in the sun all day does to your skin.
17604	Dr. Cox	Right, right.
17605	Carla	The point is, it doesn't seem like he hates Dr. Kelso.
17606	Dr. Cox	Say...Say, Bobbo...
17607	Dr. Cox	Is it possible that you're occasionally a decent human being in your life outside of this place?
17608	Dr. Kelso	Well, champ, seeing as you don't exist in my life outside this place, I doubt it's any of your damn business.
17609	Paramedic	Go! Let's go, let's go!
17610	Elliot	Uh, hi. We don't have a helicopter pad
17611	Paramedic	We're out of time! He's losing oxygen, he needs to be intubated now!
17612	Elliot	Okay, just let me get someone.
17613	Paramedic	NOW! You! Let's go! Do it!
17614	Paramedic	Come on!
17615	Elliot	I'm in.
17616	Dr. Casey	You see, this is why I wanted you to use the bathroom up here.
17617	Dr. Casey	If there's something you know you can do, whether it's intubating a patient or...copping a squat on the roof, and your mind keeps throwing up roadblocks, just know you can drive right through 'em.
17618	J.D.	I can't believe it's gone.
17619	J.D.'s Narration	I think it's human nature to search for answers.
17620	Turk	Dude. Why is your tux gonna cost four thousand dollars?
17621	J.D.	No reason.
17622	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes the answer you get is the one you least expect.
17623	Dr. Kelso	All right, pipe down! Now, who's up for Dairy Queen?
17624	Hector & Family	Dairy Queen!
17625	J.D.'s Narration	But more often than not, the answers we've been looking for have been inside us all along.
17626	Dr. Cox	Well done, there, Barbie. You're now exactly where you were three years ago.
17627	J.D.'s Narration	I guess the important thing is to never stop searching.

17659	J.D.	It was a gift.

17661	Jordan	Anyhoo. I'm thinking that you probably shouldn't come.
17662	J.D.	Why not?

17675	J.D.	So, is their brother Ben coming to this thing too?
17676	Cox	Oh yeah. He always has to make some grand entrance that he just winds up depressed

17727	J.D.	Dr. Cox, I can't. I'm already covering for Doug. He's on a His-and-Her Spa Day with
17728	&	WHAT?!
17729	J.D.	Don't ask. The point is, I'm swamped. And I'm a little worried about Mr. Taylor here.
17730	J.D.	Mr. Taylor.
17731	Cox	Hiiiiii.
17732	J.D.	For the life of me, I can't figure out his irregular heartbeat.
17733	Cox	I already looked at his EKG, Newbie, and trust me. He's not gonna die in the next
17734	Ben	Hey, J.D. My sister Danni is more of a gentle kisser, don't you think? But I find
17735	J.D.	Would you please stop it.
17736	Ben	Fangs.
17737	Carla	This guy is supposed to be a great plastic surgeon.
17738	Plastic Surgeon	Okaaaaaaaaaaaay. So who wants what bigger or smaller?
17739	Carla	My fiancé would like to have his mole removed.
17740	Plastic Surgeon	That? That's cute. It's like a tickle button.
17741	Turk	No, it's not. It needs to go away.
17742	Plastic Surgeon	All right. I'll scrap it away and we'll cover it with skin from the
17743	J.D.	So you would be a butt-face.
17744	Elliot	That would be a funny nickname.
17745	Turk	No, it wouldn't.
17746	J.D.	God, how long does it
17747	Turk	Watch, I'm going to get out of this mole thing.
17748	Elliot	Whatever, Butt-face.
17749	Turk	Uncool.
17750	Ted	Sir, I think I figured out how my problem affects one of your loved ones. It affects me.
17751	Kelso	Swing and a miss. <Holding his cake, he turns his chair around to face the table
17752	Carla	Oh, thank God you're here. I totally need someone to talk to.
17753	Carla	Usually I would talk to Dr. Cox, but he's out doing stuff. 'Course, there is always
17754	Kelso	As do I.
17755	Carla	See, it's just that I told Turk I didn't like his mole,
17756	Kelso	You've seen it, you can't avoid it.
17757	Ted	Dr. Cox. Ah. I'm afraid my band lost a member. So we're not going to be able to
17758	Cox	Ted. Now, even though I never asked you to, that is still just ter-rific news.
17759	Ted	That hurt here,
17760	J.D.	Dr. Cox.
17761	Cox	What's the matter with you there,
17762	J.D.	Twenty minutes after you left, he went into cardiac arrest.
17763	Ben	Whoa, man. Bummer.
17764	Cox	This shouldn't have happened.
17765	J.D. Thoughts	Guilt's a funny thing. It can lead to denial.
17766	Cox	Kid screwed up.
17767	Ben	No, he didn't. He told you he has way too many patients, he's swamped.
17768	Cox	The kid screwed up.
17769	Ben	Darn kid!
17770	J.D. Thoughts	Guilt can lead to compromise.
17771	Carla	Turk is doing this sweet thing for me, you know?
17772	Kelso	Men's room!
17773	Bathroom occupants	Whoa! Hey!
17774	Carla	I just wish there was something I could do for him.
17775	Turk	Know what, sweetie? I'm fine with getting rid of this mole. But you got to be willing to take my last name when we get
17776	Carla	That's perfect. Of course I will.
17777	Elliot	And there she goes. Mrs. Carla Butt-face.
17778	Turk	Dammit.
17779	J.D. Thoughts	But as a doctor, you are around death so much, you get used to the guilt. And
17780	Ben	Brace yourself.
17781	Cox	What are you still doing here?
17782	J.D.	I'm on call tonight.
17783	Cox	Not anymore. I'm taking all your patients.
17784	J.D.	So wait. You think this was my fault?
17785	Ben	Hey, this is an emotional situation. So why don't you go easy on the kid?
17786	Cox	It was your fault. Now get the hell out.
17787	Ben	Well, that was good. That was good listening.
17788	Cox	Kev.
17789	Ben	Yup.

17794	Cox	I got it. I got it.
17795	Scruffy	Thanks, man.
17796	Carla	Hey. You've been here for sixty straight hours. You need to go home.
17797	Cox	You know what I need. I need people to stop telling me what I should do.
17798	Carla	Fine.
17799	Ben	You know what you should do?
17800	Cox	Aw. Why are you here?
17801	J.D.	Dr. Cox. Can I talk to you for a second?
17802	J.D.	Look. You want to be mad at me, that's fine. I get it. Okay. But Jordan called. And
17803	Ben	Oh. Right. That thing. Put us down for Ben plus one.
17804	Cox	I'm not going anywhere. So beat it.
17805	Turk	You guys, I don't want to do this.
17806	Elliot	Come on. No one's going to call you names.
17807	Turk	I know, but...
17808	Turk	Listen. My butt is fabulous. A slice of that up here,
17809	J.D.	I can't, man. I got things to do.

17815	Turk	Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
17816	Elliot	Oh right. Yeah.
17817	Turk	Thank you. I hate her for doing this to me.
17818	Carla	I hate him for doing this to me.
17819	Carla	I don't think he understands that Espinosa is more than a name to me. It's my

17823	Ben	Can we go now?
17824	Cox	No.
17825	Ben	How about now?
17826	Cox	No. Look, as a rule of thumb, I don't attend parties where the guest of honor has no
17827	Ben	That's not true. Remember back when you and Jordan first got married, and we went to
17828	Cox	Benny, I appreciate your concern, but you just don't understand.
17829	Ben	What don't I understand?
17830	Cox	Well, do you see all these people here? This is not some kind of senior citizens
17831	Ben	If I'm not here, people die.
17832	Cox	Come on!
17833	Ben	And that way, you can piss off for the afternoon, and
17834	Cox	So you haven't noticed that my supporting cast in this theater of hell is a veritable
17835	Elliot	for Carla. And honestly, it is like she has gone poof! And like disappeared into thin

17837	Cox	No. I haven't seen her.
17838	Cox	Oh, Ben. Outstanding commitment.
17839	Ben	Thanks. So, can we go now?
17840	Cox	Provided that gets you off my back.
17841	Cox	Oh, come on.
17842	Ben	You got to forgive him.
17843	J.D.	What? They're my shower shorts.
17844	Lobby	Elliot and the Janitor are walking. She convinced the Janitor to help her track
17845	Elliot	Thanks again for helping me look for Carla.
17846	Janitor	No problem. I'll check the dumpster.
17847	Elliot	Ah, we're not looking for dead Carla.
17848	Janitor	That-a-girl. You stay optimistic.
17849	Carla	Ahem. Sorry, sir. It's been an emotional couple of days.
17850	Kelso	I'm just here to, ah,
17851	Carla	I just wish I didn't hate that mole so
17852	Carla	Thank you, sir.
17853	Turk	All right, I'm gonna get right down to it. You tell Carla that
17854	Carla	Turk! I don't want you to do this!
17855	Plastic Surgeon	The mole's inoperable.
17856	Turk	Ow!
17857	Turk	Don't sweat it.
17858	Turk	See ya!
17859	Plastic Surgeon	<Miffed at losing the 10 K) Great, an open surgery slot just gone to waste.
17860	Elliot	Not necessarily.
17861	Elliot	Look at this.
17862	Plastic Surgeon	Waugh!
17863	Elliot	Oh.
17864	Cox	Those are the most ridiculous things I have ever seen.
17865	J.D.	You know, you're right. I was an idiot to buy these shower shorts. I mean, it's not like
17866	Cox	Look, I just want to say. That what happened. Wasn't your fault. And I'm
17867	J.D.	Thanks. I really needed to hear that.
17868	Ben	Good. Fun. Let's get dressed and go.
17869	Cox	Shower Shortz?
17870	J.D.	For the man who has nothing to hide. But still wants
17871	J.D. Thoughts	Acceptance can take a lot of different forms.

17876	J.D. Thoughts	...or accepting someone you love for just the way they are.
17877	Turk	Can you tie my tie, Mrs. Espinosa?
17878	Turk's mole	Answer him!
17879	Turk	You just kissed my mole.
17880	Carla	Mmm-hmm.
17881	Cox	So how come you don't have to get all dressed up?
17882	Ben	I am dressed up. You see any holes in these pants?
17883	Cox	No.
17884	Ben	I'm glad you made it. Listen. There is one more thing you have to do for me.
17885	Cox	You can't keep me from getting drunk.
17886	Ben	You have to forgive yourself for everything that went down the other day.
17887	Ben	Yeah.
17888	Cox	Okay.
17889	Ben	Good.
17890	Cox	Now, where is your camera? Aren't, aren't you going to take some pictures?
17891	J.D.	Pictures of what?
17892	Cox	You know. Crying babies. Covered in chocolate. People singing
17893	J.D.	Where do you think we are?

17896	J.D.'s Narration	It's been two weeks since Ben's death, and even though he was Jordan's brother, Dr. Cox was having a much harder time with it than she was.
17897	Jordan	Sweetie, are you gonna lie around on the couch all day again today?
17898	Dr. Cox	What am I supposed to do?
17899	Jordan	You know what might be fun? Cleaning yourself.
17900	Dr. Cox	I'd wash up, but I'm afraid to go in our bathroom.
17901	Jordan	Why?
17902	J.D.'s Narration	Jordan's best friends came to town for the funeral, and unfortunately for Dr. Cox, they still haven't left.
17903	Maddie	Since Perry won't stop using the loo without lifting the seat, I've started to use his sink.
17904	Jordan	Aren't you a little dolled up for the movies?
17905	Allison	If little miss co-dependent here doesn't get "shagged" every two days, she gets the shakes.
17906	Maddie	It's true. Look.
17907	Dr. Cox	'Course, that could be 'cause you're sober for a change.
17908	Maddie	Maybe!
17909	Dr. Cox	Mmm!
17910	Allison	You silly. Are you still mad because we tried to fix Jordan up with someone yesterday?
17911	Allison	Scary!
17912	Dr. Cox	Oh, God.
17913	J.D.'s Narration	Dr. Kelso was having a little female trouble of his own.
17914	Carla	Dr. Kelso, the sexual harassment around here has gotten out of control. Yesterday somebody asked Laverne if her boobs were made for walking! It's rude! ...And it makes no sense.
17915	Nurse Roberts	Paris and Nikki were not amused.
17916	Carla	You named your breasts after the Hilton sisters?
17917	Nurse Roberts	Other way around, sugar!
17918	Ted the Lawyer	Ladies, this hospital's policy on sexual harassment is well-established. Plus
17919	Dr. Kelso	I'll handle this. I think what Garfunkle here is trying to say is that you should all take a second, think seriously about what's really bothering you, and then have a big group unbunching of your panties.
17920	J.D.'s Narration	Every time Turk's in a hurry, I'm always tempted to jump out and scare him. Well, today's the day!
17921	J.D.	Booga! Booga! Booga! Booga!
17922	J.D.	Wooo! Ack!
17923	J.D.'s Narration	The...reason Turk's in such a rush is because he's starting a rotation with the hospital's new attending surgeon.
17924	Dr. Miller	So.... You guys my new residents?
17925	J.D.'s Narration	I could tell what the guys were thinking.
17926	Dr. Miller	Oh! There's so much blood! I hope it doesn't get on my dress!
17927	Dr. Miller	I'm Dr. Miller. A few quick things: Don't talk while I'm talking, never utter the phrase "It's Miller time", and I don't like the smell of cologne in my operating room. Now, I'd like to take a minute to listen to any questions or comments that any of you might have, and then after this minute I never want to hear from any of you ever, ever, ever again. Anyone?
17928	Turk	Uh...I'm allergic to shellfish...?
17929	Dr. Miller	Any other allergies? No? Great! You, and unibrow, go scrub up.
17930	Turk	Wht?
17931	Todd	My waxer's in the Bahamas.
17932	Turk	Get a new one!

17934	Jordan	Okay, why don't you show the girls around while I'm in my board meeting.
17935	Dr. Cox	Love to. Newbie? I've got a job for you.
17936	Jordan	No, no. No pawning them off on Radar. They want the big-boy tour.
17937	Allison	Hey, I've been sharing a guest room with razor-knees, here, for the last two weeks. Do you have a queen bed?
17938	J.D.	Well, it would be "queen" if I took my "cwothes" off it.
17939	Maddie	Ooh, he's quick. What's he like in the sack?
17940	Jordan	Quicker.
17941	Allison	Oh.
17942	J.D.	May I be excused?
17943	Dr. Cox	You move, you die!
17944	Jordan	Be nice to my friends. Bye.
17945	Allison	Bye.
17946	Jordan	Bye.
17947	Dr. Cox	Okay! Here's the tour: This is where the patients enter, upstairs is where they go to die, and down in the basement is where we slide their cold, dead bodies into the wall. Oh, and that's the gift shop.
17948	Maddie	Where can one get a nice gin and tonic?
17949	J.D.	You know, down the street on the right, they'll make an appletini that'll knock your socks off.
17950	Maddie	Right! Let's go and get drunk before pilates!
17951	J.D.	So, uh, Jordan seems to be doing pretty well.
17952	Dr. Cox	You know Jordan, she is a rock.
17953	J.D.	How 'bout you? How you holding up?
17954	J.D.	I...I know it's been kind of tough with Ben dying.
17955	J.D.	Are you gonna talk ever?
17956	Dr. Cox	Let me go ahead and tee this up for you, there, Annika: We are all going to die someday. For the lucky few of us it'll be nice and fast. But for most of us it'll be just as long and slow and painful as a conversation with you.
17957	J.D.	That's a beautiful sentiment.

17961	Todd	Over there!
17962	Turk	Todd. Todd, let's get off on the right foot.
17963	Dr. Miller	Hey! It might just be 'cause my expectations are low, but you guys did not suck in surgery yesterday.
17964	Todd	Well, as long as your expectations are low, maybe we should have sex!
17965	Turk	Perfect.
17966	Dr. Miller	I'm concerned about you. I think you hold us women responsible for the fact that your mommy didn't pay attention to you, and if you don't get help, you'll eventually start picking up prostitutes and killing them.
17967	Elliot	I've always wanted to say that to him!
17968	Dr. Miller	Welp, now you don't have to! Ha-ha-ha!
17969	Todd	She just talked to me like I'm an idiot.

17974	Dr. Kelso	Nurse Espinosa, it's been brought to my attention that there's been some inappropriate behavior lately.
17975	Carla	I know. _I_ brought it to your attention.
17976	Dr. Kelso	Anyway, it occurred to me that we can't allow this to continue.
17977	Ted the Lawyer	It occurred to _you_ because _I_ researched case studies detailing the hospital's liability instead of going to single's night at the Korean church by my house!
17978	Dr. Kelso	Ted's sad life aside, I have decided that you are going to run a sexual harassment seminar.
17979	Carla	No one's gonna show up for that!
17980	Dr. Kelso	It isn't optional. Anyone gets more than three complaints here in the box
17981	Dr. Kelso	then they have to attend.

17990	J.D.	I wrote Dear Abby once in seventh grade 'cause I didn't have body hair like the other guys? By the time her response came out in Parade magazine, it was like a forest down there. Well, you know, "nothing ventured..."
17991	Dr. Cox	Looking for streamers and a and a marching band, because this will be the ceremonial one-millionth time I've had to shake off something that you've said.
17992	Dr. Cox	Ahh. Yes, Newbie, I'm having a tough day. And of course I'd love to head home, but Jordan's satanic brood has taken over my apartment and no man in his right mind would dare enter that place.

17999	Todd	High-five later for reading my mind!
18000	Turk	You know, I don't think you're stupid, Todd.... Even though you're washing your hands with your gloves already on.
18001	Todd	Dammit!
18002	Turk	But keep your mouth shut, okay?
18003	Turk	It's hard for Dr. Miller being a female surgeon around here.

18009	Maddie	Just a second, darling.
18010	J.D.	Uhhh, um.
18011	Maddie	Of course, we will leave, but before we go, Allie could really use a man's opinion.
18012	Allison	Does this bra make my boobs look real?
18013	J.D.	Ohh, yes.
18014	Allison	Damn. Let's switch.
18015	J.D.	No, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no switchies. I think we should all be happy with the bras God gave us! I really should go.
18016	Maddie	Oh, it's all right. We were going to go to the gym, but I could just as easily throw up instead.
18017	Allison	Or you could just give us a work-out right here.
18018	J.D.	Uhh....
18019	J.D.	I guess I could hang for a smidge.
18020	Maddie	Good. 'Cause we've got something to tell you. Right, Allie?

18042	Dr. Miller	You know what's worse than the basic knuckle-dragging scalpel jocks I usually work with? You. You are the worst kind of sexist. You're one of the sneaky ones who prides himself on saying all the right things when, deep down, what you really think is that I'm just a little girl who needs protecting.

18050	Jordan	Huh.
18051	J.D.	Oh, God.
18052	J.D.'s Narration	And misunderstandings, well, they can lead to disaster.
18053	Dr. Miller	Dr. Turk? I asked you to apologize.
18054	Turk	I have nothing to apologize for.
18055	Dr. Miller	Then get out of my O.R.
18056	Dr. Miller	Awww.... Are you gonna cry like a little boy? See how I flipped it?
18057	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18058	Turk	Dr. Miller accused me of being sexist. Me! I'm marrying Carla who do you think wears the pants? And the shirts...and the shoes...and sometimes my underwear.
18059	Elliot	Really?
18060	Turk	I said nothing.
18061	Nurse Roberts	Mr. Roberts likes to wear my brassieres.
18062	Elliot	Hm?
18063	Turk	Elliot, this woman doesn't like me. It could keep me from becoming the youngest chief of surgery in history, which could keep me from curing paralysis, which could keep me from having my birthday be a national holiday! And everyone knows I hate to work on my birthday!
18064	Dr. Cox	May I ask you something, there, Judy? Do you have any idea what it's like to have three angry, under-fed women tear you several new ones for a full hour?
18065	J.D.	Actually, yes. I caught the matinee of that show; definitely not for the whole family.
18066	Dr. Cox	Then for the last time, don't stick any part of your hairless body into my business. Trust me, there is nothing for you to gain from it. Because even if you went on a cruise to the most remote regions of the ocean and rescued my drowning, salt-soaked body in time to pump the sea water out of my lungs and bring me back from the brink of death, I would STILL be upset that the first face I saw was yours!
18067	J.D.	Well, you wouldn't see my face because it would be buried in your chest, giving you the hug you've been afraid to ask for your whole life!
18068	Dr. Cox	Huh!
18069	J.D.	Now, if you don't want my help, then fine, I'll back off.... But only because I feel a little bit guilty.
18070	Dr. Cox	About what?
18071	Dr. Cox	Uh?
18072	Ted the Lawyer	Dr. Cox, you received four complaints about calling male residents by girl's names.
18073	Dr. Cox	Oh-ho. JUDY!
18074	Dr. Cox	Oh, you come here, Judy!
18075	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18076	Dr. Cox	Well done, there, Bobbo. When my patients ask me where I was all afternoon, I'll just tell them I was too busy attending this ridiculous chat-fest with you and Dr. What's-He-Over-Compensating-For? here.
18077	Carla	Did I say any of you boys could talk? No, I did not.
18078	Carla	Now, this part is especially important, so I need everyone's full attention.
18079	Dr. Cox	You come here, you rat-bastard!
18080	Carla	Awesome!
18081	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18082	Elliot	Dr. Miller, hi!
18083	Dr. Miller	Thanks! My patient just died, but if I'm looking good, I'm psyched!
18084	Elliot	No, no. It's just that you work in a very tough specialty, and you manage to maintain your femininity and I find that very...um...sexy.
18085	Dr. Miller	Are you asking me out on a date?
18086	Elliot	Please! We just met! ...Not that it would make a difference if we hadn't...um....
18087	Dr. Miller	Uggh.
18088	Elliot	and he is not a sexist. And I know sexist. I mean, when my dad's not asking the maid for a neck-rub, he's telling me if I'm going to get emotional, I should do it in a closet because no one likes to see a hysterical woman.
18089	Dr. Miller	There's a closet right there!
18090	Elliot	I know, it's one of my favorites....
18091	Dr. Miller	Dr. Reid! I've seen you strutting around this place with your can-do attitude, and I know that you think because you're a female doctor, you're part of the solution. But you're not. Everything about you screams, "What does the cutie in Radiology think about me?" And yes, your friend Dr. Turk, he may ask you relationship advice or where to get his unfortunate girlfriend some naughty lingerie because we both know that when it comes to gifts, women all crave a nice leather push-up bra with tassels that go around and around and around like this but still, I ask you, is that _respect_?
18092	Dr. Miller	Uh, don't answer. I don't care!
18093	J.D.	Aaaaaaaaagggggggghhhhhhh!
18094	Dr. Cox	Move, Barbie! Move! Barbie!
18095	J.D.'s Thoughts	Yes! He fell! I'm gonna get away!
18096	J.D.	Ook! Waaagh!
18097	Janitor	You lookin' for that?
18098	Dr. Cox	Like you read about.
18099	Dr. Cox	Come here, you.
18100	J.D.	Ack!
18101	Dr. Cox	Come on!
18102	J.D.	Well, uh....
18103	Dr. Cox	Spill.
18104	J.D.	Dr. Cox had nothing to do with me going to see your scary friends. I did it all on my own.
18105	Jordan	I love how adult our relationship is!
18106	Dr. Cox	Fine. You want some straight shootin'? I'm glad that you're dealing with Ben's death so well. The fact is I'm strugglin'. And having those two harpies nesting in our home is not helping. For the life of me, Jordan, I cannot figure out why they're still here. It is beyond me!
18107	J.D.	You okay?
18108	Jordan	Why don't you grow a pair, Sally!
18109	J.D.	Oh, oka that's going in the box. Girl's names are out. That's why we have a box.
18110	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18111	Turk	Well?
18112	Elliot	I hate to quote my mother, but Dr. Miller is so uptight she could use a pitcher of martinis and an afternoon on top of a smooth-chested pool-boy.
18113	Turk	I knew you'd hate her.
18114	Elliot	I love her! Turk, do you know what I would give to have a female attending like her pushing me not to let the fact that I'm a woman hold me back? I mean...you have no idea how hard it is.
18115	Turk	_I_ have no idea?
18116	Elliot	Look, I'm not gonna fight about whether in medicine it's harder being black or a woman.
18117	Turk	Black!
18118	Elliot	Woman!
18119	Turk	Much prop, Dr. Rhodes.
18120	Elliot	Mm.
18121	Turk	Go get 'em.
18122	Elliot	Turk, let me ask you one question. Gun to your head, who do you think make better doctors, men or women?
18123	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18124	Carla	Nooooooo, Todd. The term "melons" _is_ just as bad as "sweater meat."
18125	Todd	Well then I am thoroughly confused!
18126	Carla	This is a total waste of time!
18127	Dr. Cox	And do you know why it's a total waste of time?
18128	Dr. Cox	Well, now, take Bobbo, here. He's just a product of a different era!
18129	Dr. Kelso	Foxy, Enid!
18130	Enid	Oh!
18131	Dr. Kelso	Hot mama.
18132	Dr. Kelso	Those were the days.
18133	Dr. Cox	And...this one. God save me, I can't even imagine what that upbringing must have been like.
18134	Todd's Dad	Boy, I'd like to take a swig out of her jugs.
18135	Todd's Dad	Hey, I'm talking, numb-nuts!
18136	Todd	Dad! I'm listening to 'Annie'!
18137	Todd	It _is_ a hard-knock life.
18138	Dr. Cox	My point is that in this tight-ass PC culture, it is damn hard to know what's kosher!
18139	Carla	Well, then you should try stepping into our shoes! Even the strongest women walk around with this thick coat of armor all day long, because God forbid we should show the slightest sign of weakness. So just squeeze those smelly, oversized feet into the shoes of someone you really care about; and trust me, in a heartbeat you will know the right thing to do.
18140	J.D.'s Narration	At that moment, Dr. Cox knew why Jordan's friends were still around.
18141	Jordan	Oh, would you turn off the lights? The baby doesn't know I'm here.
18142	Jordan	Doesn't matter. Likes the nanny better than me anyway.
18143	Dr. Cox	Me too.
18144	Jordan	I miss Ben.
18145	Dr. Cox	Me too. God, me too.
18146	Turk	You want me to help you move that table?
18147	Turk	Not that you can't move it!
18148	Dr. Miller	What do you want, Dr. Turk?
18149	Turk	I was just thinking about...you know, what you were saying when I said that thing, and
18150	Dr. Miller	Just say it.
18151	Turk	...I'm sorry.
18152	Dr. Miller	Scrub up.
18153	Turk	So we're cool?
18154	Dr. Miller	-Ish. But you're a decent surgeon, and uh, I'm not one to be petty. So why don't we put on a little music?
18155	Turk	Yes. Why don't we.
18156	J.D.'s Narration	There will always be a battle for power between the sexes.
18157	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes a man just has to give in.
18158	Todd	Gotta grab those.
18159	Dr. Kelso	No!
18160	Staffer	Ugh!
18161	Dr. Kelso	Remember, we look...but we don't touch.
18162	Todd	Okay.
18163	J.D.'s Narration	Other times it's enough just to take a positive step.
18164	J.D.'s Narration	And once in a while, even it seems cliché, a man just has to be there for her.
18165	Dr. Cox	You know, honey, I'm I'm here now, if you if you want your friends to leave.
18166	Jordan	We're getting chemical peels tomorrow.
18167	Dr. Cox	Oh. Okay.
18168	Dr. Cox	Oh...guh.
18169	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18170	Dr. Cox	Look, Carol, I know you think you look dashing in your navy blue scrubs, but I can't deal with the fact that I walk into the front door of this place and I find you standing there taaaalking at me.
18171	J.D.	All I said was "good morning".
18172	Dr. Cox	Exactly! And who in God's name wants to hear that every day?! "Good morning." In the immortal words of Daffy Duck: I demand that you shoot me now.
18173	Dr. Cox	If only.
18174	J.D.'s Narration	I couldn't help but think two things. First, I do look stunning in these navy scrubs I mean, come on, who wants a taste? Second, everyone's day begins differently around here.
18175	J.D.'s Narration	The surgeons for instance are the most superstitious bunch. So they always start their mornings with an oddly homo-erotic ass slap...
18176	Turk	Dude! Too deep!
18177	J.D.'s Narration	...and then their own personal good luck rituals.
18178	Turk	Ohhh, where's my lucky Tabasco 'do-rag!?
18179	J.D.	Why don't you just use Power Rangers?
18180	Turk	How are Power Rangers as lucky as Tabasco?
18181	J.D.	You remember when communications with Zordon went down and the Megazord was destroyed?
18182	Turk	How did I miss that episode? Ohh, that's right I was making love to a woman.
18183	J.D.	Power Rangers, hoooaaa!
18184	J.D.'s Narration	All you can really hope is that nothing bites you on the ass.
18185	Elliot	Gaby, you all set for your bone marrow transplant today?
18186	Gaby	I'm scared. I wanted to bring my stuffed pink doggie with me, but Mean Nurse says I can't.
18187	Elliot	Well, I promise you you'll have it.
18188	Elliot	Honestly, _Mean Nurse_, why would you say that?
18189	Carla	Because she lost her stuffed pink doggie two days ago.
18190	Elliot	Frick!
18191	Turk	Since I been wearing that Tabasco 'do-rag, my surgery record's like 23 and 0.
18192	J.D.	Are you counting the boil you lanced yesterday?
18193	Turk	Question: Did he die? Answer: No, he did not. The point is, I gotta stick with whatever's hot. Like last month, it was not wearing any underwear.
18194	J.D.	So why don't you just take off your underwear?
18195	Todd	That's what I keep telling him!
18196	J.D.	Todd knows about the underwear thing?
18197	Turk	No.
18198	Todd	Oh, yeah.
18199	Turk	Look, the 'do-rag still has the juice, okay? I mean, can you imagine what could happen without it?
18200	Turk	I can't find any kind of obstruction!
18201	Dr. Wen	Keep looking. It must be there!
18202	Turk	I felt it!
18203	J.D.	Powerful, tiny fists....
18204	Turk	Hm!
18205	J.D.	He's back.
18206	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18207	J.D.'s Narration	Some people say everything comes down to luck....
18208	Turk	I need my lucky 'do-rag!
18209	J.D.'s Narration	What I believe is that the most minor event even a butterfly flapping its wings can affect everything.
18210	Turk	Hillside landing.
18211	J.D.'s Narration	Because once that seemingly insignificant event happens....
18212	Carla	What is wrong with you!?
18213	Turk	Baby, I wasn't looking at her lovelies. Okay? I was looking at the butterfly that just happened to _land_ on her lovelies. And who could blame it? There they are, all snuggly and safe and whatnot....
18214	J.D.'s Narration	...It sets everything else in motion.
18215	J.D.	Uncomfortable!
18216	Janitor	Okay, who do I kill?
18217	J.D.	She did it!
18218	Janitor	Man, I don't wanna clean this up!
18219	Nurse Roberts	Well, then, I think you picked the wrong day to be the janitor.
18220	Turk	Oh!
18221	Elliot	Janitor? Could you help me find a little girl's pink stuffed doggie?
18222	Janitor	I would love to, Darlin', but I'm a little bit busy right now.
18223	J.D.'s Narration	And insignificant events can lead to significant events.
18224	J.D.'s Narration	Like me being on time and Dr. Cox being late for a change.
18225	Dr. Kelso	Where the hell is Dr. Cox? His shift started four minutes ago!
18226	J.D.'s Thoughts	Uh-oh. You've gotta cover for him.
18227	J.D.	Have to learn to play the banjo.
18228	Dr. Kelso	Dammit, son, are you listening to me?
18229	J.D.	Yes, sir!
18230	J.D.'s Thoughts	And _buy_ a banjo.
18231	Dr. Cox	Hey, fellas. What'd I miss?
18232	J.D.'s Thoughts	And here he is!
18233	Dr. Cox	Goodness gracious. Suddenly I'm getting the most intense headache.
18234	Dr. Cox	Better. Worse. Better. Worse. I could do this all day!
18235	Dr. Kelso	You know, Perry, since Dr. Dorian was on time and you were busy in the break room coming up with that hilarious "better-worse" bit, maybe you should answer to him all day.
18236	J.D.	Uh, Dr. Kelso? That's my pen.
18237	Dr. Cox	Nice grab.
18238	J.D.	Well, I'm a lefty.
18239	Dr. Cox	You know, my head's probably going to melt when I say this but Kelso's idea wasn't half bad. Letting you run this place for a day would be a great educational experience. And, come on, let's face facts the training bra's got to come off eventually. So, it's your show, Debbie. Is this moment just the way you always pictured it?
18240	J.D.	It's your show, Debbie. Is this moment just like you always pictured?
18241	J.D.	Stupid homemade dolls....
18242	J.D.	It's a little bigger...?
18243	Dr. Cox	Ehhhhh.
18244	Carla	Turk, I just got off of a 12-hour shift. I'm starving and I have yet to take a single bathroom break which, by the way, is why I'm dancing a little and you want me to run home, search through your nasties, and bring back your lucky 'do-rag?
18245	Turk	And if you could be back in twenty minutes that'd be great.
18246	Dr. Kelso	Nurse Espinosa, your shift ended nine minutes ago. How is it that your time card isn't punched out?
18247	Carla	Well, sir, I
18248	Turk	Dr. Kelso, how is it that you had an ambulance take you to your dinner reservation last night just so you wouldn't lose it?
18249	Dr. Kelso	How do you know that?
18250	Turk	Because I'm the "homeboy" you screamed at to get my "ghettomobile" off the road.
18251	Carla	Turk! I don't need you to fight my battles for me. It makes me look like I can't defend myself!
18252	Turk	You're absolutely right, baby. And I apologize! Remember! 'Do-rag!
18253	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18254	Carla	Huh!
18255	Carla	Hello?
18256	Elliot	Hey, it's Elliot. What are you doing?
18257	Carla	Nothing disgusting.
18258	Elliot	I can't find that girl's little pink doggie anywhere.
18259	Todd	I got a pink doggie for you but it is not little.
18260	Elliot	Look, if you show me your penis, I'm gonna take it away from you.
18261	Todd	Cool.
18262	Elliot	Yeah, that was Todd.
18263	Carla	Don't worry about the doggie. I'll be right there.
18264	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18265	Mr. Strauss	Basically, I've had nausea and stomach pains for a couple of days now.
18266	J.D.	Mr. Strauss, I don't wanna tell you how to live your life, but maybe you should avoid eating sushi from the Gas 'n' Go.
18267	Patient	It came free with the fill-up! What am I supposed to do, just throw it away?
18268	Dr. Cox	Yes. Yes, you are. Fortunately, though, your vitals are normal, so we'll check back with you in a little while.
18269	J.D.	Sounds to me like a G.I. bleed.
18270	Dr. Cox	Sounds to me like angina.
18271	Look, Newbie, if you leave this hospital knowing only one thing and, God save me, it seems like there's a pretty good chance that just might happen let that one thing be this	that medicine is a collaborative effort. And that means that your opinion is just as important as mine. So, let's see if you got the gobstoppers to take the lead. Be me!
18272	J.D.'s Thoughts	Come on...you can do this. Navy scrubs! Navy scrubs! Navy scrubs!
18273	J.D.	Hhhheeeere's the deal, Eleanor: We're gonna go ahead and get a full work-up on this guy. So, while I drop an NG tube and do a gastric lavage, why don't you go ahead and get an order on EKG with cardio biomarkers. If you need to know where those are, they're on page 37 of the Ann Taylor catalog right next to that salmon cable-knit sweater you've wanted for so long but haven't had the courage to order...'cause you're worried the weave's so thin, your nipples might just go ahead and peek their little pink selves through. Isn't that right, Dr. Cox.
18274	J.D.	...Dr. Cox...
18275	Dr. Cox	Oh, I-I-I'm sorry. Here I was in my own little world, talking to myself and dreaming about candy bracelets.
18276	J.D.	I don't like candy bracelets.
18277	J.D.'s Thoughts	I love them!
18278	J.D.'s Thoughts	Now you gotta grab that elevator. But not without giving him his patented shoulder bump!
18279	J.D.	Good day.
18280	J.D.	OW!
18281	J.D.	How you like me now?
18282	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18283	J.D.	Hey, you find your pink doggie yet?
18284	Elliot	Nope. But I had the pleasure of meeting Helen, the laundry room lady.
18285	J.D.	Oh, I think I know her! Does she have blonde hair?
18286	Elliot	No.
18287	J.D.	Brown hair?
18288	Elliot	Y-nuh-uh.
18289	J.D.	No hair!
18290	Elliot	That's the one.
18291	J.D.	Yeah, that's from the dryers.
18292	J.D.	Hey! You know, the janitor's still downstairs. Why don't we just check his custodial closet?
18293	Custodian	Hey. You're not welcome here.
18294	Randall	'Sup.
18295	J.D.	Randall?!
18296	Randall	Just got the job, brah.
18297	J.D.	So that's why he's been back in my dreams....
18298	Custodian	Beat it.
18299	J.D.	Gotta go.
18300	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18301	Turk	Did you bring my lucky 'do-rag?
18302	Carla	Why don't you wear the fluffy puppies 'do-rag that I got you for Lent?
18303	Turk	Baby, I hate to tell you this, but the fluffy puppies? They killed like three people they banned from the O.R.
18304	Carla	Well, what do you want me to do, Turk? I forgot!
18305	Turk	You forgot. You never pay attention to the little things that are important to me.
18306	J.D.'s Narration	You'd be surprised how when one thing goes wrong around here, everything seems to go wrong.
18307	J.D.	What happened?
18308	Dr. Cox	Vitals are tanking!
18309	Nurse Roberts	No pulse in lower extremities.
18310	J.D.	I don't get it, he wasn't showing any signs of distress!
18311	Dr. Cox	Come on, come on, come on! We gotta make a decision here.
18312	J.D.	Uh...let's get him a CT angiogram stat.
18313	Dr. Cox	Good.
18314	Dr. Cox	It's an aortic dissection. It's bad.
18315	J.D.	Call surgery. Tell 'em we're on our way.
18316	J.D.'s Narration	In a hospital, it's hard to avoid letting people down.
18317	J.D.'s Narration	Whether it's someone you made a promise to...
18318	Gaby	I want my doggie!
18319	Elliot	I'm so sorry.
18320	Dr. Cox	Let's go, Gandhi! You're on!
18321	J.D.'s Narration	...or someone you love...
18322	Turk	I gotta go.
18323	Carla	Turk, I'm sorry!
18324	J.D.'s Narration	...or even letting down someone you barely knew at all.
18325	J.D.'s Narration	In the end, it's the "what ifs" that hurt the most. Like, what if things had gone a little differently?
18326	Dr. Cox	Lookit, it's just that aortic dissections are a doctor's worst nightmare. If you don't catch 'em early, there's about a ninety percent mortality rate. I mean, honestly, unless your patient was lucky enough to trip and fall into a CAT-scan machine, he wasn't gonna have a happy ending. Newbie, we didn't have a chance on this one.
18327	J.D.'s Narration	Me, I don't believe in fate. I believe we have more control than we think, and that every action has a reaction. After all....
18328	J.D.'s Narration	The most minor event even a butterfly flapping its wings can change everything. Sometimes for the better. Even if it doesn't seem like it at first.
18329	Turk	Look away.
18330	J.D.	I can't.
18331	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18332	J.D.'s Narration	It's funny how a seemingly insignificant event can set everything else in motion.
18333	Turk	Hillside landing.
18334	Carla	What is wrong with you? I can't believe you're looking at that guy's cleavage while Suzy Big-Rack over there is sitting there busting out of her niece's tank top.
18335	Turk	How the hell did I miss that?
18336	Carla	Damn, you're whipped.
18337	Turk	Uh-uh!
18338	Carla	Kssshhh!
18339	J.D.	Mmmm! Orange Goo Goo!
18340	Nurse Roberts	Ain't nothing here for you, mooch!
18341	Janitor	All done.
18342	Elliot	Janitor, could you help me look for a little girl's pink stuffed doggie?
18343	Janitor	I would love to. I'll meet you upstairs in ten minutes.
18344	Elliot	You are like...the sweetest guy!
18345	Janitor	I'm blushing.
18346	J.D.	Heh. So charming. Could you be half as nice to me as you are to her?
18347	Janitor	You are right. We need a fresh start. Come on.
18348	J.D.	Fresh start.
18349	Janitor	Mm-hmm.
18350	Janitor	I think we need a longer fresh start.
18351	J.D.	How long do ya...suppose this'll be?
18352	Janitor	Probably ten minutes.
18353	Janitor	Ease into it. Let's mix it up let's saw some wood. There we go. Nice. Very good.
18354	J.D.'s Narration	And insignificant events can lead to significant events.
18355	J.D.'s Narration	Like me being late because I was in the world's longest handshake.
18356	J.D.	Sorry I'm late. What'd I miss?
18357	Dr. Cox	Take a wild guess.
18358	J.D.'s Thoughts	I should get Turk a washboard!
18359	Dr. Kelso	Son, do you think I got to be chief of medicine by being late?
18360	Dr. Cox	Nooo, Bobbo! You got there by back-stabbing and ass-kissing.
18361	Dr. Kelso	Maybe so, but I started those things promptly at 8.
18362	J.D.	Uh, Dr. Kelso? That's my pen.
18363	Dr. Cox	Nice grab.
18364	J.D.	I'm a righty.
18365	Dr. Cox	Ehhhhh.
18366	Carla	...You want me to go all the way home and search through your nasties and bring back your lucky 'do-rag?
18367	Turk	And if you could be back in twenty minutes, that'd be great.
18368	Dr. Kelso	Nurse Espinosa, your shift ended nine minutes ago. How is it that your time card isn't punched out?
18369	Carla	Well, sir
18370	Dr. Kelso	Start punching out on time or I'll punch you out on time!
18371	Dr. Kelso	I don't mean that violently, I was just trying to turn a phrase.
18372	Carla	Turk! Why didn't you stand up for me?
18373	Turk	Baby, you said I was too whipped.
18374	Carla	I need you to be more supportive.
18375	Turk	You're absolutely right, baby. And I apologize! Remember! 'Do-rag!

18377	Janitor	Hey, Helen.
18378	Helen	Hey, cutie.
18379	Elliot	Janitor? Thanks again for your help, but I know that you're busy. I mean, I could just call Carla, and
18380	Janitor	No! Mark my words: We will find that little girl's stuffed animal.
18381	Elliot	You are really taking a personal interest in this!
18382	Little Janitor	Mommy! Where's my teddy bear?
18383	Janitor's Mom	Oh. I must have accidentally thrown it out when I was cleaning up.
18384	Janitor's Mom	You know, this never would have happened if your room weren't so filthy.
18385	Janitor	Never again.
18386	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18387	Carla	Ewww.
18388	Carla	Eeeuugh!
18389	Carla	Ugh.
18390	Carla	Oh, hey. Thanks, Rowdy.
18391	Carla	Hey, by the way, as soon as we're married, you're outta here.
18392	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18393	Patient	Basically, I've had nausea and stomach pains for a couple of days now.
18394	J.D.	Maybe you should avoid eating sushi from the Gas 'n' Go.
18395	Patient	It came free with the fill-up! What am I supposed to do, just throw it away?
18396	Dr. Cox	Yes. Yes, you are. Fortunately, though, your vitals are normal, so we'll check back with you in a little while.
18397	J.D.	Sounds to me like a G.I. bleed.
18398	Dr. Cox	Look, Newbie, if you go ahead and leave this hospital knowing only one thing and God save me, it looks like there's a real chance that might happen please let this be that one thing: I'm in charge, and I don't care about your opinion. Now go get me a cup of coffee.
18399	J.D.'s Thoughts	Whatever. Just avoid the shoulder bump, catch the elevator, and make a great wise-ass remark before the doors close!
18400	J.D.	Hoohoo, hey, Dr. Cox, if you're so smart, maybe you should just...go ahead and be the...you're the kind of...
18401	J.D.	...Oh, dammit!
18402	J.D.	I don't know what happened there. I'm usually quick and funny....
18403	Doctor #1	So I had this guy today presenting vomiting and abdominal pain? Two hours and one CT later, I tell him he's got ischemic bowel.
18404	Dr. Mickhead	Mm.
18405	J.D.	Have you ever noticed that words that rhyme with "bowel" are always bad? Like "scowl", "growl"..."movies with Andie MacDowell"....
18406	Dr. Mickhead	You're right, J.D. You are funny.
18407	J.D.	Stop.
18408	J.D.'s Thoughts	Ischemic bowel! That's it!
18409	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18410	Elliot	Uhhmmm....
18411	Custodian	Heeeeyyy! Get outta here.
18412	Janitor	It's all right, Butchie, she's with me.
18413	Janitor	Where is that lost & found box?
18414	Randall	Over here, brah.
18415	Elliot	Why does it say "free stuff"?
18416	Janitor	Heh-heh. I have no idea.
18417	Janitor	Hey-hey-hey! Is that what you're looking for?
18418	Elliot	Awesome! What time is it?
18419	Janitor	Uhhh.... 4:30.
18420	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18421	Janitor	Dibs.
18422	Janitor	Dibs.
18423	Janitor	Butchie.

18425	Janitor	Back to work!
18426	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18427	Turk	You found it! Ha!
18428	Carla	'Course I did.
18429	Turk	See, that's what I love about you, baby. You always pick up on the little things that are important to me.
18430	Carla	Yeah, that's my job.
18431	Turk	Ah.
18432	J.D.'s Narration	You'd be surprised how when one thing goes right around here, everything seems to go right.
18433	J.D.	Look, Dr. Cox, I know my opinion doesn't mean anything and I'm always wrong and apparently useless which deep down you know isn't true because... ...shoot, I forgot your coffee. Anyway, I was thinking we should get a CT scan on Mr. Strauss, because he might have bowel ischemia.
18434	Dr. Cox	You know what, what the hell. It can't hurt. Let's get on it.
18435	J.D.	All right.
18436	J.D.	It doesn't look like he's ischemic.
18437	Dr. Cox	No, Newbie, but that right there is the start of an aortic dissection, and dammit all if we didn't catch it early.
18438	Mr. Strauss	Is that good?
18439	Dr. Cox	That's very good. Laverne, will you call the O.R. and have it prepped?
18440	J.D.'s Narration	In a hospital, it's great when you get to come through for someone.
18441	Gaby	Thanks!
18442	Elliot	See you when you wake up.
18443	Dr. Cox	Will you be joining us, there, Gandhi?
18444	Carla	Good luck.
18445	Turk	Already got it.
18446	Dr. Wen	Clamp.
18447	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, it still doesn't always work out the way you'd hope.
18448	Dr. Wen	Rachel, clean up.
18449	J.D.'s Narration	In the end, you learn to treasure the times when things go your way.
18450	Elliot	So glad you're okay!
18451	J.D.'s Narration	And be there for the ones you love when they don't.
18452	J.D.'s Narration	And most importantly, you learn to accept that some things are out of your hands.
18453	Dr. Cox	Didn't matter when we caught it, Newbie. It was just his time.
18454	J.D.	Yeah....
18455	J.D.'s Narration	But still, with so much of life left up to chance, you can't help but look back and wonder.... What if things had been different...?
18456	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18457	Turk	Buddy, I get that you and Carla have been hanging out a lot, but pretending you're gonna steal her from me makes you seem sad, pathetic, and very lonely.
18458	J.D.	Your woman wants me so bad, we've developed our own little shorthand with each other.
18459	J.D.	Mornin'!
18460	Carla	Morning!
18461	J.D.	That means "good morning"!
18462	Turk	Noted.
18463	Carla	Oooh.
18464	Carla	Come on!!!!
18465	J.D.	Enough beads! No more flashing.
18466	Carla	More beads, dammit! Come on!
18467	J.D.	Fine.
18468	Crowd	WOOOOOO!
18469	Carla	Yeah, baybee!
18470	Turk	Sounds pretty embarrassing.
18471	J.D.	Only because Jasper becomes an innie when he gets nervous....
18472	J.D.	Still
18473	&	Friends forever!!!!
18474	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, not all relationships are as solid as Carla's and mine.
18475	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Reid! Why are you using standard macrolides to treat your patient instead of Clovaritol?
18476	Dr. Cox	Ohh! Clovaritol is a drug? Now, honestly, Bob, here I was under the impression that it was a travel agency, what with all the free golf trips they've gone ahead and sent you on.
18477	Dr. Kelso	I'll have you know that I do not authorize any drug for this hospital that I haven't personally researched.
18478	Elliot	What did the research for Clovaritol say, sir?
18479	Dr. Kelso	"When life's not fair at all...use Clovaritol..."
18480	Dr. Cox	Check out Barbie bo-hody slamming big Bob! Atta girl!
18481	Elliot	Look, I have spent the last three years in this hospital getting pushed around because I'm "little Barbie from Connecticut!" But there is a new toy in town, and her name is Bitch-Slap Barbie! ...From...Connecticut.
18482	Dr. Cox	Still, let's remember that you can't even drive the doctor car without big daddy sitting right there beside you. Because you went ahead and accidentally gave the patient over in bed four macrolides and opiates two medications that I guarantee you are gonna make her nauseous.
18483	Elliot	My patient is fine. And I don't need you to
18484	Dr. Cox	I roughly think that would be the faint sound of your patient vomiting. You may be having trouble hearing it over the much louder sound of me being right yet again. Oooooh.
18485	Dr. Cox	God! My brilliance is now becoming a bit of a burden. Get back to me.
18486	Carla	I gotta give Mr. Ingram his meds so, latah!
18487	J.D.	Latah!
18488	J.D.	That means "I'll be seeing you later."
18489	Turk	You want my fiancée? Just go ahead and take her, 'cause she's been nagging the crap outta me. "Pick up your socks. Wash your dishes. Stop whispering 'booya' to J.D. in the morning after we have sex."
18490	J.D.	How else am I supposed to know?
18491	Turk	I'm sayin'!
18492	J.D.	Ooooooh! That ass warrants the Batman sound effects loop!
18493	Turk	POW!
18494	J.D.	ZAP!
18495	Turk	BOPYOWoooooo.....
18496	Carla	Turk, how come every time I turn around you're checking out some woman's you-know-what?
18497	J.D.	Tushie parts?
18498	Turk	Thanks for having my back.
18499	Turk	Babe.
18500	J.D.	That means "now she all maaad."
18501	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18502	J.D.'s Narration	When you work in a hospital, you can count on an ever-changing roster of new faces. Whether it's the new flower lady who winks too much...
18503	J.D.'s Narration	...or the plastic surgeon who's returned after spending three years fixing cleft palates in third world countries.
18504	Dr. Kelso	So, if any of you are interested in following in the philanthropic footsteps of Dr. Ramirez, he has graciously offered to answer any of your questions.
18505	Dr. Kelso	I told you no one would care.
18506	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes a new face will just outright surprise you.
18507	Turk	What the hell are you doing?
18508	Roscoe Janitor	Me? Nothing, man. Just waiting for my brother to get off work. Maybe you know him! He's a janitor here? My name's Roscoe.
18509	Turk	Why is he doing that?
18510	J.D.	I think he gets bored.
18511	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18512	Carla	So I'm supposed to marry someone who can stare at women for the rest of my life?
18513	J.D.	Well, I wouldn't put it that way in your vows.
18514	Carla	Well, let's see how he likes it when I do it in front of him.
18515	Carla	Hey, honey!
18516	Turk	What's up, baby.
18517	Carla	Mm! Mm! MM!
18518	Turk	It's good, isn't it? That's because every time Estelle's working, she puts extra croutons into the stuffing.
18519	J.D.	And yet the salads always suffer....
18520	Carla	Excuse me. I am talking about that man's ass?
18521	Turk	Gotta go.
18522	Carla	You know, 'cause it's such a fine, chiseled, dig-your-fingernails-into-it kinda ass!
18523	Turk	Babe, he probably works out.
18524	Dr. Ramirez	Carla?
18525	Carla	Ron....
18526	Dr. Ramirez	Hey!
18527	Carla	Hi!
18528	J.D.	Kudos on the nice pooper.
18529	Dr. Ramirez	...Thank you...
18530	J.D.	Mine's firm, like mutton.
18531	Dr. Ramirez	Lovely.
18532	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18533	Elliot	Okay, Mr. Thompson, we've got your fever down, but how's the pain in your abdomen?
18534	Mr. Thompson	Practically gone.
18535	Elliot	Really? Huh!
18536	Mr. Thompson	Aaagh!
18537	Elliot	Heh. Little trick I picked up in med school.
18538	Mr. Thompson	Good trick!
18539	Elliot	Hm.
18540	Mr. Thompson	I think my insides exploded!
18541	Elliot	Now, I suspect you've got pancreatitis, so we're gonna run some LFTs and do an ultrasound, but in the meantime I am going to prescribe you something for your pain.
18542	Mr. Thompson	No, no, no, no, please. Please, don't sweat it. I'm used to the pain. Besides, my mom is bringing by the kids later, and I figure there should be at least one sober adult in the room.
18543	Mr. Thompson	No, seriously, she's a drunk.
18544	Elliot	Ew, sorry. Heh.
18545	Elliot	Oh, you!
18546	Mr. Thompson	Stop it.
18547	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18548	J.D.'s Narration	There's nothing worse than being around two people with a history.
18549	Ron	So did Sherry and Steve ever get married?
18550	Carla	You didn't hear what happened?
18551	J.D.'s Thoughts	Please say you heard.
18552	Dr. Ramirez	No, I didn't!
18553	J.D.'s Thoughts	Damn you, Ron!
18554	Carla	Steve took a year off to take care of his parents, and while he was gone, Sherry starting seeing Dr. Harding.
18555	J.D.'s Thoughts	Nooooo!
18556	Dr. Ramirez	Really!?
18557	Carla	Yes!
18558	Dr. Ramirez	Sherry and Gary?
18559	J.D.'s Thoughts	Nooooo!
18560	Carla	Yes!
18561	J.D.	Oh, thank God!
18562	J.D.	You know, 'cause they...they both died doing what they loved.... Rafting.
18563	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18564	Elliot	So everybody treating you okay?
18565	Mr. Thompson	Yeah! You know, the nurse that does the sponge baths, I wouldn't be shocked if she's killed before.
18566	Mr. Thompson	Heeey, sunshine!
18567	Nurse Roberts	Why don't you just calm your ass down? You was barely bleeding.
18568	Mr. Thompson	From a _bath_, woman!
18569	Nurse Roberts	Mmmm-hmmm.
18570	Elliot	I don't get it. I've run every single test; I cannot figure out why this guy is in so much pain.
18571	Dr. Cox	Did you run a D-U-H test?
18572	Elliot	What's a "D-U-H"?
18573	Dr. Cox	Uh, duuuuuh! The guy is a drug addict trying to score pain killers.
18574	Elliot	But he refused drugs.
18575	Dr. Cox	Mm! My bad! He is a very _clever_ drug addict. Look, I hate to question your three years of wisdom, but your pain guy is just like a million other drug addicts walking the hospitals every year with their aches, and their pains, and their spasms, and their cramps, and their myalgia, and their neuralgia, and their otalgia, and their every other -algia they can possibly think of just so they can get a fix.
18576	Elliot	Well, I believe in this guy.
18577	Dr. Cox	Would you like to go out on a limb? Sign him in, keep him overnight?
18578	Elliot	You know, Dr. Cox, you think that you have seen it all and done it all, but guess what? Heh. You haven't done me!
18579	Dr. Cox	Give her a second there, gang.
18580	Elliot	That didn't come out right.
18581	Dr. Cox	Go!
18582	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18583	J.D.	Yo, if you're captain out there today, pick me first, and then I'll be like, "Dude, we always play together!" Then you can pick who you really wanted to pick, but everyone else will think you wanted to pick me first.
18584	Turk	When do you think of this stuff?
18585	J.D.	Every minute of every day.
18586	Janitor	Hey, either of you guys see my twin brother?
18587	Janitor	Hey, I asked you a question!
18588	Turk	You're better than this!
18589	Roscoe Janitor	Naghhey! Any sign of my brother? The janitor?
18590	Turk	Dude, there is no way that we'll ever, ever believe this one.
18591	Janitor	Could someone say "keep rockin'"?
18592	Roscoe Janitor	Argh!
18593	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18594	J.D.	Hey, Carla, after you check Mr. Ruck's IV in room 310, can you zip down to the cafeteria and flirt more with Dr. Hot Butt?
18595	Carla	Fine. So I was flirting with him a little. But...I used to have such a crush on the guy! And besides, you flirt sometimes. It's harmless, right?
18596	Woman	Can I press your button?
18597	J.D.	I don't know.... Can I press yours?
18598	J.D.	Not always harmless.
18599	Dr. Ramirez	Hey! Uh, Carla.... I was, uh, wondering if...you wanted to grab dinner with me tonight.
18600	J.D.'s Narration	It's always a risk when you go out on a limb. Ultimately, you just make yourself vulnerable.
18601	Elliot	Laverne, did you pull up Mr. Thompson's old charts?
18602	Nurse Roberts	He was here like eight years ago complaining of the same abdominal pain, but as soon as he was given his pain medication, he went AMA.
18603	Elliot	What, he just took the drugs and bolted?
18604	Nurse Roberts	No.... He took some towels, too.
18605	Elliot	Frick!
18606	Dr. Ramirez	So what do you say?
18607	J.D.'s Narration	And you just hate to see anyone get crushed. ...Even Dr. Hot Butt.
18608	Carla	Sure! That sounds great!
18609	J.D.'s Thoughts	I'm sorry, what?
18610	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18611	J.D.	What the hell just happened?
18612	Carla	I don't know! He asked me out to dinner and I said yes! It just came out!
18613	J.D.	Shame!
18614	Carla	Look! Everyone thinks it's just guys who get all freaked out before the wedding, but it happens to women too!
18615	J.D.	"Ronnie"?
18616	Carla	"Ron." Ron he's not just some guy, J.D. He's my "what if?" guy. The one I always wondered about, the one I idealized, you know?
18617	J.D.	Now I want you to go.
18618	J.D.'s Thoughts	That she's a sorceress!
18619	Carla	Look, I would never do anything inappropriate.
18620	J.D.	Then you won't mind if I tell Turk!
18621	Carla	If you have to, go ahead. But! Then I'll know that we're not as close as I thought!
18622	J.D.	Damn beads....
18623	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18624	Elliot	Mr. Thompson, I was just taking a look at your old chart!
18625	Dr. Kelso	Yes! He was just telling me that the last time he was here his doctor couldn't diagnose him and just threw a bunch of pain killers at him instead!
18626	Elliot	He did?
18627	Mr. Thompson	I was so frustrated, I took off.
18628	Dr. Kelso	So this pain you're having is making you delusional.
18629	Mr. Thompson	No. Why?
18630	Dr. Kelso	No reason.
18631	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18632	Carla	Well, this is nice. After all these years, actually being out with you.
18633	Dr. Ramirez	Yeah.... So, where do you want to sit?
18634	Carla	How 'bout here?
18635	Waiter	We have a lovely selection of condoms.
18636	Carla	Ooh! Lemon zinger!
18637	J.D.	Uncool!
18638	Turk	What were you thinking about?
18639	J.D.	...What you'd look like if you were Chinese...?
18640	Turk	Me too!
18641	J.D.'s Thoughts	Hoo! That was lucky!
18642	Janitor	Hey, fellas! Guess what's on! A little show that I like to call Indisputable Evidence!
18643	Troy	Thank you, brothers, for inviting me to your twin birthday party!
18644	Janitor	No problem, Troy! Hey, brother! Why don't you enjoy this nice pen set that I got for ya! Check it out!
18645	Janitor	Take your time! Approach it slowly!
18646	Roscoe Janitor	Hey! Wow! Thanks, bro! I'm definitely gonna use this to write to you when I finish my around the world travels. Put 'er there, man.
18647	Roscoe Janitor	All right! You do a good job around here!
18648	Janitor	And that, boys, is a brotherly handshake.
18649	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes around here you can't believe what you're seeing...
18650	J.D.'s Narration	...Other times it's as clear as day.
18651	Elliot	Thanks.
18652	Dr. Cox	Ohhh, great! You're getting medication for your pain patient! But, say, why stop there? How's about we load up our fanny packs with happy pills, drive downtown, I'll hang out of the sun-roof, and we can just throw fistfuls of 'em right at drug addicts and it'll just be a big happy parade!
18653	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18654	Elliot	You know what's amazing about you? You have this unbelievable ability to make me doubt myself.
18655	Dr. Cox	I don't think I could possibly make you doubt yourself, ya rascal, unless you had the unnatural talent for being wrong most of the time.
18656	Elliot	Well, I'm not wrong. I just saw Mr. Thompson writhing in pain, and he had no idea that I was watching him. But you probably don't care about that, because you're more concerned with _being_ right than _doing_ what's right. Aren't you?
18657	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18658	J.D.'s Thoughts	Stay calm. Turk's never gonna find out about her date.
18659	Turk	Hey!
18660	J.D.'s Thoughts	AGGH!
18661	Turk	You got a minute to talk?
18662	J.D.	I got lots of time to talk. Do you wanna talk about anything? Anything? Hours to talk. We could talk about our feelings. Wh-what's up?
18663	Turk	Look, I been thinking about this whole Carla nagging me thing, right? And I know it's coming from a good place because, well, let's face it, the woman lives and dies for me.
18664	Carla	Mm.
18665	Dr. Ramirez	More wine?
18666	Carla	Oh, God! Yes!
18667	Turk	So I'm supposed to marry someone who's gonna bust my chops every time I look at a woman for the rest of my life?
18668	J.D.	Well, I wouldn't put it that way in your vows.... Hand me that?
18669	Turk	Here you go.
18670	Carla	So you and that girl Kelly finally broke up, huh?
18671	Dr. Ramirez	Yeah.... What was that cute name that you used to call her?
18672	Carla	Skunk-face! ...I was a little mean back then.
18673	Dr. Ramirez	Nahhh. I always used to think you were...the sweetest girl on earth.
18674	Turk	Nag! Nag! Nag! Nag! You see how Carla is lately. I mean, is that all I have to look forward to?
18675	J.D.	I hear they're coming out with a 'Stuart Little 3'.
18676	Turk	Nah, it's on hold. The director dropped out.
18677	J.D.	Turk, don't you have any work to do?
18678	Turk	Dude. Surgeon.
18679	J.D.	Beads, keep me strong!
18680	Turk	What?
18681	J.D.	Nothing.
18682	Carla	I'm so glad we did this!
18683	Dr. Ramirez	Oh, me too. You know, I have to leave for a lecture tour on Monday, but I'm back the last week in April, so maybe we can get together then.
18684	Carla	I'm getting married April 24th.
18685	Dr. Ramirez	So then our plans would totally interfere with your honeymoon.
18686	Carla	A little bit.
18687	Dr. Ramirez	Excited about it?
18688	Carla	I'm so excited.
18689	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18690	Elliot	Mr. Thompson, I have decided I'd like to prescribe you something for the pain.
18691	Mr. Thompson	Well, you know, that's your call.
18692	Elliot	There's just...one little problem.
18693	Mr. Thompson	Oh, my God! Just give me the drugs! 'Kay, lady? For God's sake, I've been working you from every possible angle: I refused pain killers; I did the "you're the greatest doctor!" bit, which I know you loved; then somewhere between, uh, getting a tube in my ass and a tube in my mouth which, by the way, I'm still praying wasn't the same tube I found time to do the whole "I'm writhing in pain but I don't know if you're watching me" thing! So please, or pretty please, or however you want me to say it, Doctor, why don't you say it! Why don't you say it! Why don't you tell me what the problem is, AND SAY IT!
18694	Elliot	Um.... I was just gonna say that my pen doesn't work, and I needed a new one to write out your dosage.
18695	Mr. Thompson	Oh. Awesome.
18696	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18697	Carla	I felt nothing for him! How cool is that!
18698	J.D.	I had a dream just like this...except I had a saddle on my back and you were an Indian. Turk was a donkey.
18699	Carla	I'm gonna go tell Turk.
18700	J.D.'s Thoughts	Awww, that's great. She's gonna go Wait, what?
18701	Carla	Whoooa!
18702	J.D.	Whatever you do, don't scream.
18703	Carla	Why would I scream?
18704	J.D.	I don't know. People always said that in the movies.
18705	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18706	Turk	You did what!?
18707	J.D.	Make that twenty years.
18708	Turk	Honey, that was a long time ago.
18709	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18710	Turk	Why are you still living here?
18711	J.D.	Because I've got nowhere else to go!
18712	J.D.	Sorry.
18713	Carla	But still, what if I want to tell him?
18714	J.D.	Well, that's up to you, isn't it! Gotta go!
18715	Carla	Damn beads.
18716	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18717	Janitor	Yuk it up, I don't care. I'm getting the last laugh! 'Cause my brother's waiting for me downstairs, and when these elevator doors open, you'll see, he's gonna be staring right at you two guys.
18718	Janitor	Okay, I don't know what I thought was gonna happen, but I think we can all agree that this isn't working out, it's costing me a tremendous amount of time and effort, so let's just call it a draw.
18719	Turk	Hell, no! You lost! Live with it!
18720	J.D.'s Narration	It's hard when you lose for the first time.
18721	J.D.'s Narration	It's even harder when it's the hundredth time.
18722	Dr. Cox	Say it.
18723	Elliot	You're always right.
18724	Dr. Cox	I know! But it is still so nice to hear it.
18725	Elliot	How did you know that he was lying?
18726	Dr. Cox	Well, you said that he wasn't; and as a rule, I always take whatever you say and just go in the exact opposite direction with it. But, more than that, Barbie, the main reason is because...well, lookit, medicine is all about experience. Hell, wouldja......wouldja like to go ahead and have a look at who the last doctor was to give Thompson drugs?
18727	Elliot	You?
18728	Dr. Cox	Oh!
18729	Elliot	Why didn't you say something earlier?
18730	Dr. Cox	What, give up my front-row seat to Barbie's Wild Ride? "He's a drug addict! He's not a drug addict! You make me doubt my self!
18731	Dr. Cox	"You're more interested in being right than doing what's right! And I just couldn't take it! Can't take it anymore!"
18732	J.D.'s Narration	And yet sometimes losing is a good thing.
18733	J.D.'s Narration	Like, for instance, when you lose your insecurities about the guy you're marrying, which makes it a whole lot easier to cut him some slack once in a while.
18734	Carla	Go ahead, look.
18735	Turk	Really, baby?
18736	Carla	Yeah. Besides, you're cutting up your napkin.
18737	J.D.'s Narration	I guess you can never underestimate how the smallest gesture can make everything better.
18738	J.D.	You know, for a minute there I actually thought you had a twin brother.
18739	Janitor	Really?
18740	J.D.	Mm.
18741	Janitor	Was it when my twin brother was here?
18742	J.D.	Stop it.
18743	Janitor	Sorry.
18744	Janitor	Too much.
18745	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18746	J.D.'s Thoughts	Today's gonna be a great day. Still, no time to dilly-dally God, that's a fun phrase I have to meet Dr. Cox in five
18747	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18748	J.D.'s Thoughts	Good God! Check out those dilly-dallies! That may be the future Mrs.
18749	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, back to work. Because Dr. Cox has hand-selected me to help him on a research project.
18750	J.D.	Hey, research buddy!
18751	Dr. Cox	We're four seconds in and I'm already regretting my decision.
18752	J.D.	Things Jordan says during sex! Ha!
18753	Dr. Cox	Are those the charts I wanted?
18754	J.D.	Noooo. They're the charts you wanted, plus! patient history charts from the last ten years, which yours truly stayed up all night organizing not only chronologically but by severity of condition.
18755	J.D.	There's a good chance I'm gonna kill someone.
18756	Dr. Cox	Things you say when you talk to your patients.
18757	J.D.	Clever.
18758	Dr. Cox	Ah, don't bother with that, Trish. You know, I've been getting my hair cut by my barber, Big Frank, for seventeen years now. Is it because his prices remained the same? No. Is it because I like the way his man-breasts feel gently resting on my shoulders when he does my sideburns? A little, yes. But, mainly, it's because, unlike you, he does just exactly what I tell him to do. You see, it's my way or the highway, and since you've already broken that dictum you're out!
18759	J.D.	No, but wait!
18760	J.D.	I already got my shifts covered for the next two days! Besides, where're you gonna find somebody else? You think Lonnie, my intern, gives a rat's ass about acute thomrobotic thrombocytopenic purpura?
18761	Lonnie	ATTP? It killed my father.
18762	Dr. Cox	You're in.
18763	Lonnie	It is gonna be so amazing working on the disease that tore my family apart.
18764	J.D.	Kiss ass.
18765	J.D.'s Thoughts	I guess I could go home.... But there's plenty of important stuff I need to do around here.
18766	J.D.	Hey, Laverne. What'd you give me if I get this jelly bean into your cleavage?
18767	Nurse Roberts	A concussion.
18768	Elliot	Guys! Three long years of busting my hump at this place and it has finally paid off!
18769	J.D.	You got the fellowship?
18770	Elliot	No! I get to be the clown in Pediatrics!
18771	Carla	Heeeey! That old clown was really good. So, uh, you got some really big shoes to fill!
18772	Carla	Dammit, I'm funny!
18773	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18774	J.D.	YES! He hits it at the buzzer!
18775	Nurse Roberts	Oh, no he didn't.
18776	J.D.	Aaaagggghhhh!
18777	Nurse Roberts	Haaaaah!
18778	J.D.'s Thoughts	Not worth it.

18780	J.D.	Dude, my tongue is totally dry. How many more of these wedding invites do I have to lick?
18781	Turk	Fine. Don't lick 'em.
18782	J.D.'s Thoughts	Come on, don't get mad at Turk. What's really bugging me is that, thanks to Dr. Cox, I've got nothing to do...nothing to talk about...no stories to tell.
18783	Turk's Thoughts	From the moment I woke up this morning, I have been freaking out about getting married. Luckily, Carla's being cool.
18784	Carla	Okay, this is your last chance to uninvite that slut you went out with in high school.
18785	Turk	She's married to my brother!
18786	Carla	Isn't that convenient.
18787	Turk's Thoughts	Thank God she thinks that hot chick, Tina, I invited is my cousin! Well guess what! There's no blood there, baby!
18788	Carla	Oh, and by the way, don't think for a second that your "cousin" Tina's gonna be sitting at our table.
18789	Turk's Thoughts	Oh, my God! She's in my head!
18790	Turk's Thoughts	Make me a grilled cheese sandwich, woman!
18791	Carla	Make it yourself.

18793	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18794	Turk	Thanks for driving me to work, man.
18795	J.D.	You kidding? I wanted to see the mailing of the invites! Once you drop those suckers in, there's no turning back! I'm just mad I forgot my camera.... Or did I?
18796	J.D.	Ha!
18797	Turk	WHAOA!
18798	Carla	It's okay, sweetie, just drop them in here.
18799	Turk	I don' wanna.
18800	Carla	If you're nervous, come here and I'll tell you a secret that'll make you feel better.
18801	Carla	Come here. Come here.

18804	Elliot	Sean, I'm just bummed that I'm so busy I might not be able to do this clown thing today. I know I'm a doctor first, but what about that summer I spent at clown academy? I mean, it's starting to seem like that was just a giant waste of time. I wish you were here. I can't believe you've been in New Zealand for 5 months.
18805	Sean	I can't believe you still haven't figured out the time difference. It's 4 A.M. here!
18806	Elliot	I'm sorry.... It's just I miss talking to you...I miss seeing you...I even miss that weird way you sleep with your eyes open.
18807	Elliot	Sean? Sean!
18808	Turk's Thoughts	Daaaamn, Elliot's got a nice ass for a white chick!
18809	Turk's Thoughts	Oh, great, my new scary boss and her amazing chest, butt, feet.... I love feet.
18810	Dr. Miller	Dr. Turk! This is Bryan. You'll be assisting me on his tumor debulking this afternoon.
18811	Turk	Wussuuuuuuuup, Bry-Bry! You, my friend, have just won the lottery. I'm not saying I'm good, but if there was a surgeon awards show around here, it'd be called The Turkies. You know what I'm sayin'?
18812	Dr. Cox	You don't have to know what he's sayin' none of us do.
18813	Dr. Miller	Mmmm....may I have a quick moment?
18814	Dr. Miller	Mm, excuse us.
18815	Turk's Thoughts	What now, you mean witch?
18816	Dr. Miller	I'm sorry, but if you act like a cartoon character in front of one of our patients again, I'm gonna spend the next ten years introducing you as the guy who sponges off my forehead.
18817	Dr. Miller	Bryan! Dr. Turk is gonna take you back to your room.
18818	Dr. Cox	That was...that was glorious.
18819	Dr. Miller	Okay.
18820	Turk	You didn't mind that cocky stuff, did ya?
18821	Bryan	Noooo. I love "Bry-Bry". Never had a nickname before.

18824	Elliot	What are you doing here? I thought you had like two days off?
18825	J.D.	Had to pick up a mouth guard from oral surgery. Some of the kids at the park said I couldn't jump Jones Creek on my bicycle; so now I gotta give 'em the 4-1-1 on my mad daredevilin' skills!
18826	Elliot	Meanwhile, back in adult world.... I was just given twelve new admits and now there's no way that I can be a clown for the kids today!
18827	J.D.	Ooh, you know, if it helps, I could I could examine her...for you. Elliot, please!
18828	J.D.	Ow! It hurt through my helmet!
18829	Elliot	Heh. Mrs. Bell, your EKG showed a slight irregularity, but nothing too serious.
18830	Mrs. Bell	Maybe when my husband hears that he'll stop worrying, go home and get some rest.
18831	Mr. Bell	Hey, honey?
18832	Elliot	Oh, and this must be your hobbit! I mean husband! Of course. Heh. I rented 'Lord of the Rings' last night, so.... I would do Frodo. ...He's short...too. Heh.

18834	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Miller! I am attending a hospital administrator's luncheon this afternoon. I would love for you to join me.
18835	Dr. Cox	Not so fast, there, Bob. You forgot to affix the warning label to your forehead. You know, the one that reads "Exposure to Bob Kelso can be hazardous to your health" thus affording the reader a fighting chance to escape the waste and contamination that is...Bob Kelso.
18836	Dr. Kelso	Gosh, darn it, Perry, you are entertaining. You know, like Howie Mandel or a monkey in a funny hat.
18837	Todd	Check out Cox and Kelso fighting over Dr. New Girl!
18838	Dr. Kelso	No, she's coming with me!
18839	Dr. Cox	I want her.

18843	Turk	She'll have to get one of those cars you drive with your feet!
18844	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Miller, I hope to see you later.
18845	Dr. Cox	Look, I like you...so here's some advice: Never, ever do anything with Bob Kelso. Don't talk to him, don't look at him, don't even associate with guys his age on the outside chance that they just shared a steam together in that never ending Klan meeting that they call a "country club"; right? He is...pure evil.
18846	Dr. Miller	I'll remember that. Not the crazy "where the hell is he going with this?" ranting, but you know, the gist the Bob Kelso-bad part.
18847	Dr. Cox	Fair enough.

18854	Carla	Yep! The invitations went out today!
18855	Turk	Yes! You know they did, baby! Invitations went out _today_!
18856	Turk	No, they didn't!
18857	Bryan	I could never get a girl like that.
18858	Turk	Why?
18859	Bryan	Well, girls don't usually go for the piano-playing power geek.
18860	Turk	Are you a good pianist?
18861	Turk's Thoughts	"Pianist"! Heeheehee!
18862	Bryan	Yeah, I got a scholarship to Juilliard.
18863	Turk	Bry-Bry! You're in the money! Girl's love the artsy type you'll be getting more tail than you know what to do with.

18870	J.D.	I don't know the exact distance in terms of feet and inches, but in laymen's terms, I would have to say...about halfway.
18871	Dr. Cox	Never stop peddling, Annie. You are a shoo-in for the Little Girl X-Games.
18872	Dr. Miller	Has anyone seen Dr. Kelso? We're supposed to leave for that luncheon.
18873	Dr. Cox	Oh, that's strange. Because I remember having a conversation with you about this very subject never do anything with him, pure evil ringing any bells?
18874	Dr. Miller	Just the one in my head that goes off when I'm incredibly bored.
18875	Dr. Kelso	Wow! Perry, people usually don't stop caring about what you have to say 'til after they've been here a few months! Oh, no he didn't!
18876	Dr. Kelso	That's the correct use of that phrase, right?
18877	Dr. Miller	I don't know, sir.
18878	J.D.	Ow!

18887	Elliot	See, I've got this boyfriend, except he's all the way in New Zealand and...well...how did you know that Mr. Bell was the right guy for you?
18888	Mrs. Bell	Kurt was the one that was always there for me. And at the end of the day, that's who you want the guy who shows up when you need him, without having to ask.
18889	J.D.	Dr. Reid couldn't be here today, children, so I'm here in her place.
18890	Kid	Why're your pants so tight? Clowns have baggy pants!

18900	Turk's Thoughts	That's a yes! And now her mind will drift back to that wonderful day. Wait for it....
18901	Turk's Thoughts	...And there it is.
18902	Turk	Dr. Miller, please, feel free to drift off. Although there is a lot of bleeding.
18903	Dr. Miller	You lacerated the brachial artery. Move out of the way!
18904	Dr. Miller	Look, you made a mistake. Every one of us has made a mistake. You should consider yourself lucky instead of losing his arm he'll just have some nerve damage and limited use of his right hand. It could have been a lot worse. If you want I'll even tell him for you.

18916	Dr. Cox	Well, now, you are looking slim. Are those new scrubs? Or is it the fact you no longer have a soul?
18917	Dr. Miller	What's your problem?
18918	Dr. Cox	Come on, the only reason Kelso wanted you at that dinner is because he knows standing next to a pretty doctor will get his picture in all the medical journals. Assuming his image actually shows up in photographs.
18919	Dr. Kelso	So what? Publicity is good for the hospital. Plus, pictures of us together lend credence to the rumors that you and I are having a fling.
18920	Dr. Kelso	I'm joking! There are no rumors.
18921	Dr. Kelso	The point is, Cox just wants you on his side, and until that happens he's gonna be all over you.
18922	Dr. Cox	Fine, maybe he's right.
18923	Dr. Miller	Please get out of here.
18924	Dr. Cox	Look, you're in with Kelso now, but trust me, he will turn on you the minute you say no to him on anything.
18925	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Miller! Would you care to accompany me to the proctology dinner tonight?
18926	Dr. Cox	Yeah! Wouldja!?

18934	J.D.	Okay, let's take a little break, kids. Duck, Duck, Eel.
18935	Lonnie	Mr. Millican just died, and his family needs to be notified. Since I'm still kind of new at this, I was hoping you could do it.

18955	Turk's Thoughts	So I didn't tell him.... It's not like it would change anything.
18956	Carla	Christopher!
18957	Turk	"Christopher"? You only call me Christopher when you're mad...or when we're having sex. Baby, are you mad when we're having sex?
18958	Carla	Sometimes.
18959	Carla	Come. Let's take a walk.
18960	Turk's Thoughts	Oh, this is bad. Okay, what did I do? Think. I accidentally got her a present on my ex-girlfriend's birthday. I referred to that new cute nurse as a young Carla Espinosa damn, that was stupid. I've been known to leave my toenail clippings on her throw pillow. Oh, and I forgot to put the toilet seat down last night and she bruised her butt! Wow, why is she marrying me? Marrying me! Oh, God! She knows I haven't mailed the invites!
18961	Carla	I thought you might want to talk to Bryan before you went home.
18962	Turk	How'd you know?
18963	Carla	Who you talkin' to?
18964	Carla	Get in there.
18965	Turk	Okay.
18966	Turk	Bryan. Uh.... Look, I got a confession to make, man.
18967	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18968	Dr. Kelso	Ahh, there's my dinner buddy! Shall we head out?
18969	Dr. Miller	Oh, no, no, no. I'm not going. I have a date. And even if I didn't, I don't think I'd want to go to a snooze-fest with a bunch of drunk proctologists just so you could get your picture in the latest edition of Bend Over Weekly.
18970	Dr. Kelso	A simple "I'm busy" would have sufficed.
18971	Dr. Cox	Big boys don't cry, there, Bobbo.
18972	Dr. Miller	Why are you smiling?
18973	Dr. Cox	Oh, I don't know, I guess I'm just glad you wound up in my camp.
18974	Dr. Miller	Yeah, I'm an adult, I don't actually go to camp. Listen, if Dr. Kelso had asked me to go somewhere that I thought was actually good for my career, I'd be gone so fast you'd be left here staring at an imaginary woman's chest while she was trying to make a point.
18975	Dr. Cox	I'm I'm sorry, you're right, it's my fault. That dress just screams "respect me as a doctor." Heh.
18976	Dr. Miller	You try and paint Dr. Kelso as this jackass who turns on people who don't do his bidding, when you were ready to write me off just for having lunch. So honestly? How are you any different?
18977	Dr. Cox	I'm taller than he is?
18978	Dr. Miller	Hmm. Feel free to watch me leave.
18979	Turk's Thoughts	It's weird. Just by the simple act of pushing me to do the right thing, I remembered why Carla's the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with.
18980	Turk's Thoughts	End of story.
18981	J.D.	You did it!
18982	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, man, what a long day.
18983	J.D.'s Thoughts	Still, any day can be salvaged by drinking a few cold ones with a good friend.
18984	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
18985	J.D.	Awesome. 'Judge Dredd' is starting.
18986	Elliot	Mm.
18987	Elliot	You still have a little clown makeup on you!
18988	J.D.	Elliot, The Judge, please.
18989	Elliot	Fine, I'll get it.
18990	J.D.'s Thoughts	What the hell is she doing? It's The Judge!
18991	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh.
18992	J.D.	I can't find the clasp.
18993	Elliot	What?
18994	J.D.	The clasp! The clasp!
18995	Elliot	I switched to frontsies!
18996	J.D.'s Thoughts	Naughty!
18997	Elliot	Position One, Two, or Three?
18998	J.D.	We only had two.
18999	Elliot	Oh, yeah. Well, I have something to show you later.
19000	J.D.'s Narration	It's a mystery how one woman can drive you crazy over and over again.
19001	J.D.'s Narration	While another can bring you right back down to earth.
19002	J.D.'s Narration	In the end, you have to trust that the perfect woman will always lead you in the right direction.
19003	Carla	So did you ever get the guts to mail the invitations?
19004	J.D.	Look, Elliot, I don't want to jinx this, but, how did that just happen?
19005	Elliot	You were a clown for me. You were there when I needed you without me even having to ask.
19006	J.D.	Sean?
19007	Elliot	Sean!?
19008	Elliot	Oh, my God! When did you get back from New Zealand?
19009	Sean	Something in your voice told me that you needed me. So I just...I decided to show up, even though you didn't even ask.
19010	Elliot	Ohhh, Sean....
19011	Sean	Good to see ya, J.D.
19012	Sean	Hey! You switched to frontsies!
19013	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19014	J.D.'s Narration	I can't stop thinking about last night. I mean, it's incredible how fast things can go from amazing...
19015	J.D.'s Narration	...to complete disaster.
19016	&	SEAN?
19017	Sean	I have been looking all over for you!
19018	Elliot	What are you doing back from New Zealand?
19019	Turk	Morning.
19020	Carla	What's up with him?
19021	Turk	He slept with Elliot last night.
19022	Carla	Is it _that_ time of year again?
19023	Turk	Dude, ignore her. That's three years in a row who's feeling you?
19024	J.D.	You be.
19025	J.D.	She's already back with Sean.
19026	Carla	How soon after you guys hooked up?
19027	J.D.	About ninety seconds.
19028	Turk	Oooooh.
19029	J.D.	What should I do?
19030	J.D.'s Narration	That was a huge mistake. Because the closer Turk and Carla got to their wedding, the more they became one of those annoying couples that thought they knew everything about relationships.
19031	&	Look, J.D....
19032	Turk	You first, honey.
19033	Carla	J.D., love is like a butterfly. Hold it too tight and...you'll crush it.
19034	Turk	Too loose and it flies away.
19035	Carla	Mmm.
19036	J.D.'s Narration	The phone call was Elliot asking me to meet her so we could talk.
19037	J.D.	Irrrrrv!
19038	Irv	Howdy, Dr. Dorian.
19039	Irv	I'm sorry, sir. But there's no parking allowed at the emergency curb. But I'd be happy to park your car for ya, and run the keys up to you in a jiff.
19040	Guy	Yeah.... Except this is my only set? And I'm afraid you might eat them. Okay? See ya, tubs.
19041	Irv	I've been trying like the dickens to cut down on my snacking, but it's just so
19042	J.D.	Ehp-ehp-ehp! You look great, Irv!
19043	J.D.'s Narration	Irv didn't look great, but I didn't have time to talk.
19044	J.D.	Danni!?
19045	J.D.'s Narration	When you run into someone you used to date, either you find them totally annoying or enough time has passed that you've idealized everything about them.
19046	Danni	Hey, J.D.
19047	J.D.'s Thoughts	"Hey, Jay-Dee!"
19048	J.D.	I'm actually on my way to see somebody, so, you know....
19049	Danni	Oh, okay. I'll see you later.
19050	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, be nice.
19051	J.D.	Danni, wait!
19052	J.D.	How've you been?
19053	Danni	Well, actually, I
19054	J.D.	Ooh! Gotta go!
19055	J.D.'s Narration	And there she was my lady.
19056	J.D.	Hey, Elliot.
19057	Elliot	J.D., I can't talk right now.
19058	J.D.	Should we just hold each other?
19059	Sean	Sorry! Sorry! I couldn't find a parking spot! Heh.
19060	Sean	Hey, J.D. What's up?
19061	J.D.	What's up....
19062	J.D.	Attention, Sacred Heart! Everyone please gather 'round. Doctors, nurses, patients, hear ye, hear ye.
19063	J.D.	Everyone should know that last night, Elliot Reid and I made passionate love for a good hour and a half. Check that! A _great_ hour and a half.
19064	J.D.	When I hit it, I hit it good! That is all!
19065	Carla	Aww, Bambi freeze up again?
19066	Turk	It's not our problem, honey.
19067	Carla	Tsk-aww.
19068	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19069	J.D.	You've got something on your face.
19070	Sean	What?
19071	J.D.'s Thoughts	The love of my life.
19072	J.D.	You got it.
19073	Sean	So, I'll see you after work.
19074	Elliot	'Kay.
19075	Sean	Bye, J.D.
19076	J.D.	Peace out, Sean.
19077	Elliot	Listen, J.D.... Last night was really important to me.
19078	J.D.	I know. I mean, you don't want to be rusty at sex before you throw down with your real boyfriend, do ya?
19079	Elliot	Look, you and I have been down this road before and we both know where it ends.
19080	J.D.	I totally understand. You know, Danni and I are getting back together, too.
19081	J.D.'s Thoughts	We are?
19082	Elliot	Danni? Danni, Danni, Danni.... What was her last name?
19083	J.D.'s Thoughts	Damn! I should know this!
19084	Elliot	Blonde hair!
19085	J.D.	Yes! Raspy voice!
19086	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19087	Dr. Miller	Oh, yeah. That incision's healing up nicely.
19088	Jeff	Thanks again, Dr. Miller. I'm gonna have my band write a song about you.
19089	Dr. Miller	Well, I'm glad I struck a chord!
19090	Dr. Cox	Yeah, listen: While you were proving once and for all that pretty girls do not in fact need to be funny, I went ahead and took a look at your little rock star's chart.
19091	Dr. Miller	Oh, didja?
19092	Dr. Cox	Yes, I did. And his urine output is dropping, so you should probably start him on Lasix.
19093	Dr. Miller	You amuse me. So even though he's post-op and still technically my patient, I'm gonna pretend to consider your opinion before I walk away and do whatever I want!
19094	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19095	&	Are you all right?
19096	Janitor	Some hooligan keeps disconnecting the alarm.
19097	Janitor	I told Security to look into it? But no, no, they'd rather catch the guy who's stealing organs from the transplant ward.
19098	Carla	You really want to be a security guard?
19099	Janitor	Who around here commands more respect than the men who wear blue and green?
19100	Turk	The uniforms are black and gray.
19101	Janitor	You got me. I don't see colors well. Happy now?
19102	Carla	Look, if you're really into Security, Irv's position just opened up!
19103	Janitor	What happened to Irv?
19104	Guy	Tubs?
19105	Irv	Who's tubby now!?!?!
19106	Orderly	Stop him!
19107	Carla	Oh, oh, okay!
19108	Turk	Uh-oh, uh-oh, aggh!
19109	Carla	He had to be let go.
19110	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19111	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, Elliot really hurt me. Still, right now I need to keep a level head. My emotions are all over the place, and it's important that I don't do anything rash.
19112	J.D.	Do you have to do that here?
19113	Danni	What? I like smoking after sex.
19114	J.D.	And during. God, you never used to smoke!
19115	Danni	Yeah, but back then I was pretending to be someone I thought you wanted me to be, and that didn't work. So now....
19116	Danni	...I'm gonna let the real me come out. And the real me wants to do it again...and she wants to do it rough!
19117	J.D.	Oh, I don't know, Danni. The real me's not really into that.
19118	Danni	GIVE IT TO ME!
19119	J.D.	Oh, my God, Danni, I am so sorry. I thought that's what you wanted.
19120	Danni	It was.
19121	J.D.	YAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!
19122	Dr. Cox	Quick question: Will my son ever stop crying?
19123	Jordan	You know what's so sweet? This morning, Jack called her "Da-Da".
19124	Dr. Cox	I'm I'm I'm sorry. Look, there's a new doctor at the hospital, and she is such a relentless chore that every time she's harping at me, I actually see your face.
19125	Jordan	I love that you think about me at work!
19126	Dr. Cox	Honestly, Jordan, I have never despised anyone more.
19127	Jordan	Oh, my God. You have a crush on her.
19128	Dr. Cox	Who said who to what now?
19129	Jordan	It is so _typical_. We have an amazing son, we're totally getting along for a change...but that's too boring for you; it's too nice! So you have to go and blow the whole thing up, don't you? Well, bravo, Perry. Ohh...fantastic!
19130	Dr. Cox	Now, I know you say you love us all equally. But you don't, do ya. I'm onto you, Big Man!
19131	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19132	Dr. Kelso	Okay. This badge is now yours.
19133	Janitor	I just want to thank you for believing in me. And I want to assure you that I am gonna be guarding these hospital gates the way Cerberus guarded the gates of Hell!
19134	Dr. Kelso	Yeah, that's terrific.
19135	Janitor	Uh?
19136	Carla	Look at you in your new uniform! And they give you a nightstick!
19137	Janitor	Well, actually, this is my dad's. He used to use this baby every day at work.
19138	Turk	Was he a cop?
19139	Janitor	Uh, no, cat trainer.
19140	&	Ohhh.
19141	Turk	Meow!
19142	Turk	That way!
19143	Janitor	Shh! You stay here! I'll go!
19144	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19145	J.D.'s Narration	I felt bad about hooking up with Danni. But luckily no one knew.
19146	J.D.	You want any water?
19147	J.D.	Well, do you guys?
19148	Carla	Bambi! We know you were in there with Danni. We heard you say her name!
19149	J.D.	Oh, no, no. I was I was in there with my buddy Danny, from the gym.
19150	Turk	But we heard you say "Take it all, Danni!"
19151	J.D.	He's a...really...good...buddy.
19152	Janitor	Whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Moving a little quick there, aren't we, bub?
19153	Dr. Cox	Here's a story: It's called The Security Guard Who Was Sodomized With His Own Nightstick.
19154	Janitor	Why don't we just consider this a warning.
19155	Dr. Cox	Yeah.
19156	Janitor	My cousin is a bank teller, and he gave me one of those exploding ink cartridges they put in stolen money so I could figure out who's been disconnecting the emergency exits!
19157	Dr. Kelso	Nice work.
19158	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19159	Dr. Miller	Okay, that's all from me, Jeff. Any other questions you might have you can direct to Dr. Cox, here. I'm sure you'll find him to be quite...something!
19160	Dr. Cox	Ha-ha!
19161	Jeff	You think it's cool if I broke out tomorrow and play a set with the band? They're going on tour in Europe and...I won't get a chance to play with them for a whole year.
19162	Dr. Miller	I think we can work something out.
19163	Dr. Miller	Don't worry about it. I will drive him out there myself, he can play with his friends for an hour, and then I'll drive him back.
19164	Dr. Cox	I won't worry about it. Mostly because he's not going. You see, I'm his doctor now.
19165	Dr. Miller	Oh-ho, I didn't listen to you before, so now you're gonna take it out on the patient.
19166	Dr. Cox	Look, I honestly don't think that going to some dive bar is necessarily appropriate for somebody who just had kidney surgery.
19167	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19168	Carla	Bambi, when you broke up with Danni, you said it was the happiest day of your life!
19169	J.D.	No, that was only because 'Barney Miller' came out on DVD.
19170	Turk	And WoJo's commentary on it? Priceless!
19171	J.D.	Look, maybe Danni's not the love of my life, all right? But she's she's beautiful, and she quirky, and she's very...sweet.
19172	Danni	Man, I get so gassy after having sex.
19173	&	Heh.
19174	Danni	Oh, by the way, some skank named Barbara called, and I told her to back off.
19175	J.D.	Barbara's my mom.
19176	J.D.'s Narration	In life, there are personal realizations....
19177	J.D.	I hate my girlfriend.
19178	J.D.'s Narration	....and professional ones.
19179	Dr. Kelso	Listen, Serpico, I go four steps out that door to my car every day. And that's important, because if I don't beat Enid home from her thighs & buns class, I have to help her peel off her leotard. So remember this: I hired you, and I can fire you.
19180	J.D.'s Narration	But the worst are the realizations that sneak up on you.
19181	Dr. Miller	Excuse me, I need to get a, uh
19182	Dr. Cox	Book about supply closet etiquette? Yeah, look, I'm kinda using this area?
19183	Dr. Miller	Oh, oh, you are so annoying; you must drive your wife insane. ...Are you married?
19184	J.D.'s Narration	Like when you realize you just might have a crush after all.
19185	Dr. Cox	No, no I'm not.
19186	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19187	J.D.'s Narration	In a big hospital, you can hide from almost anything. Except your conscience.
19188	Jordan	Hello.
19189	Dr. Cox	Oh, hey! Hey, Jordan! You know what's weird?
19190	Jordan	Tell me.
19191	Dr. Cox	We're so close, and yet if anybody asks if we're married, all either one of us can say is is no.
19192	Jordan	Actually, I say we were married for five years then got divorced, now we're back living together, have a child, but we're in a long-term, committed relationship.
19193	Dr. Cox	Yeah, that's what I say, too.... That or...no.
19194	Jordan	Oh, Mr. Mid-life. We both know what this is about. And you should just go ahead and enjoy your crush! Because, honestly, I don't care. I don't!
19195	Carla	Mm, mm, mm.
19196	Turk	That's sad.
19197	Nurse Roberts	Hey, Q-Tip! Some girl who says she's your girlfriend is on the phone!
19198	J.D.	Oh, uh, tell her I'm not here.
19199	&	Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.
19200	Janitor	Godspeed, sir.
19201	&	Mm, mm, mm.

19205	J.D.	Hey, you wanna play darts?
19206	Danni	Sure!
19207	J.D.	Great! Have fun, I'll be over here.
19208	Danni	Do you even enjoy spending time with me?
19209	J.D.	"Enjoy" is such a strong word.... I...I'm used to it. You know, like cafeteria food, or the constant threat of terrorism.
19210	Danni	Not really. I'm more into tough guys, you know?
19211	J.D.	Last night in bed, I knocked you unconscious!
19212	Danni	For like _five seconds_!
19213	J.D.	So I guess...this is over.
19214	Danni	Why?
19215	J.D.	So, you'd rather hang out with someone you don't even like than be alone?
19216	Danni	Yeah, pretty much.
19217	J.D.	Yeah, me too. I mean, come on, how many couples out there actually have fun together?
19218	Sean	Guys! Elliot and I are in the middle of a marathon game of Hide & Go Seek. If she comes in, you didn't see me!
19219	Elliot	Ninety-nine! One hundred! Have you guys seen Sean?
19220	J.D.	Yeah, he's
19221	J.D.	Where'd he go?
19222	J.D.'s Thoughts	Aw, he's a dynamite hider.
19223	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19224	&	Mm, mm, mmm, mmm, mmm.
19225	Dr. Cox	Oh, don't even start, Tarla, or Curk, or whatever you're calling this little two-headed judgmental freak-show. Why don't I do a little piece for you I like to call Your First Year of Marriage: "I do." Oh, kiss, kiss, kiss. "Why can't we have a baby?" "Why you spending so much money on clothes?" "Why you sleeping with my sister?" "Why can't I hang out with my peeps?"
19226	Turk	Baby.
19227	Carla	Hmm?
19228	Turk	I would never sleep with your sister. She's hideous.
19229	Carla	And I would _never_ have a crush on someone else.
19230	Dr. Cox	I do not have a crush.
19231	Carla	What is this?
19232	Dr. Cox	That is a form allowing Mr. Stockton's band to come visit him so that Dr. Miller will be happy that I did a nice thing for her. Ehhhh!
19233	Carla	Turk, he wants to be with Dr. Miller because he thinks it'll make him what?
19234	Turk	Happy.
19235	Carla	Exactly. But he's really only happy when he's...?
19236	Turk	Miserable.
19237	Carla	Right! So why does he really want to be with Dr. Miller?
19238	Turk	'Cause she got big-ass boobies!
19239	Carla	No, no, no. Because he likes being miserable.
19240	Dr. Cox	If I actually enjoyed being miserable, then why wouldn't I stay here talking to you two?
19241	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19242	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, let's see how Elliot likes it when I'm all over my lady?
19243	J.D.	Hey, I've got something for you.
19244	Danni	What?
19245	Danni	Okay, I'm gonna buy the next round. Which one of you handsome boys wanna help me carry it?
19246	Sean	We're both good-looking guys, am I right? We'll sort this out when I get back!
19247	J.D.	Okay, sort away, Seany-Sean-Sean!
19248	J.D.	Oh, my God!
19249	J.D.	How could you do this to me?
19250	Elliot	Do...what?
19251	J.D.	Ohh, I don't know! Come over my house, sleep with me, and then dump me the minute Sean shows up so I feel like a complete loser!
19252	Elliot	Oh, you seem real crushed! I mean, you jumped into bed with Danni so quick you didn't have time to change the sheets!
19253	J.D.	You know I only have one set.
19254	Elliot	Look, J.D., can I ask you a favor?
19255	J.D.	Could I ask you one?
19256	Elliot	Sure, anything. What is it?
19257	J.D.'s Thoughts	Damn, I don't have one.
19258	Elliot	Didn't have one, did ya?
19259	J.D.	Look, Elliot! What do you want!?

19262	Dr. Miller	Why'd you page me? What do you want?
19263	Dr. Cox	Just, uh...just watch his face.
19264	Jeff	No way.
19265	Bandmate	How you feeling?
19266	Jeff	Hey, Rick!
19267	Bandmate	Hi!
19268	Jeff	Audrey! Ryan! Tim! Jamie! Tobey!
19269	Bandmate	Hey, Jeff!
19270	Jeff	Joe!
19271	Dr. Cox	I hope this won't be awkward for ya, but I promised the whole band you'd have sex with them.
19272	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19273	Janitor	Don't look at me like that! This is your fault, anyway! You two made me dream again.
19274	Turk	Hey, we weren't the ones who caved in to Kelso.
19275	Janitor	I do not owe you an explanation for that!
19276	Carla	You're right, you don't owe us an explanation!
19277	Turk	Lay some truth on him, baby!
19278	Carla	You owe one to yourself.
19279	Turk	Ouch.
19280	Carla	Now I'm gonna let my husband-to-be tell you what life's really all about, because he has more of this than any man I know.
19281	Turk	Archie comics?
19282	Carla	No, the other thing.
19283	Turk	Oh, that's right integrity.
19284	Carla	Oh. Here's your chance!
19285	J.D.'s Narration	I was so mad at Elliot I couldn't sleep last night. Also, Danni snores like a gutted wild boar. But mostly it was the Elliot thing.
19286	Sean	Hey, J.D. Can I talk to you for a sec?
19287	Sean	Look, things have been a little weird between Elliot and I since I got back.
19288	J.D.'s Thoughts	Good.
19289	Sean	J.D., listen. Did anything happen between you and Elliot while I was gone?
19290	J.D.	Sorry, everybody. False alarm.
19291	Crowd	Awwww.
19292	Sean	Well?
19293	J.D.'s Narration	There comes a time when every man has to make a choice. Whether it's a professional choice...
19294	Dr. Kelso	Come on! What are you gonna do about it?
19295	J.D.'s Narration	Or whether it's a personal choice.
19296	Dr. Miller	Hey. Wanna go for a beer after the show?
19297	J.D.'s Narration	In the end, it's about integrity.
19298	Turk	Oh!
19299	Carla	Yes!
19300	Turk	No!
19301	Carla	No!
19302	J.D.'s Narration	And it's about chasing after what you really want.
19303	Dr. Cox	Here's your beer.
19304	J.D.'s Narration	Even if that means showing you both care a little.
19305	Dr. Cox	Did you...did you do that for me?
19306	Jordan	I thought it'd be fun. See, now there are two blondes you can't have sex with!
19307	Dr. Cox	I don't care! It is so naughty!
19308	Jordan	Hah.
19309	Dr. Cox	Cheers.
19310	J.D.'s Narration	And sometimes...well, sometimes you just have to do what's right for your friend.
19311	J.D.	No. Sean, nothing happened.
19312	Sean	Yeah, I figured. Good talk!
19313	Sean	Hey!
19314	Elliot	Hey.
19315	J.D.'s Narration	Even if it means sacrificing your own happiness.
19316	Danni	Giddyup, Dr. Dorkian!
19317	J.D.'s Narration	When it comes down to it, you just have to be proud of the decision you make.
19318	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19319	J.D.'s Narration	In some ways, Dr. Cox and Dr. Kelso are a lot like an old married couple.
19320	Dr. Kelso	I need your opinion about something.
19321	Dr. Cox	Yes, Bob, those pants do make you look like you're holding water.
19322	Dr. Kelso	Perry, I'll tell you the same thing I told a comic I once saw at a strip club in Reno I'm not here for the jokes.
19323	Dr. Cox	Color me intrigued, Bob.
19324	Dr. Kelso	I am considering offering full body scans here at Sacred Heart. What do you think?
19325	Dr. Cox	I think showing perfectly healthy people every harmless imperfection in their body just to scare them into taking invasive and often pointless tests is an unholy sin.
19326	Dr. Kelso	Does sound a little sketchy ethically, doesn't it? Thanks, Perry.
19327	Dr. Cox	Did that just happen? Anybody?
19328	J.D.'s Narration	Me, I was stuck at a couples-only dinner party. There were the soon-to-be newlyweds....
19329	J.D.'s Narration	There were the girl that I loved and the guy trying to eat her face....
19330	J.D.'s Narration	And then there's Danni....
19331	Danni	You know what I was thinking?
19332	J.D.	Nobody cares, Danni.
19333	Carla	Aww, this has been fun, but I have to drive Turk back to the hospital.
19334	Sean	Yeah, and I gotta get up early and look for an apartment.
19335	Elliot	Yeah, he wouldn't take this perfect one he saw today just 'cause the last tenant died there.
19336	Sean	Elliot! Rats ate his tongue out!
19337	Elliot	Yeah, but the kitchen was so cute!
19338	Sean	Oh, please.
19339	J.D.	Hey, Turk! Where're you guys gonna live after you get married?
19340	Carla	You mean where _you_ gonna live.
19341	Turk	Baby, not now. Don't know yet!
19342	J.D.	Guess it's just the two of us.
19343	Danni	You wanna have sex?
19344	J.D.	I guess.
19345	Danni	Do I have to look at you?
19346	J.D.	Please don't.
19347	Danni	Shut up.
19348	Dr. Cox	I can't believe Kelso really asked my opinion. You know?
19349	Janitor	Look, pal, if I wanted to sit and listen to someone yammer on about their lives, I'd be at my AA meeting right now.
19350	Dr. Cox	Listen, there, scrub-brush, it just so happens it was the only empty seat in the whole joint. And besides, as a fellow abusive drinker, you are honor bound by barstool protocol to listen to every last word out of my mouth.
19351	Janitor	Go.
19352	Dr. Cox	Kelso.... Kelso really listened to me about this whole full body scan thing.
19353	Patron	I was thinking about getting one of those scans.
19354	Dr. Cox	What did he say?
19355	Girl	Mommy? When's daddy coming home?
19356	Mother	He isn't. If only he'd loved us enough to get a full body scan at Sacred Heart!
19357	Dr. Cox	Holy cow!
19358	Janitor	Black label.
19359	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19360	Turk	Oh, my goodness! I totally kicked that hernia's ass!
19361	Dr. Miller	Nicely done, as usual, Dr. Turk.
19362	Todd	Dude. Why is Hot Doc being so nice to you lately?
19363	Turk	I don't know, but it's about time. I haven't had to work this hard to win someone over since Carla's mom.
19364	Todd	I thought Carla's mom hated you?
19365	Turk	Yeah, but she died, so I'm counting it as a win.
19366	Dr. Miller	I bought a killer dress for your wedding yesterday. Ooh! Speaking of which, it's only two weeks away. Has your bride-to-be started freaking out yet?
19367	Turk	No, Carla's not the "freak out" type.
19368	J.D.'s Narration	Turk didn't realize that everyone has their moments when emotions run high.
19369	Carla	TURK!
19370	Dr. Cox	KELSOOOOO!
19371	Danni	Oh, Danni!
19372	J.D.	Turk!
19373	Dr. Cox	Kelso!
19374	J.D.	Danni!
19375	Danni	Turk!
19376	Turk	Carla!?
19377	J.D.	Not here.
19378	Turk	Danni!
19379	Danni	I'm gonna go put some clothes on. After all, I am a lady.
19380	Danni	Oh, by the way, I used your razor to shave my pits.
19381	J.D.	Keep it.
19382	J.D.	Dude, Danni did the weirdest thing last night she called out her own name during sex.
19383	Turk	That is weird. Why are we whispering?
19384	J.D.	Because she hears like a bat.
19385	Turk	Bats hear really well?
19386	J.D.	Yeah, 'cause they can't see.
19387	Turk	Oh, yeah, that's right, sonar. Wait a second, that's whales!
19388	J.D.	No, no, no, no, no. Bats and whales, bats and whales!
19389	Turk	Okay, okay, okay.
19390	J.D.	Anyway, I have to break up with her.
19391	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, just let her down easy.
19392	J.D.	Danni, I'm not sure how to do this but, uh...I just don't think we should see each other anymore.
19393	Danni	Cool. I'm already kinda sleeping with this guy named Danny, anyway.
19394	Turk	Whoa! I guess she wasn't calling out her own name after all!
19395	J.D.	You know what! I don't even care, you know why? Because I bet she's calling out my name while she's sleeping with him!
19396	Danni	No, I don't!
19397	J.D.	See, like a bat, dude! Like a bat!
19398	Turk	Check.
19399	J.D.	Aaaaaaaaagh!
19400	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19401	J.D.'s Narration	It actually wasn't that awkward breaking up with Danni.
19402	Danni	Good morning, world!
19403	J.D.'s Thoughts	She seems almost peaceful....
19404	Danni	Later, butt-licks!
19405	J.D.'s Thoughts	Maybe not.
19406	J.D.	Oh, just make sure you got all your things out of my bedroom, okay?
19407	Danni	I put all my stuff at Danny's house three days ago.
19408	Turk	Crunchberry, wrong pipe.
19409	J.D.	Mmm.
19410	Danni	Hey, J.D., don't come chasing after me like you do with Elliot. Because if there's one thing everyone knows about John Dorian, it's that he always wants what he can't have.
19411	J.D.	That's not true, is it?
19412	Turk	Hell no.
19413	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19414	Sean	It's so hard to make myself look for an apartment when I'm sharing my bed with the most beautiful girl in the world.
19415	J.D.	Really, what's his name?
19416	J.D.'s Thoughts	That made absolutely no sense, so just keep sipping.
19417	Elliot	Come on, Sean. I want you to meet this patient, Tommy. He's only five, but he's got like the voice of a grown man.
19418	Sean	Yeah, he?
19419	Elliot	Tommy, what are you doing out of your room?
19420	Tommy	I go where I want.
19421	Sean	Awesome!
19422	Elliot	Yessss!

19424	Carla	Turk!
19425	Turk	Hm?
19426	Carla	Everything's wrong again!
19427	Turk	Baby, it's cool. We're meeting with the cake guy tomorrow.
19428	Carla	Nothing's cool! Nothing's cool!
19429	Turk	Okay, okay
19430	Carla	The centerpieces are supposed to be cupids, but they have no arrows, so now they're just fat babies. I have 187 people who RSVP'd "yes" for a 125-seat wedding. Plus, I have to wear my grandmother's choker, but with my hair up it makes me look like one of those African tribeswomen with a coil around my neck!
19431	Turk	Okay, first of all, you best be nice to my cousin, Mfume. Second, baby, if we have too many guests, you can un-invite some people.
19432	Carla	Really?
19433	Turk	Really. It'll be fine.
19434	Carla	Okay.
19435	Turk	Close your eyes.
19436	Carla	Okay.
19437	Turk	Take a deep breath.
19438	Turk	See how good that feels? Now take another one.
19439	Turk	Take another one.
19440	Carla	Are you watching my boobs?

19444	Dr. Kelso	Ah, thank you, Shirley.
19445	Dr. Cox	Dammit all to hell, Bob! I cannot _believe_ you're gonna turn this hospital into some money-making machine that coerces people into spending their hard-earned cash on expensive procedures that they don't even need!
19446	Dr. Kelso	Why not? It sounds like something I'd do.
19447	Dr. Cox	You mark my words, if one single person gets a full body scan, I will...I will kiss your ring.
19448	Dr. Kelso	I'll take that bet, champ! You're our witness, Laverne.
19449	Nurse Roberts	How very exciting for all of us.
19450	Dr. Cox	I'm not even sweatin'! Because, honest to God, what kind of gullible chump would go ahead and spend a thousand dollars on some silly scan if he's feeling perfectly fine?
19451	Mr. Corman	Hello, Laverne! Shirle!
19452	Dr. Cox	Oh.
19453	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19454	J.D.	How's the chicken today?
19455	Carla	Oh, my God! Turk! What if someone's vegetarian!? I gotta go call the caterer!
19456	Turk	Thank you. I just calmed her down.
19457	J.D.	She's quite mad, you know. I hope she doesn't rub off on you.
19458	Todd	Oh! Too easy.
19459	Turk	Please, man. I'm Christopher Duncan Turk.
19460	Todd	Duncan?
19461	J.D.	His dad loved doughnuts.
19462	Turk	That's not true. Okay, you really need to stop saying that. The point is, I don't lose my cool.
19463	J.D.	I don't know. Remember back in college, when we had tickets to see Michael Jordan in the playoffs?
19464	Turk	We're goin' to see Michael Jordan! We're goin' to see Michael Jordan! We're goin' to see Michael Jordan! 'Cause we got good tickets! We went five hundred miles
19465	J.D.	Hey, was I supposed to bring the tickets or the sandwiches?
19466	J.D.	Oh, God.
19467	Turk	OH! NO! Leave it on the floor! You leave it on the floor!
19468	J.D.	You shaved your head for the first time after that.
19469	Danni	Wanting what you can't have.
19470	J.D.	Why are you here? Hospitals don't sell cigarettes!
19471	Todd	Man, I'd smoke her.
19472	J.D.	Quiet time, Todd.

19474	Mr. Corman	I wanna know everything that's wrong with me.
19475	Dr. Cox	Mr. Corman, you're not even feeling bad! You don't need this scan! If it would make you happy, we can just go ahead and do the exact same thing we've done the last fifty times you've been in here take your temperature, draw some blood, and give you a rectal. It's your basic "Ah, Ow, OH!"
19476	Mr. Corman	Why should I even listen to you? The last time I was here, you tried to torture me to prove a point. Dr. Dr. Dr.
19477	Dr. Cox	Cox.
19478	Mr. Corman	Mengele!
19479	Dr. Cox	Uh!
19480	Mr. Corman	Now, if you will excuse me, I've already talked to the insurance company, so there is nothing you can say that can stop me from doing this!
19481	Dr. Cox	Now, Mr. Corman, apparently your insurance company's not gonna cover it.
19482	Mr. Corman	Good day to you, sir.

19484	Turk	I'm ready to make the first incision.

19487	Dr. Miller	More than anything in the world.
19488	Todd	Thank you!
19489	Turk	Oh, man!
19490	Dr. Miller	Now this is your big shot, so if you don't want me to throw you out of here, you've gotta get through this whole procedure without making a single sex joke.
19491	Todd	No problem.
19492	Dr. Miller	All right, to really get at this, I think we need to go in from behind.

Oooh, the last second, something might oooh oooh oooh!" Come on! Enough already! I mean, you guys aren't exactly Ross and Rachel.
19499	J.D.	Who?
19500	Janitor	Dr. Ross, and Rachel from Bookkeeping.
19501	J.D.	Mmm.
19502	Janitor	Why don't you just let her be happy with...stunningly handsome, full-lipped guy.
19503	J.D.	You know, I I don't even care what you think.
19504	J.D.'s Narration	In the heat of battle, it's important to hold your ground.
19505	Mr. Corman	Doctor.
19506	Dr. Cox	Well, now, Bobbo, you hooked him, you got him in the boat, but he still got away!
19507	J.D.'s Narration	Because victory can be snatched away at the last second.
19508	Dr. Kelso	Mr. Corman, your full body scan is on the house.
19509	Mr. Corman	I'm listening.
19510	Dr. Miller	Excuse me.
19511	Turk	Mm-hmm.
19512	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes you don't even know how it happened.
19513	Turk	Baby, I don't get it. Last night I was the golden boy, and now I'm fat flap guy. Why would Dr. Miller turn on me? I've been great in surgery, I've been nice to her...she's coming to the wedding!
19514	Carla	No, she's not.
19515	Turk	What?
19516	Carla	I un-invited her.
19517	J.D.'s Narration	Yep, it's amazing how your world can change in an instant.
19518	Elliot	You guys! Guess what. I just asked Sean if he would move in with me and...tell 'em what you said!
19519	Sean	"Yes!"
19520	Elliot	Isn't that great!
19521	Janitor	That _is_ great! Isn't that great?

19528	Mr. Corman	Thanks for the lift. Because, for some reason on Tuesdays, my feet just swell up like Jiffy Pop bags. I'm sure it'll show up on the scan. Oh, if anything turns up green, it's probably an emerald that I swallowed from my mother's jewelry box when I was five. Gee, I'd like to get that back to her....
19529	Mr. Corman	Hey, what's going on?
19530	Dr. Cox	Zip it. I know a shortcut.
19531	Mr. Corman	Help! I'm getting chair-jacked!
19532	Carla	Okay, why are you mad? You told me to un-invite people!
19533	Turk	So, without asking, you went to my new boss and told her you didn't want her to come to the wedding.
19534	Carla	Nooo. I told her _we_ didn't want her to come.
19535	Nurse Roberts	Well, hello there. Can I give you some help?
19536	Tommy	My mommy said you had lollipops. Gimme a red one!
19537	J.D.	So, moving in together, huh?
19538	Elliot	Yeah.... It's a little scary.
19539	J.D.'s Narration	And just like that I saw my window.
19540	J.D.	It _is_ scary! You know, I knew this girl in college who moved in with her boyfriend? Everything changed stopped talking to each other, started fighting all the time and...you know the rest.
19541	Elliot	They broke up?
19542	J.D.	Oh, no, he killed her.
19543	Nurse	Dr. Reid? They need you to check on that stabbing victim in Room 301?
19544	J.D.	Could be you!
19545	Elliot	What?
19546	J.D.	Nothing.
19547	Sean	Don't do that.
19548	J.D.	Why are you here, Sean?
19549	Sean	Elliot listens to you, J.D. Why are you messing with her head?
19550	Danni	It's 'cause he wants what he can't have.
19551	J.D.	Okay, new rule! Hospitals are for doctors and sick people only! Okay?
19552	Sean	Look, J.D., you've had so many chances, and you never stepped up to the plate. Me, I'm terrified, but I'm going for it because that's how much Elliot and I mean to each other. We work. So if you really care about her, you won't mess this up.
19553	Turk	Un-invite my boss, huh? Well, we'll see how she likes it when I mess with her world, huh?

19555	Mr. Corman	Listen, I appreciate the lunch. But are you actually trying to convince me, an admittedly frugal hypochondriac, not to get a free full body scan?
19556	Dr. Cox	Mr. Corman, you're not dying of anything! Although if you do try to swipe one more bite of my lamb medallions I will be forced to kill you.
19557	Mr. Corman	Well, look who never learned to share.
19558	Dr. Cox	Listen to me! I am not losing a bet to Bob Kelso!
19559	Mr. Corman	All this concern about my _health_ and my _well-being_, and it's about a _bet_!? You know what, that's a pretty reprehensible thing to do! Well, if you'll excuse me, I have a full body scan to take!
19560	Mr. Corman	You drove me here.

19564	Carla	Oh, it's perfect! Isn't it Turk?
19565	Turk	What's up with the white people on top?
19566	Carla	Turk, they don't have tiny plastic interracial couples.
19567	Baker	I'll just color it in with some chocolate frosting.
19568	Turk	Oh, that's a great idea. Put 'em in blackface.
19569	Carla	Turk!
19570	Turk	What? While you're at it, why don't you put a string in the back of him, so when you pull it he sings "Mammy"!
19571	Baker	Forget it.
19572	Turk	Where're you going? To the back of the bakery where you keep all the other colored cakes? I'ma call Jesse! And we gonna march on your ass!

19577	Elliot	Thanks, J.D. I...really needed to hear that from you.
19578	J.D.'s Thoughts	Maybe it's true that I'm someone who only wants what he can't have. But what if the thing I want is the girl I'm supposed to end up with?
19579	J.D.	It should be me.
19580	Elliot	What?
19581	J.D.	Look, Elliot: Every year we bounce around this thing, and I never have the courage to stand up and tell you how I feel. I'm crazy about you. And I want you to know if I had the choice of hanging around with anyone in the entire world or staying at home with you, eating pizza and watching a crappy TV show, I'd choose you every time.
19582	Elliot	I.... Um.... I have to go.

19584	Dr. Cox	Not yet, you don't.
19585	Mr. Corman	For Pete's sake.... Will you leave me alone?
19586	Dr. Cox	Look! This baby would mess with a normal person's mind. So please hear me when I say that if you get this scan, it will ruin you. The next year of your life is gonna be a series of endless tests, and I'll do whatever it takes to keep that from happening to you. Even if it means giving you free medical treatment the rest of your life.
19587	Mr. Corman	How can I believe that you even care about me?
19588	Dr. Kelso	How are we doing, Mr. Corman?
19589	Dr. Cox	Oh, uh, Bob. We, uh, we just had our scan. You win.
19590	Dr. Kelso	And...?
19591	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19592	Dr. Kelso	Now, Perry, I know that was our first date, but next time, don't be afraid to put a little feeling into it.
19593	Dr. Cox	There you go. It's damn sure not about the bet anymore. You do whatever you want.
19594	Turk	I cannot believe you are freaking out about this! It's a great idea!
19595	Carla	Turk! We are not having wedding PIE!
19596	Turk	That is so typical of you, Carla! This whole wedding has been about you, and I'll prove it!
19597	Carla	Give me back my wedding planner!
19598	Turk	Frank Sinatra as our first dance. Please, baby, that guy has only got one good song. You got...pink roses. I hate pink! Big screen TV at the reception! Big screen TV at the reception?
19599	Carla	I knew how much you wanted to see the play-offs.
19600	Turk	You did that for me?
19601	J.D.'s Narration	It's amazing how one simple gesture can bring you back from the brink.
19602	Sean	Hey! So, U-Haul is parked outside, everything I own is in there. Well, except for this half of my salad tongs, but I-I was using it to scratch myself on the way over.
19603	Elliot	This isn't gonna work.
19604	J.D.'s Narration	I guess the funny thing about love is you never know how things are gonna work out.
19605	J.D.'s Narration	Like me. I lost Elliot. But at least I went down swinging.
19606	J.D.	Elliot? What are you doing?
19607	Elliot	What are we watching?
19608	J.D.	'Little House on the Prairie.'
19609	Elliot	Mm.
19610	Dr. Kelso	If you're wondering what this is, Perry, it's a list of the hundreds of people who've already signed up for our full body scan.
19611	Dr. Cox	Well, bully for you, there, Bobbo.
19612	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes the smallest victory is enough to get you through the day.
19613	Mr. Corman	I didn't get the scan.
19614	Dr. Cox	I know you didn't, Mr. Corman.
19615	Mr. Corman	Please, call me Harvey.
19616	Dr. Cox	"Harvey Corman"?
19617	Mr. Corman	Doesn't get me as much action as you'd think.
19618	Dr. Cox	...Just in case. Heh.
19619	Carla	Do you want me to re-invite her?
19620	Turk	Do you want her there?
19621	Carla	No. She's too pretty. I want people looking at me.
19622	Turk	Okay, she's out.
19623	Dr. Miller	Dr. Turk. Meet me in the O.R.
19624	Turk	Fat flaps?
19625	Dr. Miller	You got it!
19626	Turk	I love fat flaps.
19627	Carla	I love _you_!
19628	J.D.'s Narration	As for me, all I needed was Elliot.
19629	Elliot	J.D., it's just so weird. I mean, my whole future was right there in front of me, and I just walked away. All because of you.
19630	J.D.	Well, I think you made the right choice.
19631	J.D.'s Narration	I think that the problem with most people who want what they can't have is that, when they actually get the thing they covet, they don't want it anymore. But not this guy.
19632	Elliot	Well, Dr. Dorian, you have me. You finally have me.
19633	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, my God! I DON'T WANT HER!
19634	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19635	J.D.'s Thoughts	I'm a sick man. Last night, after three years of chasing Elliot, I convinced her to dump her perfect boyfriend and then immediately realized I don't want her. What the hell's wrong with me?
19636	J.D.	Ooh! Ooh! Ooog!
19637	J.D.'s Thoughts	An _incredibly_ heavy sleeper.
19638	J.D.	Wow.
19639	J.D.'s Thoughts	I knew I needed to talk this over with someone who understood me. Someone I had recently been intimate with.
19640	Larry	Yeah?
19641	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, not him.
19642	Danni	J.D., this is Larry. Larry, this is J.D.
19643	Larry	I think I'll go put on some underwear.
19644	J.D.	Please, Larry!
19645	J.D.	What the hell you doing with that guy?
19646	Danni	I don't know. I thought it'd be cool to date a celebrity.
19647	J.D.	He's not a celebrity!
19648	J.D.'s Thoughts	Wait a second!
19649	J.D.	Are you the Soup Nazi from 'Seinfeld'?
19650	Larry	No.
19651	J.D.	Say the soup thing.
19652	Larry	No!
19653	J.D.	Dammit!
19654	Carla	Turk! We're getting married tomorrow!
19655	Turk	Yeah....
19656	Carla	Why aren't you excited?
19657	Turk	'Cause, baby, we've been here for an hour and you've already said it like thirteen times.
19658	Carla	But we're getting married tomorrow!!!!
19659	Carla	Have you been working on your vows?
19660	Turk	Define "work."
19661	Carla	It's the difference between special birthday sex and _no sex_ on our wedding night.
19662	Turk	Yeah, I do like the special birthday sex.
19663	Carla	Turk, when I asked you if you wanted to write your own vows, you said yes.
19664	Turk	Baby, I'm on top of it, all right? I promise you this weekend'll go off without a hitch!
19665	Carla	Oh, hey, how did it go picking up my brother at the airport this morning?
19666	Turk	I'm sorry, what?
19667	Carla	How could you forget him!? You two have enough trouble getting along as it is!
19668	Turk	Baby, I'm joking!
19669	Carla	Aww.
19670	Turk	Hey, Marco! The invites said no dates!
19671	Turk	No da ....
19672	J.D.	Look, Danni, the reason I'm here is well, first of all I wanted to give you back your skull lighter.
19673	J.D.	Secondly, you always seem to have some insight in to why I'm so messed up. I mean here I-I chase after Elliot for three years, now I don't want her!
19674	Danni	Well maybe it's 'cause you idealize women and no one can live up to your standards.
19675	J.D.	Why would I idealize women?
19676	Danni	What's your mom like?
19677	J.D.'s Mom	I love you, honey. You're the smartest, handsomest, sweetest boy in the whole world. And no matter how hard you look, you will never find a woman who'll love you as much as I do.
19678	Little J.D.	I know, Mommy.
19679	J.D.	My mom is perfect.
19680	Larry	Look, kid, you're just confused. All you need to do is focus on the little things you love about her. Like...the way she puts out a cigarette...or how when she finishes a beer, she looks inside the can just to check if there's any left.
19681	J.D.	Hm?
19682	Danni	Sweetie, it's 5 to 9, and my Denver omelet's not gonna make itself.
19683	J.D.	It's 5 to 9?! I gotta go!
19684	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, he is so the Soup Nazi! Trick him!
19685	J.D.	What is it again? It's like, you're out of luck in the soup department?
19686	Larry	NO SOUP FOR YOU!
19687	J.D.	Ha! Rad.
19688	J.D.	Oooog! Ow!
19689	Elliot	What are you doing?
19690	J.D.	Just lying here, watching you sleep.
19691	Elliot	Awww.
19692	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19693	J.D.'s Thoughts	I don't think my hang-up with Elliot has anything to do with my sexy, amazing mom. And I'm not that much of a commitophobe. Maybe I just don't feel I deserve someone as great as Elliot because I have low self-esteem.
19694	Elliot	Do you know that you have really nice hands?
19695	J.D.	"Nice"? Elliot, these are the hands of a god!
19696	Elliot	Heh!
19697	J.D.'s Thoughts	Fine, so it's not the self-esteem thing.
19698	J.D.'s Narration	Then Elliot and I got to witness an event that many had spoken of, but none had ever seen.
19699	Elliot	The arrival of the janitors!
19700	J.D.	Morning!
19701	Janitor	Is it? Is it really?
19702	J.D.	No, I was I was kidding.
19703	Another Janitor	I'd stay out of his way today. He just lost the election for union president.
19704	J.D.	Who won?
19705	Yet Another Janitor	Congratulations, sir.
19706	And Another Janitor	Hey.
19707	Randall	Welcome to work, boys! Be the best janitors you can be today!
19708	Randall	No hard feelings, brah.
19709	Janitor	Oh, there's hard feelings.
19710	Janitor	Grrrrrrrrrrr...hah! Eh?
19711	Randall	All right.
19712	Janitor	Nyah! What the? Oh! It's like a mechanical vice!
19713	Another Janitor	Change is good.
19714	Dr. Cox	Sweetheart, I slept like a log.
19715	Jordan	Really. See, I didn't notice, 'cause I was up all night with Jack.
19716	Dr. Cox	Tell me this: How do you not scare him when you go in there? Do you wear a nanny mask, or do you just slap on a nametag that says "Hi, I'm your mommy"?
19717	Jordan	I refuse to be judged by a grown man wearing a hockey jersey.
19718	Dr. Cox	Say the word and I'll go out and buy a whole new wardrobe; and to pay for it we'll just sell one of your shoes!
19719	Jordan	Great! We made him cry!
19720	Jordan	If we keep this up, we're gonna scar him for life!
19721	Dr. Cox	I don't necessarily buy into all that new agey crap. One time I saw my mom knock my father unconscious with a frying pan. You know what I did? I kept right on going with my birthday party.
19722	Jordan	I am not fighting with you anymore. Ever!
19723	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19724	Billy Crystal	How 'bout this way: I love that you get cold when it's seventy-one degrees out. I love that it takes you an hour and a half to order a sandwich. I love that you get a little crinkle above your nose when you're looking at me like I'm nuts. I love that after I spend a day with you, I can still smell your perfume on my clothes. And I love that you are
19725	Marco	TuPac! I was watching that!
19726	Turk	Dude! I gotta do my vows!
19727	Marco	Oh, come on, man! That was 'When Harry Met Sally' it was a classic!
19728	Turk	Oh, yeah, dude! You know, I was gonna rent that the other night, but then I remembered I'm a heterosexual.
19729	Carla	Too bad you couldn't remember to go to the airport.
19730	Turk	You told her?
19731	Carla	Yes, Turk, he did.
19732	&	Love.
19733	Carla	No! ME!
19734	&	Okay.
19735	Marco	Idiot.
19736	Turk	Tattletale.
19737	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19738	Janitor	Get outta my face.
19739	J.D.	What?
19740	Janitor	I'm just saying the next person that gets in my face is gonna wish they hadn't.
19741	J.D.'s Thoughts	Sociopath!
19742	Elliot	Catch me, stud!
19743	Elliot	You know, most guys woulda caught me. I love that you didn't!
19744	J.D.	Oh! Cool!
19745	J.D.'s Thoughts	Maybe Elliot's just not the right fit for me. I mean, I'm the kinda guy who likes stupid movies.
19746	Elliot	Hey, let's rent 'Kangaroo Jack' tonight!
19747	J.D.'s Thoughts	And I have uncontrollable hostility towards small rodents.
19748	Elliot	Or we could just go shoot rats at the dump!
19749	J.D.'s Thoughts	Dammit, she's perfect on paper! What the hell's wrong with me?
19750	J.D.	What?
19751	Elliot	Nothing. I just love the way you drift off in your head sometimes.
19752	J.D.'s Thoughts	I guess the Soup Nazi was right, it is the little things that are important.
19753	J.D.'s Thoughts	Or how she's the only person I know who sneezes with her eyes open.
19754	Elliot	Atchoo. Ahem. 'Scuse me.
19755	J.D.'s Narration	And that's when I realized that I really liked all those things about Elliot, but I didn't love them...and I didn't love her.
19756	Elliot	You're the best.
19757	Elliot	See you later.
19758	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, boy.
19759	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19760	Jordan	Oh, my God! That board meeting went on forever! It was so dull, I had to read pamphlets just to stay awake. Good news is? Don't have testicular cancer.
19761	Dr. Cox	Tell me, did ya happen to come across any pamphlets on people who only work eight days a year and then spend the other 357 whining about it?
19762	Jordan	What part of "I'm not fighting with you anymore" do you not get? If you want someone to fight with, you have to find someone else. Mm-hmm.
19763	Dr. Cox	Oh, good. Here you're wetting down the floor for the older folks.
19764	Janitor	Please say that you're talking to me.
19765	Dr. Cox	I don't see anybody else around, soap jockey.
19766	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19767	Marco	Mmm! Oh. Oh.
19768	Turk	Chew louder.
19769	J.D.	Turk, I need your help, man. It's about Elliot.
19770	Marco	Why, did you sleep with her again?
19771	J.D.	How does everybody know about this?
19772	J.D.	You're a very loud chewer.
19773	Turk	Dude, I would love to help right now, but I'm in the middle of writing my vows. And all I've got so far is, "Let's give it up for the caterers! WOO! Good chicken!"
19774	J.D.	So now that you're gettin' married, it's all about you.
19775	Turk	No, now that I'm getting married _tomorrow_, it's about me.
19776	Marco	Ooh, still seems that you can take a minute for a friend.
19777	J.D.	I know!
19778	Turk	Shut up, Marco!
19779	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19780	Janitor	That was a mistake.
19781	Dr. Cox	Why's that? Because you're afraid you can't take me?
19782	Janitor	Nnnooo. It's 'cause of this. Boys!
19783	Janitor	You know where to take him.
19784	Dr. Cox	Where to take me?
19785	Dr. Cox	Wait, who's taking me wh ? Maintenance? Maintenance? Uh-oh. We-hey. ___ now. The maintenance brothers!
19786	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19787	Carla	That was Father Paul. He said we can't read our own vows, we have to use the same Catholic ones like everyone else.
19788	Turk	No!
19789	Carla	Yeah.
19790	Turk	Noooo!
19791	Carla	Yeeeah.
19792	Turk	Aw, baby, Carla, that sucks. 'Cause you know, I was gonna totally blow you away.
19793	Marco	Since you guys worked so hard, why don't you just read 'em at the rehearsal dinner tonight?
19794	Carla	That's a fantastic idea!
19795	Carla	Isn't it, Turk?
19796	Turk	Super!
19797	Carla	Awesome! I'm gonna go work on them some more.
19798	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19799	J.D.'s Narration	Unfortunately for me, I wasn't in love with Elliot. But I'm a man, and even though it was gonna be tough, I knew exactly what I had to do.
19800	J.D.	Ready to go? I say we pick up some Chinese and hang at home tonight.
19801	Elliot	Awesome!
19802	J.D.'s Narration	I was going to stay with her for the rest of my life.
19803	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19804	J.D.'s Narration	Once you embrace a relationship and decide that you're really in, everything becomes easier. And I am in, baby!
19805	Elliot	So, my parents are coming to town next week.
19806	J.D.	We must eat with them!
19807	Elliot	Oh. All right.
19808	J.D.	Hey, Elliot. Thanks for letting me crash at your place while Carla's family's in town for the wedding.
19809	Elliot	Oh, it's not problem. See ya, roomie.
19810	J.D.'s Thoughts	And now we live together.
19811	J.D.	What the?
19812	Dr. Cox	Sheila!
19813	J.D.	Aaagh!
19814	Dr. Cox	Lgh mm ogh rm um ghna kghl ghu!
19815	J.D.	I can only assume you're saying "Let me out or I'm gonna kill ya" not gonna happen.
19816	J.D.	I know! I know that makes you angry, but
19817	J.D.	Uh-oh!
19818	J.D.	Okay! Okay! You know, I'm fine the other way! However you wanna do
19819	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19820	Carla	Dr. Cox.
19821	Carla	Why is your mouth red?
19822	Dr. Cox	Duct-taped two hours in a morgue drawer; don't piss off the Janitor; end of story.
19823	Carla	...'Kay... I'm ordering more pens. Do you like twisty bottoms or clicky tops?
19824	Dr. Cox	I can't imagine anything I care less about.
19825	Dr. Kelso	Damn these twisty bottoms. We need some more clicky tops.
19826	Dr. Cox	Not gonna happen, Bob. Here I just told Carla to order a hundred thousand twisty bottoms.
19827	Dr. Kelso	Nice face. But can't you just order a box of clicky tops for me?
19828	Dr. Cox	No, Bob. Everybody gets the same.
19829	Dr. Kelso	Fine. I'll just take these.
19830	Dr. Kelso	You just bought yourself four weekends on call!
19831	Dr. Kelso	Damn twisty bottoms!
19832	Carla	You just said you didn't care. Why are you fighting?
19833	Dr. Cox	I can't stop!
19834	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19835	Turk	Baby, you mean so much to me. That's why you my baby. And, yeah, there were babies before you, but I promise you, baby, you will be my baby forever, baby.
19836	Turk	Stop saying "baby"!
19837	Marco	You're not even dressed yet!? We gotta pick up Carla on the way, man!
19838	Turk	You know what, tell her I couldn't come up with anything, so I guess I don't love her.
19839	Marco	Gimme that.
19840	Turk	For what?
19841	Marco	I'm gonna write your vows for you.
19842	Marco	Ooh! A clicky top!
19843	Turk	Does this mean we're amigos?
19844	Marco	No. It means that I love my sister, and she deserves to hear something beautiful said about her. And I'm positive if your life was on the line, you couldn't squeeze one eloquent coherent thought out of that tether ball you call a head!
19845	Turk	Thank you!
19846	Elliot	God, I can't remember the last time I saw you in this suit and tie.
19847	J.D.	How can you not remember that time we were with those
19848	Elliot	Oh, God! With the two guys!
19849	J.D.	the two guys, and their mom was trying to sing that song!
19850	Elliot	It was so funny!
19851	J.D.	So funny.
19852	J.D.	Till they had to...put their horse down.
19853	Elliot	Oh, yeah....
19854	&	Poor Cinnamon.
19855	Elliot	He could run like the wind, but his tail couldn't put out that fire.
19856	J.D.	Yeah.
19857	Elliot	God, we have so much history together. So great to finally be able to call you my boyfriend.
19858	J.D.	Boyfriend?
19859	Elliot	Oh, should I not have said that?
19860	J.D.	No it's just...it's nice to hear it out loud.
19861	J.D.'s Narration	And it was nice. I mean, here I was having my tie tied by this beautiful woman who happened to be one of my closest friends, and I realized that this is what a relationship is supposed to feel like.
19862	Elliot	There. It's perfect.
19863	J.D.	Yeah, it is.
19864	Carla	What's going on with you?
19865	Dr. Cox	Let's see, Jordan and I aren't, uh...we're not fighting anymore.
19866	Carla	Oh, no.
19867	Dr. Cox	Since the baby came along we've been fighting less and less.
19868	Carla	Why don't you get a hotel room? Pour some nice champagne, get in a tub, and rip each other new ones. You know, make it special.
19869	Dr. Cox	She won't go for that!
19870	Carla	Well, you have to do something.
19871	Dr. Cox	No I don't, you jackass!
19872	Carla	Ha ha! Sweetie, you ain't getting any here. I'm getting married tomorrow.
19873	Dr. Cox	Please?
19874	Carla	No. No. No.
19875	Carla	...And most of all, I wish our mom was with us tonight. Not because she was taken too early, but because she would see how happy you've made me, and she would love you forever for that.
19876	Carla	And Christopher
19877	Turk	Yes?
19878	Carla	I've made a lot of mistakes in my life, but you've managed to erase them all, because each and every one of them has led me to you.
19879	J.D.	Wow. That's a hard act to follow.
19880	Turk	Carla, I love that you get cold when it's seventy-one degrees out. I love that it takes you an hour and a half to order a sandwich.
19881	Turk	I love that you get a little crinkle above your nose when you're looking at me like I'm nuts. Yeah, like you got right now! Just like that one! I love that you're the last person I want to talk to before I go to sleep at night.
19882	J.D.	Turk!
19883	Turk	Dude, I'm workin' here.
19884	Carla	Turk.
19885	Turk	Yeah, baby?
19886	Carla	That's the speech from 'When Harry Met Sally'.
19887	Dr. Cox	Those pants make your ass look giant.
19888	Jordan	Stop doing this.
19889	Dr. Cox	I'm doing it for us. You suck at Scrabble.
19890	Jordan	Do I look mad?
19891	Dr. Cox	You got so much Botox in your expressionless face, I can't tell.
19892	Dr. Cox	Oh, is that a frown?
19893	Jordan	What else you got?
19894	Dr. Cox	Well, when it's my turn to listen to the baby monitor, I just wait till you're asleep and I turn it off!
19895	Jordan	Perry, give it up. There's nothing you can say!
19896	Dr. Cox	Oh.
19897	Dr. Cox	You and your mother are basically the same person.
19898	Jordan	What did you say!? I'm gonna kill you!
19899	Dr. Cox	If you don't wanna fight in front of Jack anymore, I understand that. But I don't think that means we gotta stop altogether. I mean, Jordan, you are an unpredictable, passionate person, and you challenge me each and every day. And, honestly, that's the reason I can imagine being with you when I'm seventy and you're sixty-five and your face is forty and your boobs are twenty-nine.
19900	Jordan	My face'll never look forty.
19901	Dr. Cox	You're right, my bad.
19902	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19903	Turk	Oh, my God. My future brother-in-law is an evil genius!
19904	Elliot	I'm gonna go, uh, check on "Sally"! Ha!
19905	Elliot	Okay, not funny yet.
19906	Turk	So I take it you haven't broken up with her yet.
19907	J.D.	Yeah, I decided to stay with her forever.
19908	Turk	That's great, dude. I know you think you're being nice, but I'm pretty sure Elliot doesn't want to spend her life with someone who doesn't love her.
19909	J.D.	Oh, you know what? If it's okay with you, I'm gonna go ahead and take relationship advice from someone whose fiancee is currently speaking to him. Ohhhh!
19910	Turk	Ohhhh-ho!
19911	J.D.	Gimme some champagne! I need a victory sip!
19912	Turk	Cheers.
19913	Turk	You're making a big mistake.
19914	J.D.	Come on, man. Elliot and I are like best friends. We love hanging out with each other. Maybe that's love. I mean, who who knows what love really is?
19915	Turk	I do. J.D., when I look at Carla, I see the future. I see kids, I see minivans, I see a beer gut on me, of course, not her.
19916	J.D.	I hope so.
19917	Turk	But you know what's really weird? None of that stuff scares me. Not even when
19918	J.D.	Turk.
19919	Turk	Dude, I'm trying to make a point here.
19920	J.D.	I know. Maybe you should stand up and say that.
19921	Turk	Carla.
19922	Turk	When I look into your eyes, I see the future. I see kids, I see minivans...you name it, I see it. The weird thing is, though, as long as I see your smile, none of that stuff scares me.
19923	J.D.'s Narration	Listening to Turk made me think a lot about love.
19924	J.D.'s Narration	Like how sometimes it can be hard to understand.
19925	Jordan	Why didn't you tell me you felt that way, you dumbass?
19926	Dr. Cox	Because you're so much like your mother, you wouldn'ta listened anyway.
19927	Dr. Cox	No biting.
19928	Jordan	Just take it, you girl.
19929	Dr. Cox	Mmm.
19930	J.D.'s Narration	Other times, love's obvious to everyone.
19931	Turk	...Anyway, uh...
19932	Turk	...I may not ever be able to tell you how much you mean to me, but I promise I will try to show you...for the rest of my life. I love you.
19933	Carla	I love you.
19934	Elliot	Aren't they amazing?
19935	J.D.	I don't love you.
19936	Elliot	What?
19937	J.D.	Please don't cry.
19938	Elliot	Oh, I won't.

19940	Turk	Oh-ho!

19942	Elliot	Oh, could I get a little more wine, please?
19943	Elliot	This chicken is fantastic!
19944	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19945	J.D.'s Narration	In the last three days, I convinced Elliot to dump her boyfriend and be with me, then told her I didn't love her. Still, we're good friends, so if I give her some space, eventually everything will be fine.
19946	J.D.'s Narration	Unfortunately, since Turk's whole family's in town for his wedding, I'm staying in her apartment.
19947	Elliot	We have to go.
19948	J.D.	Oogh. Agh!
19949	J.D.	My lips are bleeding! Can you hand me a tissue?
19950	J.D.	Aagghh!
19951	Turk	Hey, so what do you guys think? Extra groomsman?
19952	Marco	Sangano.
19953	Subtitle	Jackass.
19954	Turk	Don't worry, Rowdy. I'm marrying their sister.
19955	Turk	Hey! Baby! Check this out! You ain't gonna believe what I did with Rowdy!
19956	Carla	Turk! You're not allowed to see me on our wedding day, you idiot!
19957	Turk	She's mulling it over.
19958	Marco	Oh, my God. I just figured it out. This is one of those reality shows where our sister tries to convince us that she's gonna marry some obnoxious agh!
19959	Mrs. Turk	We haven't really had a chance to talk yet. I'm Mama Turk.
19960	Marco	Oh, hey. How ya doing?
19961	Mrs. Turk	Mm.
19962	Turk	Damn, that looks painful.
19963	Marco	Agh! Agh!
19964	Carla	Hey! I really want you guys to get along today!
19965	Elliot	I hope you die.
19966	Carla	Elliot!
19967	Elliot	...After the wedding.
19968	Carla	Thank you!
19969	Gabriella	Elliot. Help me wax my brow.
19970	Elliot	Okie-dokie.
19971	Carla	"I do." And then it's classy kiss....
19972	Carla	Or sexy kiss....
19973	Carla	Or slutty kiss....
19974	J.D.	That looks like fun. Can I help?
19975	Elliot	Uh, help this.
19976	J.D.	Elliot, maybe you should pay attention to what you're doing.
19977	Elliot	Oh, really?
19978	Elliot	Uhmm.... How how thin did you want those?
19979	J.D.	Turk and I have to go.
19980	J.D.'s Narration	See, Turk and I had made a pact.
19981	J.D.'s Narration	The day that one of us got married, we'd play a last round of tennis-ball golf in the parking lot as single best friends.
19982	J.D.	Look out, Tiger!
19983	Turk	That'll play.
19984	J.D.	Hell yeah.
19985	J.D.'s Narration	Oh, yeah, and the guy getting married has to caddie for the other guy naked.
19986	Guy	Huh?
19987	&	Ohhh....
19988	J.D.	He'll be fine.
19989	J.D.	I can't believe you're actually gettin' married.
19990	Turk	Me neither, buddy.
19991	J.D.	Hey, where's the fuzzy cover for my one-wood?
19992	Turk	It's on my nine-wood.
19993	J.D.	Aw, dude! My mom made that!
19994	J.D.	Still, I'm happy for you, man.
19995	Turk	Yeah, me too.
19996	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
19997	Elliot	Oh, great. I think I'm getting a pimple.
19998	Elliot	Is this noticeable?
19999	Elliot	I'll ask someone else.
20000	J.D.	Hide the bride! I found him!
20001	Carla	Turk, we're heading over to St. John's.
20002	J.D.	Thought you guys were getting married at Holy Trinity?
20003	Carla	St. John's is cheaper.
20004	Turk	Oh, plus the priest there looks like Captain Sulu.
20005	Carla	No, that's the priest at Trinity.
20006	Turk	Oh, baby, I wanted to be married by Sulu!
20007	Carla	Turk, are you coming over with us now or not?
20008	Turk	If I work this shift, I can finagle two extra days on the honeymoon.
20009	J.D.	Ooh, nice use of "finagle."
20010	Turk	Oh, thanks.
20011	J.D.	Mmm.
20012	Turk	Look, I get outta here at 4, ceremony doesn't start until 5. Worst case scenario, I'm a _little_ late for the wedding.
20013	Carla	Do it!
20014	Turk	Oh! Whoa!
20015	J.D.	Dude, you're dealing with a nervous bride, a woman I scorned, and two sisters with three eyebrows.
20016	Turk	See you at 5!
20017	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
20018	Carla	Hey, Elliot, how are you doing with this whole J.D. thing?
20019	Elliot	I can't believe that on this day you would actually worry about how I'm doing. Carla, you're such an amazing friend.
20020	Carla	Don't do this, Elliot. I promised myself I wouldn't get emotional until after we took the pictures.
20021	Elliot	I just love you so much.
20022	Carla	I love you too!
20023	Elliot	Even though I ripped off your sister's eyebrow?
20024	Carla	That's okay.... You know, this morning she actually said she was gonna look better than me!?
20025	Elliot	Not anymore!
20026	Elliot	Car-Carla, there is a man filming us.
20027	Carla	Oh, he's just doing our wedding video. Hi, Anthony.
20028	Anthony	What's up, babe.
20029	Elliot	Oh, my God! You're actually getting married in a few hours! I mean, everything's gonna be all different. Carla, you never have to have sex again except for when you actually want to.
20030	Carla	I know!!!
20031	Carla	Erase that last part.
20032	Dr. Miller	So, are you ready for your appendectomy?
20033	Mr. Fitzpatrick	Hey, what do you do with an appendix after you've removed it?
20034	Turk	We make finger puppets.
20035	Dr. Miller	Ha! Don't mind Dr. Turk, here. He's just overly excited because he's getting married this afternoon. I, on the other hand, am the only person in the hospital not to be invited.
20036	Turk	Dr. Miller, look, it's a really small wedding, and you're an amazing boss, and I feel really bad about it, so...there's a wedding brunch tomorrow, and it's only for family and really close friends, and...well, we'd love for you to be there.
20037	Dr. Miller	That would mean the world to me!
20038	Turk	Okay, I didn't think you were gonna say yes. There's no brunch.
20039	Turk	That's gonna cost me.
20040	Dr. Cox	Jordan, get outta bed. We got a wedding to go to.
20041	Jordan	Perry.... Jack is at my mom's, the apartment is empty.... It's just you and me.... Let's take a nap! We'll sleep through the ceremony, and then go to the reception.
20042	Dr. Cox	Can we at least have sex?

20051	J.D.	Danni, what are you doing here?
20052	Danni	We RSVP'd when we were still dating.
20053	J.D.	You can't just crash my best friend's wedding!

20070	Dr. Miller	Wait. Look at his lesions on his peritoneum.
20071	Turk	Oh, no.
20072	Dr. Miller	Dr. Turk...what do you think we should do?

Tonight, you and I, we're gonna rip it up. And then we're gonna hop on a plane to the Bahamas, where you and I can get married tomorrow amongst the fishes and mermaids and whatnot.
20181	Carla	Turk, for the last time, mermaids aren't real!
20182	Turk	I know what I saw!

20207	Sean	So, what have you been up to?
20208	Elliot	Doctor stuff. Heh. You?
20209	Sean	Oh, I I was crying a lot. And then I got really emotionally numb. Um, oh, and this morning, I jammed a salad fork two inches into my thigh to see if I could still feel the pain.
20210	Elliot	And?
20211	Sean	Oh, yeah.
20212	Elliot	Good.
20213	Sean	Elliot, do you wanna get out of here?
20214	Elliot	Sean, look, I don't know what J.D. told you, but...if we're gonna give this another try, you need to know that I didn't end things with you because I was freaking out about us living together. I did it because...J.D. and I have this history and...I actually thought he might be the one. But I just ended up getting my heart broken.
20215	Sean	Sucks, doesn't it?
20216	Elliot	Yeah.
20217	Dr. Cox	Carla?
20218	Dr. Cox	I apologize. I am a horse's ass.
20219	Carla	It's not you. It's everything!
20220	Dr. Cox	Come on, marriage is overrated. Jordan and I aren't married, and we're getting along great.
20221	Jordan	Uh, Perr, is making out with a stranger cheating?
20222	Dr. Cox	Technically not if it's under ten seconds, dear.
20223	Jordan	Ah, not worth it.
20224	Dr. Cox	Look, you and Turk were meant to be together. It's fate and you know it.
20225	Carla	Thank you.

20230	Turk	Okay, Carla's dying, it's rally time. We have no band, we have no DJ. You're my best man brainstorm.
20231	J.D.	Remember that after-party we had in college, when the stereo went out and I ended up hooking up with that grad student from Brazil?
20232	Turk	Yeah?
20233	J.D.	That was awesome.
20234	Turk	Woo hoo, you made out with a little person.
20235	J.D.	I thought she was kneeling.
20236	J.D.	Ted! Can you play a little music for us, buddy?
20237	Ted	It's gonna cost you double what you paid us for the church.
20238	Turk	Here's twenty.
20239	Ted	Aaaand, here's four back.
20240	J.D.	Kick it.
20241	Ted	All riiiight!
20242	Sean	So, uh...so call me if you ever wanna get drunk and have sex.
20243	Elliot	Bye, Sean.
20244	Sean	Bye.
20245	Danni	Can I have a ride home?
20246	Sean	Uh, well...sure.
20247	Sean	Oh! Okay!
20248	J.D.	You can't let him drive her home! She says "thank you" the naughty way!
20249	Elliot	J.D.! It's not happening. Besides, if Sean and I are meant to be together, I never would have gone home with you that night and sabotaged everything that I had with him.
20250	J.D.	You and I are gonna be okay, right?
20251	Elliot	What do you think?
20252	J.D.	Probably not.
20253	J.D.	Elliot!
20254	J.D.	You let me know when we are.
20255	Elliot	Don't hold your breath.
20256	Dr. Kelso	Ahhh! Dr. Turkleton!
20257	Turk	Actually, sir, it's Turk.
20258	Dr. Kelso	That's your first name.
20259	Turk	You think my name is Turk Turkleton?
20260	Dr. Kelso	And Mrs. Turkleton! The Turkletons! Can I get a scotch?
20261	Carla	Hey, baby.
20262	Turk	I'm so sorry I messed everything up, baby.
20263	Carla	Don't be. Let's dance.
20264	Turk	Set me up, Ted.
20265	Ted	Um, hi. We haven't used instruments in a long time, so bear with us if we're a little rusty.... One, two, three.
20266	J.D.'s Narration	I guess, in the end, things seldom work out exactly the way you expect.
20267	Carla	Turk, our plane leaves in an hour.
20268	Turk	I know, I just gotta check on my patient, baby.
20269	Turk	Hey. How's it going, Mr. Fitzpatrick?
20270	Mr. Fitzpatrick	Actually, it's Father Fitzpatrick.
20271	Carla	Could you do us a quick favor?
20272	Turk	Mm-hmm.
20273	J.D.'s Narration	Other times, well, you've kind of sealed your own fate.
20274	J.D.'s Narration	Either way, you have to trust that whatever's supposed to happen, will happen.
20275	J.D.'s Narration	Besides, somehow you always seem to end up with the person you're meant to be with.
20276	Janitor	One, two, three.
20277	J.D.	Thanks for helping out.
20278	Janitor	I'm only going as far as the dumpster.
20279	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
20280	Guy	Ahh. Ahhhh.
20281	J.D.	My shift hasn't started yet. Try that guy.
20282	Guy	Who, that guy right there?
20283	J.D.	Yeah.
20284	Guy	All right, thank you.
20285	Guy	Aaaahhhh.
20286	J.D.'s Narration	A lot's been going on around here the last two weeks. Turk and Carla got married, that short guy hurt his hand....
20287	J.D.'s Narration	And since I totally broke Elliot's heart, I was still trying to smooth things over.
20288	J.D.	Hey, buddy. What's with the giant needle?
20289	J.D.'s Narration	We still had some work to do.
20290	J.D.'s Narration	Where was I? Oh, yeah. The hospital also had a new attending psychologist.
20291	J.D.'s Narration	Dr...Molly...Clock.
20292	Molly	This is a really windy hospital.
20293	Janitor	Oh, I'm sorry. I was, uh, drying up a patient's urine.
20294	Molly	Hmm.
20295	Janitor	I'm I'm kind of a favorite around here!
20296	J.D.'s Narration	Not only was Dr. Clock easy on the eyes, but apparently she was an excellent shrink.
20297	Molly	Mr. Witcomb is in the middle of a psychotic break from self-discontinuation of his meds, so we need to get him on Haloperidol IV stat.
20298	J.D.'s Narration	But I also heard she was a little spacy.
20299	Molly	So where were we?
20300	J.D.	Um...we weren't talking.
20301	Molly	Was it 'cause of something you did, 'cause I am totally over it. I don't even remember what it was.
20302	J.D.	No, I mean like we've never talked...ever.
20303	Molly	Well how do I know your name, then?
20304	J.D.	You don't.
20305	Molly	You're freakin' me out, Jimmy!
20306	J.D.	It's Johnny.
20307	J.D.'s Thoughts	Why would you say "Johnny"? You hate "Johnny"!
20308	Molly	Now I'm gonna commit it to my memory forever.
20309	Molly	Johnny.... Johnny.... Johnny....
20310	J.D.'s Thoughts	Dammit! Dammit! Dammit!
20311	Molly	Okay, Johnny
20312	J.D.'s Thoughts	Dammit!
20313	Molly	I'm sorry, I'm just meeting so many people, and everyone's kind of cliquish and I haven't really gotten to know anybody.
20314	J.D.	So let's talk! It's not like I'm going anywhere, right?
20315	Molly	Great! Oh, thanks. Okay
20316	There's a honking outside	Beep beep-beep beep beep....
20317	J.D.	'Scuse me.
20318	J.D.	Turk's back from his honeymoon!
20319	Molly	Nice to meet you...!

20321	J.D.	TURK! HEY!
20322	Carla	Go ahead.
20323	Turk	JAAAAAAAY DEEEEEEEE!
20324	Turk	Whooooa, J.D.! J.D.!
20325	Carla	Maybe some day he'll love me like that.
20326	J.D.	He's here! TURK!
20327	Turk	JAAAAAAAY DEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
20328	J.D.	TUUUUUUUUUUUURK!
20329	J.D.	TURK?!
20330	Turk	J.D.!
20331	Turk	J.D.?!
20332	J.D.	TURK!
20333	Turk	DUDE!
20334	J.D.	Stay right there! I'm so excited!
20335	J.D.	AWWWW, HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?
20336	Turk	The roof!
20337	J.D.	I'LL HOLLA!
20338	Turk	ALL RIGHT, LOOK, FROM NOW ON, WE'RE CALLING THIS "ROOF A".
20339	J.D.	GOT IT!
20340	J.D.	TURK!
20341	J.D.	Eeeeheee!
20342	Dr. Cox	Well, well, well.... What do we have here? The newlyweds! Oh, and, hey Carla.
20343	Dr. Cox	Mark my words, the first year of marriage is just a real treat! Sweetheart, do you remember ours?
20344	Jordan	The silly fighting for control!
20345	Dr. Cox	You broke my jaw!
20346	Jordan	You gotta stop that back-talk early.Come on, glass jaw.
20347	Dr. Cox	Duck and move, Gandhi. Here it is, here it is, watch it ohhhh, duck and move.
20348	Carla	Ignore him, baby. We have a great relationship. Nothing's gonna change.
20349	J.D.'s Narration	Over the next few days, Carla started to change everything.
20350	Turk	Hey, dude, get us some more ice cream.
20351	J.D.	First of all, this is a Rice Dream mm, ricey secondly, I can't get out of these new chairs she got. Am I using it right?
20352	Turk	These bowls Carla bought don't hold a lot of Rice Dream. I can barely get my spoon in it. Look.
20353	Carla	Hey, J.D.? Although we do appreciate the wedding gift?
20354	J.D.	Mm-hmm.
20355	Carla	Turk and I decided we don't want this Sugar Hill Gang alarm clock.
20356	Turk	We don't?
20357	J.D.	I got it.
20358	J.D.	Whoa. I got it. I'm okay. I don't oh, here it goes. Whoa! Aaaagh!
20359	J.D.	I'm still in the chair! I it it's like a bear-trap!
20360	J.D.'s Narration	As I fondled Katya, my pillow girlfriend, I thought about how things had changed for all of us. You see, I had almost forgotten that when I wake up, it'll be the start of my last week as a resident.
20361	The Sugar Hill Gang alarm clock on the bedside table clicks over to 6	0. The opening beat of their "Rapper's Delight" comes on.
20362	Sugar Hill Gang	"I said a hip, hop, the hippy, the hippy to the hip-hip-hop you don't stop the rockin' to the bang bang boogie, said up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogity beat! Now what you hear is not a dream, so listen up, you nappy head! Yo, hear my rhyme, it's wake-up time, so get your white ass outta bed! You see I am what "
20363	J.D.	Snooze!

20365	J.D.	Don't look at me, it just fell.
20366	J.D.'s Thoughts	Please please please please please please please please please please please please please!
20367	Janitor	Proceed unmolested.
20368	J.D.'s Narration	I knew he'd buy it, because today feels like one of those great days in the hospital. People really seem to be getting to know each other.
20369	Molly	Bob, Bob, Bob.... Bob.... Bob.....
20370	Dr. Kelso	Fantastic. Get off my face.
20371	J.D.'s Narration	My last week of residency had begun. In seven days I'd be a full-fledged doctor. It felt pretty special to me, and I had a hunch it meant a lot to one other person as well.
20372	Dr. Cox	Yes, milady?
20373	J.D.	Sooo, ya felling all, like, blalala!
20374	Dr. Cox	That depends, does "blalalala" mean confused and incredibly annoyed?
20375	J.D.	Come on, man, it's our last week together! The J.D. and Cox train is pulling into the station. You must have a metaphor you want to use; hit me with it!
20376	Dr. Cox	I suppose I could riff a list of things that I care as little about as our last week together. Lemme see, uhh.... Low-carb diets. Michael Moore. The Republican National Convention. Kabbalah and all Kabbalah-related products. Hi-def TV, the Bush daughters, wireless hot spots, 'The O.C.', the U.N., recycling, getting Punk'd, Danny Gans, the Latin Grammys, the real Grammys. Jeff, that Wiggle who sleeps too darn much! The Yankees payroll, all the red states, all the blue states, every hybrid car, every talk show host! Everything on the planet, everything in the solar system, everything everything everything everything everything everything eve everything that exists past, present and future, in all discovered and undiscovered dimensions.
20377	Dr. Cox	Oh! And Hugh Jackman. Eh.
20378	J.D.	Hugh Jackman's Wolverine! How dare he.

20380	Elliot	I missed you guys so much.
20381	Carla	Mmm.... Oh, come over tonight! We're looking at wedding pictures.
20382	Elliot	Ooh! There's this one picture of me right after I got sick off my...third champagne and Red Bull, and my hair is kind of like sexy-messy, and the photographer said he could airbrush all of the puke off my dress.
20383	Carla	Already made doubles.
20384	Elliot	You rock! Heh.Ssso, um...is J.D. gonna be there tonight?
20385	Carla	Can't you come over anyway?
20386	Elliot	Um....
20387	Molly	Hey! Do you guys mind if I eat with you? 'Cause I don't wanna sit alone and sing to my food like a crazy person.
20388	Elliot	Oh, my gosh! I do that!
20389	Molly	No way!
20390	Elliot	Mostly pop songs. You know, unless I'm eating soul food.
20391	Carla	Where's your food?
20392	Molly	Oh, shoot.
20393	Carla	Look, Elliot, we'll do something later this week, just the two of us.
20394	Elliot	Okay.
20395	Molly	Ahh. Oh, that is not my food. But I'm not getting up again.
20396	Elliot	Oh, I wouldn't.
20397	Molly	Chicken salaaaad! Oh, yeeah. Looks good.
20398	Carla	I gotta go. See ya.
20399	Elliot	It's so strange feeling all alone when like a month ago I was part of this really tight group, you know?
20400	Molly	Yeah. I had tons of friends at my old hospital.
20401	Elliot	I gotta meet some new people.
20402	Molly	Do you wanna, uh, get a cup of coffee tonight?
20403	Elliot	Can't. I'm hitting the internet hard and going on a friend hunt!
20404	Molly	Oh, chicken salaaad! You're tasty, you're food to be eaten, it's good!

20406	J.D.	When you get back from surgery, Mrs. Grodberg, we'll play Scrabble again! And this time I'll beat you!
20407	Dr. Kelso	Well, of course you'll beat her, son, she's having half her brain removed! Heh-heh!
20408	Turk	J.D. A little problem this morning with Malik.
20409	J.D.	Our car? Is it bad?
20410	Turk	Hey, Triple A? Look, I need a pick-up on the corner of Fourth and
20411	Turk	You know what? You'll see it.
20412	J.D.	Ah, Malik. Lots of memories in that old car.
20413	Carla	Of what?
20414	J.D.	Driving, mostly.
20415	Turk	Beep, beep.
20416	Carla	Look, why don't we pool our money together and buy one of those nice cute little Mini Coopers?
20417	Turk	Baby, a Mini Cooper?
20418	J.D.'s Narration	And then the most amazing thing happened.
20419	Carla	I'll tell you what, Turk. Why don't you go pick out our car.
20420	J.D.'s Narration	Carla let Turk make a decision!
20421	Turk	Okay! But, baby, you should know that it's not gonna be a Mini. 'Cause ain't nothing really mini about me!
20422	J.D.	There isn't.
20423	Turk	There isn't! Heh!
20424	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
20425	J.D.	Mr. Radford, if you keep turning down physical therapy, you're never gonna be strong enough to get out of this bed.
20426	Mr. Radford	I'm tired.
20427	J.D.	I know you are, but I would love it if you'd at least try.
20428	Mr. Blass	"And I would do anything for love, but I won't do that. No, I won't do that."
20429	J.D.	Haunting.
20430	Molly	Drink your juice, Mr. Blass.
20431	Molly	Mr. Blass has Pick's disease, which is similar to presentation to multi-infarct dementia.
20432	J.D.	Mmm.
20433	Molly	Anyhoo, he likes to sing when he gets up in the morning, and the weird thing is, Johnny, he actually captures the mood of the room.
20434	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, you gotta take a stand on this "Johnny" thing before it becomes permanent.
20435	J.D.	You know what, it's "J.D." for "John Dorian," so so John...look, you know what, Johnny's fine, it's cool.
20436	J.D.'s Thoughts	What's wrong with you?
20437	Molly	Anyway, Johnny, I was noticing that you were having some trouble motivating your patient back in there, and I actually published a paper on motivation methodology in post-operative seniors, so, if you want, I could help.
20438	J.D.	What floor?
20439	Molly	Oh, my god, we're on an elevator.
20440	J.D.	You know, Molly, I appreciate the offer, but there's a very special doctor I use around here when I need help, and he'd be pretty pissed if I didn't come to him first.
20441	Dr. Cox	Why, Mariska? Why do you insist on bothering _me_ with these things?
20442	J.D.	Please, you know you love it. Now, come on, one more time for nostalgia's sake: You come see my patient, you teach me a lesson, and then the music plays, right? In my head, it sounds like this: Ba-buh-buh-ba-buh-buh-buh, ba-buh-buh-ba-buh-buh-buh-buhhh.
20443	Carla	Dr. Cox, can I borrow you for a minute?
20444	Dr. Cox	Borrow me? Dearheart, you'd be rescuing me.Newbie, you're on your own. Get used to it.
20445	J.D.	...Buh-ba-buh-buh-buh-buh-buhh....
20446	Carla	I'munna prove to you why my first year of marriage isn't gonna be as hard as yours was.
20447	Dr. Cox	I think you're setting the bar a little low on that one, there, sweetcheeks.
20448	Carla	Yeah, still, the point is I'm smarter than you.
20449	Dr. Cox	In relationships?
20450	Carla	In everything.
20451	Dr. Cox	Right!
20452	Carla	See, even though I make all the decisions, whenever I see Turk is getting upset, I throw him a little decision that means nothing to me. Like buying a new car as long as it's got four wheels and air conditioning, I'm hap
20453	Carla	py.
20454	Turk	Check it, baby! Scooters!
20455	Carla	Hehhh.
20456	Dr. Cox	Fantastic!
20457	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
20458	J.D.	He's a drinker!
20459	Elliot	Mm-hm. Clever. Look, J.D., I think this is so unfair. I mean, I never get to see Turk and Carla anymore.
20460	Elliot	It's like we got divorced and you get to keep the friends just because you live with them.
20461	Elliot	It just feels like you guys are part of some sort of gang or something.
20462	J.D.	Elliot, you're overreacting. We're not some kind of gang, okay?
20463	Elliot	Okay.
20464	J.D.	Wolverines, let's roll!
20465	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
20466	J.D.'s Narration	That joyride around the hospital made me realize two things. First, it's a bad idea to take a full bladder out on your hog. Also, I had to draw upon all my medical experience to get Mr. Radford out of bed.
20467	J.D.	Mr. Radford, they're showing 'Cocoon' in the chapel!
20468	Mr. Radford	I'm not a big Guttenberg fan.
20469	J.D.	Well, you're the only one, 'cause people in the hall are going crazy!
20470	Molly	Akbar. Akbar. Akbar. Oh, Johnny! Hey!
20471	Akbar	Run away with me.
20472	Molly	I was just looking at Mr. Radford's chart.
20473	J.D.	Ahh, I know you're new here, but that's my patient's chart, and no one touches my patient's chart
20474	J.D.	except for him.
20475	J.D.'s Thoughts	Yes! I knew he couldn't stay away.
20476	Molly	Hi, I'm Molly. And I kinda tagged in here with the Mr. Radford thing, 'cause I
20477	Dr. Cox	Molly, Molly, Molly, you lost me at "hello."
20478	Molly	Wow, no touchy.
20479	Dr. Cox	Fair enough.Uhh, Mr. Radford, do I understand you have pain issues but you don't want physical therapy?
20480	Mr. Radford	I just don't have it in me.
20481	J.D.	Here comes the magic. He always gives me goosebumps.
20482	Dr. Cox	Okay, then. I sure hope you're comfortable in that bed, because you're gonna be in one just like it for the rest of your natural born life.
20483	J.D.	What the hell was that?
20484	Dr. Cox	That... was me talking to a patient who has thrown in the towel. You can't save everyone, Newbie, so I suggest you start working with people who want your help. That's what I will be doing.
20485	Molly	Goosebumps?
20486	J.D.	They're small. And...you you can't see them.

20491	J.D.'s Thoughts	Half a brain, dammit!
20492	Dr. Cox	Goodnight, Giselle.
20493	J.D.	Dr. Cox.
20494	J.D.	I just want you to know I'm not ready to give up on Mr. Radford.
20495	Dr. Cox	Do you want me to give you my "things I don't care about" speech again? Because, you know, I've updated it to include all white guys who add -izzle to anything.
20496	J.D.	I agrizzle, my nizzle.
20497	Dr. Cox	Go on home and get in bed, will ya. I'm betting your friend Mr. Radford's already in his.I'll see ya.
20498	Dr. Kelso	Well, sweetheart, you're here early.
20499	Elliot	Yeah, well, you know I didn't have any plans last night, so I went to bed at 8 and then I woke up at 4. And then I realized that the sunrise just looks beautiful through the trees, and that my neighbor gets his paper in the _nude_...and that he needs to lose like 900 pounds.
20500	Dr. Kelso	In the future, the appropriate response is, "Yes, I am here early" it's called 'small talk', not 'my depressing life in thirty seconds'.
20501	Elliot	I am not, heh, depressed, sir. In fact, nothing is gonna get me down today!
20502	Mr. Blass	"All by myself. Don't wanna be all by my "
20503	Elliot	Oh, shut up!
20504	Molly	Did you just tell my patient to shut up? 'Cause that seems not very doctory.
20505	Elliot	No. I mean, I said it like all those high school girls do in the mall, like, "Oh, shut _up_!"I should go.
20506	Molly	Kick it, Mr. Blass.

20513	J.D.	Why the giant X?
20514	Janitor	Why the stupid face?
20515	J.D.	Touché.
20516	Janitor	You know, I know you knocked that exit sign down.
20517	J.D.	Well then I'm sure I can expect an appropriate retaliatory response. Maybe you could shoot me in the neck.
20518	Janitor	Sounds like fun, but no. Our game is over, buddy. Your residency's coming to a close and...that's it, nothing left to do but:
20519	J.D.	What can I say, it's been...horrifying.
20520	Janitor	Thank you!
20521	J.D.	Well, this is kinda cool! Hey, you know, maybe we could, like, be friends.
20522	Janitor	You like huntin' squirrels?
20523	J.D.	I'd never tried it.
20524	Janitor	Easiest thing in the world all you need are some walnuts...and a boxing glove!
20525	J.D.'s Narration	And the day just got better from there.
20526	J.D.'s Narration	Mostly because Mr. Radford had the same "screw you, Dr. Cox" attitude that I had.
20527	J.D.	Good stuff, Mr. Radford! I'm proud of you!
20528	Mr. Radford	I hate you!
20529	Elderly Lady	Excuse me, doctor. I dropped a nickel in that therapy whirlpool. You think you could get it for me?
20530	J.D.	Okay, but stand back. These things can be pretty dangerous!
20531	J.D.	Whoa. Oh, boy. Whooooaaaa! Agghhh!
20532	J.D.	Aaaaggglghlgggh! Aggghhh!
20533	Elliot	So, what, are they shooting some sort of Geeks of Sacred Heart calendar out here?
20534	J.D.	Actually, no, I almost drowned diving for a nickel; but I'm sure you're more interested in conspiracy theories about gangs and friend stealing. Peace out.

20539	Elliot	I'm sorry. Look, um.... You wouldn't understand.
20540	Molly	No, I get it. I mean, you're feeling lonely, you're feeling rejected. I mean, most people around here won't talk to me, and even Johnny won't take my help.
20541	Elliot	Who's Johnny?
20542	Molly	You know, he's a resident, he's got like gelled-up hair, and he and his friends are in a motorcycle gang?
20543	Elliot	I knew it!!!
20544	Molly	You know what, Elliot, you act like everyone's boxing you out, but you wouldn't even get a cup of coffee with me.
20545	Molly	Peace out, baby.
20546	Elliot	Why is everybody saying that?
20547	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
20548	Turk	Great news, baby. I just picked your grandparents up from the airport!
20549	Turk	Hang on, Nana! Hang on, Grampa!
20550	Turk	Not only did I get them home, I lost six pounds! Ha ha!
20551	Carla	Gimme those stupid keys!
20552	Turk	Mm-mm.
20553	Turk	OH!
20554	Carla	That's what I think of your scooters! No more bugs in my teeth! No more helmet head! No more making deals with God every time a truck passes me on the freeway, okay? It's over! That's it!
20555	Turk	What the hell just happened?
20556	Dr. Kelso	You got married, Turkleton.
20557	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
20558	J.D.	That, my friends, is Mr. Radford getting out of bed.
20559	J.D.	And that's Mr. Radford falling back into bed. But still, enough to rub it in Dr. Cox's face.
20560	Molly	That is so great! But I wouldn't do that unless you want him to rub your face in it.
20561	J.D.	Did you not see what just happened, or do you not get face rubbing? Because it's more than just a bizarro way to memorize people's names.
20562	Molly	Johnny, I mean what Dr. Cox did was classic reverse psychology. And so is this: Behavioral modification can sometimes be brought about through classic conditioning.
20563	Molly	Reverse psychology? Nothing? 'Cause that really kills at the psychiatric conferences.
20564	J.D.	I must go to one of those.
20565	Molly	Look, isn't it possible that Dr. Cox tricked you as a motivational ploy?
20566	J.D.	Hmm, no.
20567	Molly	After he said there was no hope with Mr. Radford, didn't you both work harder?
20568	J.D.	Nnoo! You're like a crazy person!
20569	Molly	Look, I'll tell you something else. I mean, Dr. Cox is a text-book closed-off alpha male. I mean, you can try forever, but you're never gonna get that hug that you really want.
20570	J.D.	Uh, excuse me, I'm not a child. I'm a doctor.
20571	J.D.'s Thoughts	And I'll get that hug!
20572	Elliot	Hey! Watch it!
20573	Molly	Oh! Hot! Ah! Ahh!
20574	Elliot	I, um...brought you coffee.
20575	Molly	Oh, it's burning, it's like fire! Ah!
20576	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
20577	Carla	Baby, I know you don't wanna return the scooters.
20578	Turk	Can't this wait till after my scooter club's fall foliage trip through Maine?
20579	Carla	No, Turk!
20580	Turk	Maaaan!
20581	Carla	Look! You're a husband now. When you make decisions, you're supposed to think about what _we_ need, not what _you_ want!
20582	Turk	Well, it doesn't seem like you're doing that! You gave away my clock! And you sold my chairs. And what the hell is up with these ridiculously tiny bowls!?
20583	Carla	They're sake cups, Jethro!
20584	Turk	I knew that....
20585	Carla	Everything I do, Turk, I do it for us!
20586	Turk	Oh, yeah? Then why does Rowdy smell like daisies?
20587	Carla	'Cause I had him filled with potpourri.
20588	Carla	You can keep the scooters.
20589	Turk	That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
20590	Carla	Marriage is gonna be tricky.
20591	Turk	Yeah.
20592	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
20593	Molly	Thanks.
20594	Elliot	How are your thighs?
20595	Molly	They're very hot and pink.
20596	Elliot	Do you want me to rub ointment on them?
20597	Molly	It's okay.
20598	Guys	Awwwwwwww.
20599	Molly	Weird.
20600	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
20601	J.D.	Ka-pow!
20602	Dr. Cox	Look at that. I knew I smelled that odd combination of fear and baby powder.
20603	J.D.'s Thoughts	How does he know about my belly rash?
20604	J.D.	Look, Dr. Cox, I know you were using reverse psychology with Mr. Radford.
20605	Dr. Cox	You do, do you?
20606	J.D.	Yes. And I figured it out all by myself, without anyone helping me or explaining it directly in my face or anything.
20607	Dr. Cox	Well, nubile one, your last lesson and you didn't even need it.
20608	Dr. Cox	Three years and it's finally over. I know what you want, I do.
20609	Dr. Cox	Come here.
20610	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, my God, it's finally happening! Don't miss a moment! Take it all in! Ba-buh-ba-buh-buh-buhh, buh-ba-ba-ba-ba-buh-buhhh
20611	J.D.	Ow.
20612	Dr. Cox	Good God, Fantasia. You you don't actually think I'm done teaching you, do you? D'you not understand the only difference between today and tomorrow is that you wake up tomorrow and start coming in here and killing people, that no one can say, "It's no big deal, he's just a resident." Instead, what they're damn sure gonna be wondering is who tried to educate your sorry ass. And when that finger of blame starts pointing in my direction, I had damn sure better be in a coma from the anger stroke I suffered from the last time you tried to hug me.
20613	Dr. Cox	Oh, and, uh, don't be late tomorrow...Doctor.
20614	J.D.'s Narration	Whether or not you survive in a hospital is all about how you handle your relationships.
20615	Molly&	"All by myself / Don't wanna be..."Elliot
20616	J.D.'s Narration	Whether it's a brand new one...
20617	Molly&	"...all by myself!"Elliot
20618	J.D.'s Narration	...or an old one you need to figure out all over again.
20619	Carla	Oh, my God!!!!
20620	Turk	Huh?
20621	Carla	I can't believe you did this!
20622	Turk	Yeah.
20623	Carla	It's even minier than I imagined!But what about you?
20624	Turk	Ah, baby, don't worry about it, I got it covered. Check it out.
20625	Carla	Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
20626	J.D.'s Narration	As for me, it was my relationships that got me through my residency.
20627	J.D.'s Thoughts	Ba-buh-buh-buh-ba-buh-buh-buhhh. Buh-buh-buh-buh-ba
20628	J.D.	Hooogh! Aaaaaaaaaaauuuugggghhh!
20629	J.D.	Oof.
20630	Janitor	Bull's eye!
20631	J.D.	We're not done with our thing yet, are we.
20632	Janitor	No. For you, it's all just beginning.
20633	J.D.'s Narration	The weird thing is, he was right.
20634	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
20635	J.D.'s Narration	I was a little nervous today. Maybe it was because I had no idea who this guy on the back of my bike was.
20636	Guy	See ya tomorrow!
20637	J.D.	Will do.
20638	J.D.'s Narration	Or maybe I was nervous because at 3 o'clock, Dr. Cox was gonna name me the new chief resident. How do I know? Well, for one thing, I'm the only one who applied. But I'm also the only one who's truly focused enough to
20639	J.D.	Oh, God.
20640	Movers	Hey!
20641	Turk	So lemme get this straight: You crashed in to their truck, and they just drive you to work?
20642	J.D.	Well, we didn't come straight here.
20643	FLASHBACK	STREET
20644	J.D.	Come on, Dorian. You gotta want it!
20645	Turk	Hold up. They made you move furniture?
20646	J.D.	It wasn't all bad.
20647	FLASHBACK	STREET
20648	J.D.	Bubble wrap! Bubble wrap! Bubble wrap!
20649	Movers	Yeah! Bubble wrap!
20650	J.D.'s Narration	Dr. Molly Clock, the new attending psychiatrist. Yes, she was HOHHHT! But I wasn't a fan. For one thing, she's always calling me "Johnny." Also, she wasn't very nice.
20651	Molly	Hey, sit with us. We'll make room, even if I have to stand.
20652	J.D.'s Narration	What. A. Bitch. Plus, she's _always_ with Elliot; and since I dumped her, we weren't getting along all that great.
20653	J.D.	Anybody got any extra ketchup packets?
20654	J.D.	Thank you, Elliot.
20655	Elliot	Mm.
20656	Carla	So, what are you guys gonna do now that your residencies are over?
20657	Doug	Oh, I'm still a resident! Yeah, Dr. Kelso said I'm the first medical resident to repeat his third year in the entire history of the hospital!
20658	Carla	That's a bad thing, Doug,
20659	Doug	Oh, I'm staying positive.
20660	Elliot	Well, I'm starting my endocrinology and metabolism fellowship. I'm really looking forward to cataloguing all of the genetic variations of
20661	Elliot	Oh, really? Well, excuse me for taking an interest in hormonal regulatory research and relate
20662	Carla	You know, Elliot, I still think you'd make a good chief resident.
20663	Elliot	Carla, for the five billionth time, I'm not interested.
20664	Molly	I think you would be a great chief resident!
20665	Elliot	You do?
20666	Carla	I just said that.
20667	Turk	I know!
20668	J.D.	Sorry, ladies, job's taken.
20669	Elliot	Dr. Cox is naming ass-face, here, at 3. It's too late.
20670	Carla	Well maybe it's not too late.
20671	Elliot	Yeah it is, Carla.
20672	Molly	Maybe it's not.
20673	Elliot	You know what, you're right, Molly. Maybe it isn't!
20674	Carla	What the hell?
20675	Turk?	They're all against you!
20676	Dr. Cox	I'm invisible, I'm invisible, I'm invisible, I'm invisible, I'm invisible, I'm
20677	Elliot	Dr. Cox!
20678	Dr. Cox	ah, dammit!
20679	Elliot	Can I still be considered as a candidate for the chief residency?
20680	J.D.	She asked, without a prayer.
20681	Dr. Cox	Sure, why not.
20682	Elliot	Raise it! Raise it! Uh-oh, uh-oh! And grind. Grind it, grind it!
20683	Turk	You okay, buddy?
20684	J.D.'s Narration	I just needed to talk to someone.
20685	Mover	Tough break, J.D. You've dreamed of being chief resident ever since you were a little boy growing up in Trotwood, Ohio.
20686	J.D.'s Thoughts	What? How does he know that?
20687	J.D.	Thank you, Frank.
20688	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
20689	Dr. Kelso	So whatta you think, Perry?
20690	Dr. Cox	I don't know what to tell you, there, Bobbo. Either this kid has a lightbulb up his butt or his colon has a great idea.
20691	Dr. Kelso	Excuse us, Lyle.
20692	Dr. Cox	Come on, Newbie.
20693	Lyle	Hey, do you have a magazine?
20694	J.D.	Not in me I mean, on me.
20695	Dr. Kelso	That young man's father is very important.
20696	Dr. Cox	Don't tell me. He donated a wing.
20697	Dr. Kelso	He donated a wing, a thigh, and a breast.
20698	J.D.	Sir?
20699	Dr. Kelso	Yes, genius, in this metaphor the hospital is a chicken.
20700	J.D.	Please, sir, I totally get that.
20701	J.D.'s Thoughts	How could a hospital be a chicken?
20702	Dr. Kelso	Focus on nothing else.
20703	J.D.	What a jerk!
20704	Elliot	Dr. Cox. Ran all those tests on Mr. Landisman.
20705	Dr. Cox	Top-notch work, there, Barbie! She's good! She's very, very, _very_ good!
20706	J.D.	I am a medical professional, and you are not gonna get me to compete with Elliot.
20707	Dr. Cox	Well, Jo-Jo, right now she's winning.
20708	J.D.	Let me know how to get back on top. I'll do anything, even if it means I have to kill somebody!
20709	Dr. Cox	Well, you could start by getting the lightbulb out of this genius's pooper. Impress me.
20710	J.D.	Oh, I'll impress you!
20711	FANTASY	EXAM ROOM
20712	J.D.	Hit the water!
20713	J.D.'s Thoughts	I'll impress him some other way.
20714	J.D.	Doug! Stay positive.
20715	Doug	Awesome!
20716	Molly	Perry! You know, I have a cousin named Perry. But actually, no, he's not my cousin; and, you know, his name isn't Perry, it's...Jeff.
20717	Dr. Cox	That's so funny. I have an uncle named Stop Bothering Me.
20718	Molly	Interesting!
20719	Molly	that I need to start publishing a paper to earn my keep. So I'm gonna do this study about conflict resolution between hospital personnel, and I was wondering if I could observe you?
20720	Dr. Cox	Look, "Doctor," us real doctors are here to work, so there's not a whole lot of conflict. Now, my day is already bad enough on account of I gotta tell Mr. Roman that he
20721	Dr. Cox	That.... Oh, my God. Mr. Roman doesn't need to have surgery. I ne-hever get to give good news!
20722	Molly	Subject elongates words when excited!
20723	Dr. Cox	Mr. Roman, ga-reat news!
20724	Mr. Roman	I don't need surgery! Yeah, Dr. Turk just told me!
20725	Turk	Yeah, you shoulda seen him! He was so happy, he started dancing! Not standing up, but while lying in his bed. It was sort of like buh-buh-buh from like the waist up?
20726	Dr. Cox	You stole my moment. And you will pay.
20727	Molly	Oh, this is good!
20728	Elliot	Molly helped me fill out my chief resident application, so...gonna go give it to Dr. Cox!
20729	Carla	There you go, working girl!
20730	Carla	I've told Elliot a million times that she would be a good chief resident, but she just ignored me.
20731	Nurse Roberts	Maybe she's racist.
20732	Carla	Whatever. It's fine, it's fine. It's not like all my friends are gonna go to Molly for advice.
20733	Nurse Roberts	Mmm-hmm.
20734	Molly	Nurse Roberts, if you still wanna talk about that situation with your husband, we can go to my office now.
20735	Nurse Roberts	'Scuse me.
20736	J.D.'s Narration	When Turk told me he pissed Dr. Cox off by stealing his moment, I decided not to share it with Elliot.
20737	Elliot	Dr. Cox! Can you come take a look at my patient's rash? It's really weird.
20738	Dr. Cox	Ohh, I would love to come take a look at your patient's rash! But, also, if time allows, maybe we could go over some preliminary ideas for your wedding dress.
20739	Elliot	I have sketches in my locker.
20740	Dr. Cox	Pssst! Barbie! Listen carefully, because the policy remains unchanged: Unless someone is dying and puh-lease note _dying_ not _dead_ I'm not interested. And P.S., just a real strong showing for a chief resident candidate. God almighty!
20741	J.D.	Whoooooooooo. Wow. Don't feel bad, you couldn't have seen it coming. Awful, though.
20742	J.D.'s Narration	I didn't feel bad, because a lot of people were playing dirty around here.
20743	Dr. Cox	I've told him all about the surgery, and he is good to go.
20744	Turk	Hey! So whatta you say we yank out that gallbladder?
20745	Mr. Silka	That's the way you tell me I need major surgery!?
20746	Turk	You said you told him!
20747	Dr. Cox	Oh, stop it. Why would I steal your moment? Except for maybe because payback is a bitch.
20748	Carla	Have one, baby. You'll feel better.
20749	Turk	Thank you.
20750	Molly	Turk, I heard your conflict with Dr. Cox escalated? You know, he's already starting to look like the breakout character of my case study? The one that people love to hate?
20751	Carla	Ugh.
20752	Molly	Anyway, in my opinion, it is more effective to address the situation than it is to become self-destructive by over-indulging a sweet tooth.
20753	Turk	She's right.
20754	Carla	You don't have that cookie, we're getting a divorce.
20755	Turk	But baby, I'm not hungry now.
20756	Carla	Eat. It.
20757	Dr. Cox	What?
20758	J.D.	It's 3 o'clock! 3 o'clock's when you announce new chief resident, so we thought you might want
20759	Dr. Cox	Barbie. You're chief resident.
20760	J.D.	Very funny!
20761	Dr. Cox	So not joking.
20762	Elliot	Yay! Oh, my God, now I know how Liza Minelli felt! When she won the Oscar, not when she married that gay, pan-faced alien.
20763	Dr. Cox	Newbie, how ya doin'?
20764	J.D.'s Thoughts	Keep it together. It's be a man time.
20765	J.D.	No, no. I totally understand. Come on, you did what you had to do. You went with your gut; Elliot's a great doctor. I do have three questions, though: Why do you hate me when I show you nothing but love? Who's gonna tell my mom? And what the hell am I supposed to do with ten thousand "John Dorian, Chief Resident" business cards!?!?!
20766	Dr. Cox	Yeah, Scarlett? You're chief resident too.
20767	J.D.	Uh, what now?
20768	Dr. Cox	Well, I figure with her being ridiculously book-smart to the point where she has almost no interpersonal skills, and you being warm and cuddly as an un-potty trained labradoodle and about as useful in high-stress medical situations as an un-potty trained labradoodle _together_ the two of you make one barely passable doctor...slash labradoodle.
20769	J.D.	Wait, so, if we're both gonna be chief residents, why didn't you just say that from the beginning?
20770	Dr. Cox	What, and miss your hall of fame hissy? Not on your life.
20771	J.D.	John Dorian, chief resident.
20772	J.D.	It's just that Elliot and I doing this together is gonna be a little tough we're going through a bit of a rough patch.
20773	Dr. Cox	Shoot, I totally get that. What you need to do is just give each other tons of space. Here, uh, here's your office.
20774	Dr. Cox	Oh! Enjoy.
20775	Dr. Kelso	Maybe I wasn't clear. This patient is important. Translation: Don't pass him off to dumb guy.
20776	Doug	Sir, I take issue with that.
20777	Dr. Kelso	Son, you were gathering a group of large orderlies to get the lightbulb out of the patient by doing what?
20778	Doug	Shaking him like a beach towel.
20779	Dr. Kelso	Goodbye!
20780	Dr. Kelso	Last chance, Perry. Fix this kid.
20781	Dr. Cox	'Course you did.
20782	Todd	Heard this guy's got a lightbulb up his ass.
20783	Dr. Cox	Are are you the the surgical consult?
20784	Todd	No, I'm not even working today. I just want to ask him four questions.
20785	Turk	Whasssup! Dr. Tizzurk is in the hizzouse...!
20786	J.D.'s Narration	Conflict is everywhere. Whether it's out in the open...
20787	J.D.'s Narration	...or bubbling just under the surface.
20788	Molly	You know what I realized by doing this study? Some of the most interesting conflicts are when one of the parties doesn't even realize they're in a fight!
20789	Carla	Really.
20790	J.D.'s Narration	I guess the only thing to do when you're in the middle of it is to hope that nothing makes it worse.
20791	Janitor	Cleaning time!
20792	Janitor	Don't worry, I'll go fast.
20793	J.D.	Owwww!
20794	Janitor	Whoop, that one got away.
20795	J.D.	It burns!
20796	Janitor	Ammonia burns? Hm! Write that down.
20797	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
20798	Elliot	Yes, I'm happy! But I'd be happier if I didn't have to share the job with such a jerk!
20799	J.D.	Elliot. I can hear you.
20800	Molly	You guys, the situation would be perfect for my study.
20801	J.D.	Oh, no.
20802	Molly	Don't worry, Johnny. Everyone's gonna be anonymous, I'm only using initials. You'll be "J.D."
20803	J.D.	Great. Maybe we could make it permanent.
20804	Molly	Johnny!
20805	J.D.'s Thoughts	Of course not.
20806	Molly	The way I see it, you guys can either get past it and talk like adults, or you can behave like petty children.
20807	J.D.'s Narration	We decided to go petty.
20808	Elliot	Okay, instead of sharing you all, we're gonna separate you into two resident teams so that J.D. and I never have to see each other.
20809	J.D.	I'll take Doug.
20810	Doug	YES! Suck on that!
20811	Doug	Thanks, J.D. First pick.
20812	J.D.	Relax, Doug, you're the only one whose name I know.
20813	Elliot	I'll take Indian Elvis.
20814	Indian Elvis	Yes!
20815	Doug	Pick the hot chick.
20816	J.D.	Shut up, Doug!
20817	Hot Chick	Yeah, uh, name's Amy, actually.
20818	J.D.	John Dorian, chief resident. Website's on the back.
20819	Molly	Hey! I got like a two-hour break between patients, do you wanna grab lunch? Or dinner, I'm not really sure what time it is.
20820	J.D.'s Narration	Elliot and I weren't the only ones who decided to go petty.
20821	Carla	Oh! You know what, I have a barbecue to go to. Why don't you meet me there?
20822	Molly	Cool!
20823	Molly	Hey! Are you Todd?
20824	Todd	Oh, yeah.
20825	Molly	Well, Carla said you're having a barbecue.
20826	Todd	No, but stick around, I'll see if we can get something cooking.
20827	Molly	Hi, I'm Molly.
20828	Molly	Aaand you're naked.
20829	Todd	Uhhh-huh.
20830	Molly	Awesome.
20831	Turk	Why don't we just reach up there and tug that bad boy out?
20832	Dr. Cox	It's not a rabbit in a hat. If you tug on it, it's going to break; and if it breaks, he's going to need surgery; and if you perform it, then, of course, he's going to need a casket. Sooo, why don't you just play quietly in your area until the crowd arrives.
20833	Turk	What crowd? I thought nobody wanted to take the case?
20834	Dr. Cox	At first. But now that it's become a bit of a hospital mystery, every jackass in the joint is going to want to come in here and give their two cents worth.
20835	Dr. Mickhead	If we could just find the lamp the bulb came from.
20836	Odd Doc	Leon's trained to retrieve things.
20837	Dr. Zeltzer	That's why my wife and I use candles.
20838	Turk	Zeltzer, you are hands-down the most disturbing man I've ever met in my life.
20839	Dr. Zeltzer	Oh, stop it.
20840	Dr. Cox	That's it! I want everybody to get out who is not an expert on lightbulbs! Go on! Get out! Out out out out out out out out out out out!
20841	Dr. Cox	What're you still doing here?
20842	Janitor	What you have there is an A21 bulb on a E26 base. Running a hundred watts, putting out about a hundred and thirty volts.
20843	Turk	Get over here, you're helping me.
20844	Dr. Cox	Not so fast, cowboy. You're working with me, tall man.
20845	Janitor	Mmmm, actually, no. If I had the time, maybe, but I've got a room to clean.
20846	Elliot	Keep up, people! We got pre-rounds to do!
20847	J.D.	Okay, she's gone.
20848	J.D.	Now, I've heard some rumors there's been some fraternizing with some of Dr. Reid's residents. Now, I don't want to mention any names...but, Slobodan, enough of that crap!
20849	Doug	Watch your ass.
20850	J.D.	Now, come on, you nerds!
20851	Molly	Carla, Todd has something he wants to say to you.
20852	Todd	I'm sorry if I ever demeaned you, Carla. You see, my feelings about women were warped by a very unhealthy relationship with my mother. We made out once.
20853	Molly	That's good, Todd. Keep going.
20854	Todd	Monique! I owe you an apology....
20855	Carla	You fixed the Todd?
20856	Molly	Well, without regular therapy, it'll probably only last...a week?
20857	Carla	Excuse me?
20858	Molly	Oh! You're not mad at me!
20859	Carla	Why did you just close your eyes at me?
20860	Molly	I've never been able to wink.
20861	Carla	Ohh. I'm not mad.
20862	Molly	Cool! You're obviously very stubborn and very proud, but you're nice so eventually you're gonna tell me.
20863	Carla	No, I won't.
20864	Molly	Let go of that anger!
20865	Molly	Not my office.
20866	Molly	How's it going in here?
20867	&	GO AWAY!
20868	Molly	Wow, you kinda harmonized on that. That was cool.
20869	Molly	Hm.
20870	&	I GOT SOMETHING TO SAY!
20871	Dr. Cox	I'm sorry about the gallbladder thing this morning!
20872	Turk	DAMMIT!
20873	Dr. Cox	It's just, you surgeons ride in here on your white horse and you save the day, and the best news that I ever get to give everybody, anybody, ever, is "Oh, by the way, ma'am, were you aware that that breathing tube you have in your neck also comes in day-glo pink?"
20874	Come on, look, bottom line	I really needed a win, I did. And I finally got one and you ya you stole it, man!
20875	Turk	I needed one, too!
20876	Janitor	Boo-hoo. Where's my win? Think anybody thanks me for cleaning bathrooms?
20877	Turk	Janitor, the bathrooms are filthy.
20878	Janitor	Well, no one was thanking me, so I quit cleaning 'em.
20879	Dr. Cox	Holy cow. Do you realize if we could get a tight enough clamp around the bulb and then just
20880	Janitor	No, no, no, you'll break the thing!
20881	Janitor	Look, here's the thing about lightbulbs, okay? They're structurally weak at the narrow end, but the round end is surprisingly strong.
20882	Turk	So if we could get behind the bulb....
20883	Janitor	I see where you're headed! We go down through the mouth!
20884	Dr. Cox	Your turn's over. All we need to do is thread an angioplasty balloon past the bulb, inflate it...
20885	&	...and then pull.
20886	Janitor	...pull it.
20887	Janitor	I concur.
20888	Dr. Cox	Doctor!
20889	Turk	Doctor!
20890	Dr. Cox	Doctor!
20891	Janitor	Doctor!
20892	Turk	Doctor!
20893	Janitor	Nnooo.
20894	Nurse Roberts	Doug wanted me to give this patient five hundred thousand milligrams of Morphine. I thought I'd check with you before I killed a man.
20895	J.D.	Unbelievable, Doug.
20896	Elliot	Don't worry, I just came to check on my patients.
20897	J.D.	Do whatever you want, just don't come over to my area.
20898	Elliot	You couldn't pay me to come over to your area.
20899	J.D.	Well, I wouldn't pay you.
20900	Elliot	Well, you don't have enough money.
20901	J.D.	It just so happens I have a rich uncle who'd do anything for me, but I'd never call in that favor just to pay you to come over to my area!
20902	J.D.'s Thoughts	Got her!
20903	Nurse Roberts	I hate to interrupt, but I think you need to take a look at this man.
20904	J.D.	Elliot, he's in V-tach.
20905	Elliot	Get the crash cart.
20906	J.D.	We need a one milligram Epi.
20907	J.D.'s Narration	The best thing about this place is that when someone's really in trouble, all the pettiness melts away.
20908	Turk	What are you doing?
20909	Molly	Oh, um, I'm tired of trying to find my office, so I just set up shop here!
20910	Turk	Oh! Okay, that's not weird.
20911	Look	If every once in a while you could let her be the one to give the advice? You guys might end up being friends.
20912	Molly	I can do that.
20913	Molly	And tell Carla that you did well.
20914	Turk	You truly underestimate how proud my wife is. If she knew I was here, she'd kill me.
20915	Molly	All right.
20916	Carla	What happened to the part about how much I help people around here?
20917	Turk	Wait a second, she said I did well!
20918	Dr. Cox	Turtlehead! You're gonna wanna get a piece of this! Come on.
20919	Turk	Where'd you get the coat?
20920	Janitor	I earned it. Let's get our moment.
20921	Mr. Porter	Thanks for all the hard work, Bob.
20922	Dr. Kelso	Glad to do it. Oh, and, uh, Bart, I think Lyle might be ready for that rough-sex-play talk you had with your other boys.
20923	Dr. Kelso	Too late!
20924	J.D.	Can you imagine us trying to do that three years ago?
20925	Elliot	I know.
20926	J.D.	Well, I remember hiding in a supply closet.
20927	Elliot	That's the one.
20928	J.D.'s Narration	Ultimately, conflict is resolved by remembering why you were friends in the first place.
20929	Nurse Roberts	Don't hang up, Lester.
20930	Molly	You should talk to her. You know her better.
20931	J.D.'s Narration	Or by swallowing your pride.
20932	Carla	I know what you're doing. But I'm okay with it.
20933	Dr. Cox	He's coming. He's coming! Get your ass out here!
20934	J.D.'s Narration	Or by uniting against a moment-stealing common enemy who took credit for your ingenious method of de-bulbing a patient's keister!
20935	Dr. Kelso	Good Lord!
20936	J.D.'s Narration	In the end, though, it doesn't really matter how you get there. As long as you're friends again.
20937	J.D.	I miss this. This, like, hanging out, you know?
20938	Elliot	Me too.
20939	J.D.	We should go get coffee.
20940	Elliot	We're having coffee.
20941	J.D.	No, no, I mean like, like outside coffee real world coffee.
20942	J.D.	The point is, we should...hang out outside the hospital sometime.
20943	Elliot	J.D., I still need time. I know that's gonna be hard for you because you like to fix everything right way, but...you just do the best you can, okay?
20944	J.D.	Is it fixed now?
20945	Elliot	Nope.
20946	J.D.'s Thoughts	Shoot!
20947	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
20948	J.D.'s Narration	Today I walk in here not as a resident but as a chief. Chief resident! Chief resident Dorian! Chiefy chiefy chief!
20949	Janitor	What's that, your new, uh, cool guy walk?
20950	J.D.	No, I have rocks in my shoe.
20951	J.D.'s Thoughts	Wow, that's a lot of rocks. I gotta stop taking that short-cut through the quarry.
20952	J.D.'s Narration	Anyway, the best thing about my new job is that I command a lot more respect.
20953	J.D.	Chief resident in the house! Everybody say hey-ay!
20954	Councilman	HEEEY-AAAY!
20955	J.D.'s Narration	Even though Councilman Donovan was handcuffed to that chair because once again he was flying high on crystal meth, his respect felt good. Honestly, it's the reason I keep voting for him.
20956	Jordan	Have a good day. Try not to torture anyone so much that they take their own lives.
20957	Dr. Cox	I'll try. You know, you're not looking as processed and overly-medicated as usual.
20958	Jordan	That is so sweet!
20959	Dr. Cox	Come here!
20960	J.D.'s Narration	It was the same old Dr. Cox and Jordan. The weird thing was, there was something underneath it they were happy.
20961	Dr. Kelso	We have some very exciting news.
20962	Dr. Cox	Don't tell me you and Sweaty Teddy here are gonna finally have that commitment ceremony you've been dreaming about?
20963	Dr. Kelso	Perry, even if I went that way and believe me, there were nights in the service when it didn't sound so far-fetched Ted is hardly my type.
20964	Ted the Lawyer	I beg to differ. I've seen Enid.
20965	Dr. Kelso	What?
20966	Ted the Lawyer	Nothing.Dr. Cox, remember a few years back, you asked me to look over your divorce papers to make sure "that slag would die a penniless whore"?
20967	Jordan	Hmmm.
20968	Ted the Lawyer	Sorry.
20969	Jordan	It's okay, "slag" is kind of his pet-name for me.
20970	Ted the Lawyer	Anyway, I was also going through a divorce she's with my brother now; he's nine inches shorter than me but he wears a piece the point is, you and I signed the wrong papers, which technically means you two are still married and so am I.
20971	Dr. Kelso	Well, mazel tovs all around!
20972	J.D.'s Narration	I've never seen Dr. Cox and Jordan speechless before. It was neat-o!
20973	Janitor	Just so you know, I think this chief resident thing has made you a little too big for your britches? Soo...from now on I'm gonna be your britches shrinker.
20974	J.D.	Oh, what, is that supposed to intimidate me or something?
20975	Janitor	No. I had to do it anyway.
20976	J.D.	What possible reason could you have for breaking your broom in half?
20977	Randall	Thanks, bro.
20978	Janitor	Any other questions? Smart guy?
20979	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
20980	Turk	What's up, ladies.
20981	Turk	What's up with these rocks!?
20982	J.D.	HAH! You've been graveled!
20983	Turk	"Graveled"??
20984	J.D.	Yeah, it's a new game I made up this morning when I had rocks in my shoes.
20985	Turk	I like it.
20986	J.D.	Better than Play-Doh Pants?
20987	Turk	Play-Doh Pants became all about the money.
20988	J.D.	Wise!
20989	J.D.'s Narration	It felt good cheering Turk up. See, now that I'm chief studly, I was making a lot more money than him. Needless to say it was a time to be extra sensitive.
20990	J.D.	Hey, you remember how I make more money than you now?
20991	Turk	Yeah?
20992	J.D.	Here's five bucks for remembering. Anyway, I was thinking about spending some of my extra ducats on one of those classy suits we always wanted!
20993	Turk	You mean the leather purple jumpsuit Eddie Murphy wore in 'Raw'?
20994	J.D.	You know it, dawg!
20995	Turk	That's cold!
20996	Turk	Look, I gotta go. I've got a new attending and he hates it when we're late. Plus he's a question-talker.
20997	J.D.	What's a question-talker?
20998	Dr. Lemmon	Do I want you to be on time, Dr. Turk? Yes I do. Am I going to remember this? Of course I am.
20999	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21000	Carla	Miss Myers is ready to have her bandages removed now.
21001	Dr. Cox	Who do you mean, dashboard-face?
21002	Carla	Yeah, I think she prefers "Miss Myers."
21003	Dr. Cox	Well then she probably shouldn't be checking her e-mail while she's driving ninety miles an hour.
21004	Molly	Hey, sorry I'm late.
21005	Dr. Cox	We weren't waiting for you.
21006	Molly	Great! I'm on time!See, I think as a psychiatrist that I should be there when Miss Myers' bandages get removed, because her accident was traumatic enough. But with reconstructive facial surgery on top of that? In my professional opinion: Yikes!
21007	Dr. Cox	Honey, if you are coming in, I just might go ahead and phone up my pool-man and my architect so we can populate the room with just as many useless people as possible.
21008	Molly	Great! My mom's in town, should I call her?
21009	Carla	Hah! Haha. That was good.
21010	Dr. Cox	Okay, Miss Myers, I'm gonna go ahead and get these bandages off and make sure the plastic surgeons have left your face just as beautiful as it always was.
21011	Miss Myers	Oh, you're so nice. Are you married?
21012	Carla	Oh! He is as of this morning!
21013	Molly	Really? I thought he was divorced?
21014	Carla	No, child, the papers didn't go through!
21015	Dr. Cox	You know what? I've got a son, I don't fantasize about Jordan dying as much anymore, and, even though it wasn't planned, I'm actually pretty happy about the way this whole marriage thing has worked out. Sooo, would you please stop your chirping and step away from my personal life?
21016	Molly	So what's his wife like?
21017	Carla	So scary!
21018	Molly	Mm.
21019	Dr. Cox	You go ahead and have a look there.
21020	Miss Myers	Wow.
21021	Dr. Cox	You look fantastic, you do.
21022	Dr. Cox	Doctor?
21023	Molly	Really fantastic.
21024	Dr. Cox	Thank God you were here!

21026	J.D.'s Narration	Since Elliot and I are both chief residents, I'm trying not to make it all about me.
21027	J.D.	John Dorian, Chief Resident.
21028	J.D.'s Narration	You know, unless there's someone I could doink.
21029	J.D.	Hey, uh, you need to move your car it's my day to have the parking spot.
21030	Elliot	J.D., you have a scooter! Why do you even need a parking spot?
21031	J.D.	Mmmm, it sends a message.
21032	J.D.'s Narration	Just because I lured her away from her perfect boyfriend and then dumped her doesn't mean my scooter, Sasha, needs to suffer.
21033	J.D.	What are you doing?
21034	Janitor	Just making it official.Chief. Co-Chief.
21035	J.D.	You can try as hard as you want, that is never gonna stick.
21036	Janitor	Hm.
21037	Resident	Oh! And that's Co-Chief Resident Dorian over there!
21038	J.D.	Dammit! You are quick!
21039	Turk	Dammit, I got an appendectomy again?
21040	Todd	Sweet! I get the duah d duoh duo...duooh
21041	Turk	Duodenojejunostomy, man. What's wrong with you?
21042	Todd	So I can't pronounce it. Try and be a little more sensitive, okay? New bra, Janice? 'Cause it's working! Besides, the only reason I'm getting all these great procedures is because nobody's died on me in like three months!
21043	Turk	Listen, man, you never have to apologize for being on a hot-streak. I'm psyched for you! And I wouldn't take those procedures away even if I could.
21044	Turk	Sir, would you mind giving me the duodenojejunostomy instead of the Todd?
21045	Dr. Lemmon	Am I impressed by your moxie? You bet'cha. Am I going to reward it? Not a chance.
21046	Turk	This Todd thing is killing me.Where's your lunch?
21047	J.D.	Ahhh! Thank you, Barry! Hey! That's for Barry Jr.!
21048	J.D.	What? The little guy's in leg braces.
21049	Jordan	Hi. I visited my safety deposit box today. Guess what I found?
21050	Dr. Cox	My grandfather's purple heart!
21051	Jordan	Please, I sold that years ago to pay for these.
21052	Dr. Cox	Oh...!
21053	Jordan	Mm. Our wedding rings.
21054	Dr. Cox	Holy cow!
21055	Jordan	What do you think?
21056	Dr. Cox	Are you kidding me? I'm gonna wear this the rest of my life!
21057	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, marriage can make the rest of your life seem longer.
21058	Jordan	So you're just going to, uh, fall asleep right after for the rest of my life?
21059	Dr. Cox	So I'm supposed to pay for your Botox the rest of my life?
21060	Jordan	I'm not sure I want to watch you drink a beer while I'm holding the baby for the rest of my life!
21061	Dr. Cox	Look, Attila
21062	Dr. Cox	there's no way in hell that I'm gonna listen to you complain about the rest of your life for the rest of my life, you got that?Jordan: Yeah, not listening. By the way, now that we're married again, we've gotta make out new wills in case one of us dies.
21063	Dr. Cox	Oh, God, I hope it's me.
21064	J.D.'s Narration	Yep, there was definitely trouble in paradise.
21065	Janitor	Would Co-Chief Dorian please report to the I.C.U.? Co-Chief Dorian? Co-Chief?
21066	J.D.	Well, Mrs. Covello, your CAT-scan showed a small rectal tumor, so I want to schedule a low anterior resection. But don't worry, we have an amazing surgical team here, okay?
21067	Mrs. Covello	That means a lot coming from the co-chief resident!
21068	J.D.	Heh.
21069	J.D.'s Thoughts	How did she hear? She's been in a coma for two weeks!
21070	J.D.	Dammit.
21071	Turk	Hey, buddy! Can I talk to you for a second?
21072	J.D.	Sure.
21073	Turk	I know the Todd's doing her resection, but if you send her down right now, he's a little busy so it'd have to be me.
21074	J.D.	What's the Todd doing?
21075	Turk	Yeah, well, you know the city surveyor is outside taking pictures of the hospital for the zoning commission?
21076	J.D.	Yeah?
21077	Turk	I told him they were shooting a Sacred Heart calendar.
21078	J.D.	Ha!
21079	FANTASY	PARKING LOT
21080	Todd	Gentlemen! Say hello to June!
21081	Todd	How about a sneak-peek of July!
21082	J.D.	I don't know, Turk. It's a little early for me to start pulling strings I just got this co-chief job. Dammit, now I'm saying it!
21083	Turk	Come on, man, get me back in the game!
21084	J.D.	Mmmggghhh! Okay!
21085	Turk	O-kay!
21086	Turk	Okay!

21089	Molly	I think she's a little upset she doesn't look the way she used to.
21090	Dr. Cox	Why? How did she used to look?
21091	Dr. Cox	Oh, dear ugly.
21092	Dr. Cox	Oh, whatta you know, the paging of the shrew.
21093	Molly	Look, why don't you just talk to her.
21094	Dr. Cox	Mm-hm. Why don't you just
21095	Molly	Mind my own business. I know, your life is your life, and it's not my job to fix it, unless of course you ask me to. And, man, would I get in there, 'cause I'm a good shrink and you, my friend, are a walking disaster.Shall we?
21096	Dr. Cox	So, now, Miss Myers, um, how are you feeling?
21097	Miss Myers	I was wondering...if it were possible to have surgery again?
21098	Dr. Cox	Hi, sweetie, I'm in a tunnel. Look, your body's been through an enormous amount of trauma, and I can't recommend you go racing back in to surgery. Now, I guarantee you, if you just give it time you'll be happy with the way you look.
21099	Dr. Cox	Oh, my God.
21100	Dr. Cox	WHAT!?
21101	Miss Myers	I just don't look like myself. I know I had a big nose and droopy eyes, but they were my nose and my droopy eyes, you know?
21102	Molly	Tell me more about yourself.
21103	J.D.'s Narration	Around here, there's always at least one person that'll come through for you.
21104	J.D.'s Narration	In Turk's case, that was me.J.D.: Hey, Elliot! Hey, I want to talk to you about this whole chief resident thing.
21105	Elliot	What about it?
21106	J.D.	Well, as you may have heard from the loudspeaker, some residents, the janitor, my mother, your mother, and a...a coma patient, um, I'm being referred to as the "co-" chief resident. I think we should either both go with "co-chief" or "chief." Don't you...co-agree?
21107	Lonnie	Excuse me. We're working up this patient for a hypercoagulable state with a prolonged PTT? What's our next step?
21108	J.D.	Well, that's easy, Lonnie, what you want to do
21109	Lonnie	I'd like my answer from the chief resident.
21110	J.D.	We're both chief residents. Isn't that right, Dr. Reid?
21111	Elliot	With a prolonged PTT, you'd want to do a one-to-one mixing study.
21112	Lonnie	'S why she's the chief. You're the co-chief.
21113	J.D.	Shut up, Lonnie!
21114	Lonnie	You shut up!
21115	Molly	Obviously for your ex-wife, just the illusion of hair is important.
21116	Molly	Excuse me.
21117	Ted the Lawyer	So you're saying it had nothing to do with my impotence?
21118	Molly	Dr. Cox, I was wondering if we could talk about Miss Myers in my office?
21119	Dr. Cox	Yeah, I make it a point to never enter a shrink's office unless I'm planning on grossly overpaying somebody for telling me something that I already know.
21120	Molly	Look, you're obviously really distracted by the situation with your marriage
21121	Dr. Cox	Something I already know, what do I owe? Will ten bucks cover it?
21122	Molly	Oh, yeah!
21123	Dr. Cox	Oh, you're gonna hang onto that?
21124	Molly	Yeah, you know, I forgot my lunch money, and it's kielbasa day in the cafeteria. Kielbasa!
21125	Molly	Love it.Anyway, Miss Myers really values your opinion, but I don't think you're even trying to understand how she feels.
21126	Dr. Cox	Look, if I ever want your advice on one of my patients, I'll ask. But do not hold your breath, unless of course you can hold it for a really long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long time.
21127	Molly	I can't, I used to smoke.
21128	Molly	Kielbasa. Yes!

21133	J.D.	Dammit! I used 'em all up watching 'Barber Shop 9'.
21134	Turk	Okay, that's it, and I'll get you later.
21135	J.D.	How'd surgery go?
21136	Turk	Oh, you know, I was on top of my game.
21137	J.D.'s Narration	It can be scary to stick your neck out for a friend. That's why it's a huge relief when they come through.
21138	J.D.	How's she doing?
21139	Turk	Uh...unfortunately she didn't make it.
21140	J.D.'s Thoughts	What?
21141	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21142	J.D.	What do you mean she died?
21143	Turk	J.D., I did everything I could. Even my attending thought I did great. He said, "Do I think you did great? Yes I do!"
21144	J.D.'s Narration	I couldn't help wonder if by taking that patient from Todd and giving her to Turk, I had toyed with fate.
21145	Turk	I know that look. You're wondering if you toyed with fate!
21146	J.D.	How could you know that look? It's a brand new look!
21147	Turk	What do you think Todd would've done that I didn't?
21148	FANTASY	O.R.
21149	Nurse	Doctor, her heart stopped.
21150	Todd	No!
21151	Todd	Here!
21152	Todd	I'm gay!
21153	Nurse	I knew it.
21154	Turk	Oh my God! That's your "the Todd would've pulled his own heart out" look!
21155	J.D.	Okay, we have been spending way too much time together.
21156	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21157	Dr. Cox	Guess what there, wifey. You can't be a pain in the ass if I don't have a phone.
21158	Dr. Cox	Oh, ohh! Hi, sweetie!
21159	Jordan	Save it. I was just calling to tell you that I'm taking Jack and staying at my mother's for a few months.
21160	Dr. Cox	But who's going to be looking after him when you and your mother go out marauding for flesh?
21161	Jordan	Thank you for making this so much easier, Perry.
21162	Dr. Cox	Jordan. Jordan, come on, Jordan. Ahhh.
21163	Carla	Are you okay?
21164	Dr. Cox	Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna go check on Miss Myers.
21165	Carla	Molly sent her down to surgery.
21166	Dr. Cox	Oh-ho-ho, wrong day, new chick!
21167	J.D.'s Narration	In a hospital, it's hard not to let your personal life affect your professional life.
21168	Turk's Thoughts	Forget about J.D. You're just as good as the Todd. You got this.
21169	Turk	All right, people! I believe we're done here.
21170	Dr. Lemmon	Did you just sew your gown into the patient? Yeah, ya did.
21171	Janitor	Hey! Hey, someone! Hey! Randall was in the air conditioning vent, and it collapsed on him! Buddy!
21172	Randall	Co-chief. Co-chief!
21173	Janitor	Hey, you fixed him! Come on, buddy!J.D.'s Thoughts: That's it!
21174	J.D.	Dr. Kelso, could you help me out? People have been referring to me as the co-chief resident.
21175	Dr. Kelso	Well, it sounds like something you should take up with the chief resident.
21176	J.D.	But I'm the chief resident. Look, Dr. Reid's check is made out to the chief resident, and and mine's made out to the co-chief resident. But we both make the same amount.
21177	Dr. Kelso	You're right. Dr. Reid, you should be making ten dollars more a month, and of course, Dr. Dorian, you should be making ten dollars less. I know it's not much, but it's largely to symbolize the difference in your levels.
21178	Elliot	Coolio!
21179	Dr. Kelso	Coolio, indeed.
21180	J.D.'s Thoughts	I could spend all day worrying about what just happened, but I have more important things to do.
21181	J.D.	Hey, man. Look what I confiscated from one of the kids in Pediatrics.
21182	Turk	OWWW!
21183	J.D.	What, too hot?
21184	Turk	YEAH!
21185	J.D.	Sorry.
21186	Turk	Not in the mood!
21187	J.D.	Okay, well, look, we both might have had bad days, but I got just the thing that's gonna cheer us up.
21188	J.D.	Ahhh? Dream come true, right!
21189	Turk	Do you really think I want this suit?
21190	Turk	Well, I do. But not from you!
21191	J.D.	Oh, now I get it. You're just mad because I make more money than you.
21192	Turk	No, I'm mad because of that surgery today. You doubted me.
21193	J.D.	You are such a wuss!
21194	J.D.	Turk, come on.
21195	J.D.	Ah, these things chafe. Now I know why Eddie called it "Raw."
21196	J.D.	Carla! Do you have any powder?
21197	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21198	Dr. Cox	You. You went behind my back.
21199	Molly	I gave you every opportunity to do the right thing.
21200	Dr. Cox	I'll tell you what, there, Miss Manners: Why don't you go ahead and gulp down that bear-sized bite, and then we'll talk.
21201	Molly	Mm-hmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm! Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm-mm. MM! Yummy! Man, that is great kielbasa. But you can't really screw up kielbasa, can you? So, um, where were we?
21202	Dr. Cox	Honest to God, I can't remember.
21203	Molly	Oh, right, Miss Myers. The plastic surgeon said it was safe to operate, and Miss Myers really liked her old face. And you don't have to be a psychiatrist to see, Perry, that if you used to be truly happy and now you're not, then you should go back to the way it was when you were happy. Isn't that what you would do?
21204	Dr. Cox	Yeah....
21205	Dr. Cox	Jordan! Will you...will you divorce me?
21206	Jordan	Ohh, I thought you'd never ask!
21207	Elliot	Listen, I probably shoulda put a stop to all this co-chief stuff.
21208	J.D.	What co-chief stuff? I haven't even been thinking about it.
21209	Elliot	Look, J.D., ever since you dumped me, everyone around here's been treating me like some kind of a victim. It's like, "Ohh, look at poor Elliot going home alone." Or, "Ohh, look at poor Elliot riding a tandem bike by herself." That's not something I normally do, I just really wanted ice cream the other night, my car was out of gas, and that's the bike the Gundersons loaned me. They do everything together....
21210	J.D.	Okay....
21211	Elliot	The point is it was nice being the one chief resident for a while, you know?
21212	J.D.	She's got fingers like biceps!
21213	Ted the Lawyer	And so, by the power vested in me by the American Bar Association, I pronounce you ex-husband and ex-wife. You may now do whatever the hell you want!
21214	Jordan	I've never been this happy.
21215	Dr. Cox	Me neither.
21216	Carla	You have no chance of being normal.
21217	J.D.	Mm-mm.
21218	J.D.	Thirsty, huh?
21219	Ted the Lawyer	Helps the tears taste less bitter.
21220	J.D.	Cheers.
21221	J.D.	So! How you guys gonna celebrate your divorce?
21222	Turk	By not inviting you!
21223	J.D.	Oh my God! Dude! I doubted you for a second, why are you so mad?
21224	Turk	Maybe I needed you to believe in me!
21225	Carla	I believe in you, baby.
21226	Turk	Yeah, but we're married that doesn't count.
21227	Carla	What the? Ow, ow, ow, what?
21228	J.D.	Did you, uh...?
21229	Turk	Yeah, she's been graveled.
21230	J.D.	Nice work.Look, man, it was one second of doubt, okay? Since when do you care what anybody else thinks?
21231	Turk	I don't. I care what you think. Since the day I met you, you've...treated me like I was the man, like I could accomplish everything. This is gonna sound lame, but
21232	Softball Player	I've got it!
21233	Turk	your being like that's one of the reasons I've gotten to where I am.
21234	J.D.	Wow. That's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.
21235	J.D.'s Narration	In the end, every relationship needs maintenance.
21236	Turk	Hey, Ted. Get out the sun, man.
21237	Ted the Lawyer	You owe me money!
21238	J.D.'s Narration	...Whether it's the smallest gesture...
21239	Dr. Cox	Hey, Doctor. Doctor!Want to, uh, you wanna take a look at the guy in 302 and tell me whether or not you think he's really sick or just bonkers?
21240	Molly	Are you actually asking my opinion?
21241	Dr. Cox	Well, I'm gonna ignore it, but...yeah, knock yourself out.
21242	J.D.'s Narration	...or just picking up back where you left off.
21243	Turk	I'm a little nervous about surgery tomorrow.
21244	J.D.	Aw, you'll kick ass.
21245	Carla	So are you guys gonna go out tonight?
21246	Turk	No, we're gonna stay in.
21247	Carla	Well, I'll be in the bedroom with all the straight people.
21248	J.D.	Are your giblets warm?
21249	Turk	Like a Christmas ham!
21250	J.D.	Same!
21251	J.D.'s Narration	The bottom line is that if you care about someone, it's pretty easy to make the sacrifice.
21252	Elliot	Wow. Thanks, J.D.
21253	Elliot	Ow!
21254	J.D.	And she's just been graveled!
21255	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21256	J.D.'s Narration	Being the new doctor at a hospital can be difficult. That's why it's always nice when someone takes the time to reach out and befriend you.
21257	Doctor	Hey! I'm Ron, I'm a new doctor here.
21258	J.D.	Hey, Ron, the I Don't Care ward's down there.
21259	J.D.'s Narration	Anyway, the person who reached out to Molly...was Elliot.
21260	Elliot	Hey, do you wanna go down to Little Tokyo and do karaoke with me tonight?
21261	Molly	Do people with trichotillomania compulsively pull their hair out?
21262	Elliot	Do they?
21263	Molly	Yeah!
21264	Elliot	Cool. 'Cause inviting you to karaoke is kind of a big deal to me. I'm a little shy about my "-aoke." Heh.
21265	Molly	I'm sure you have nothing to be embarrassed about.
21266	Elliot	Oh, I don't know. I'm pretty tone-deaf. And I do these, like, kick moves that I don't think people really get. Plus I sometimes wear a cape.
21267	J.D.'s Thoughts	It's not.
21268	J.D.	Ooh, Dr. Cox, can I ask you something?
21269	Dr. Cox	The answer is yes, it was me who saw you doing leg lifts in the gym on that inflatable ball. It was quite the display of girl power. Absolutely loved the leg warmers!
21270	J.D.	First of all, they were just big socks, okay? And secondly, if you need to do some laundry, here's the washboard, right?
21271	Dr. Cox	What do you want?
21272	J.D.	As co-chief resident, I've noticed that some of my residents are a little overwhelmed. And I-I-I think it would be nice if you gave 'em one of your patented pep-talks, you know?
21273	Dr. Cox	I'll be more than glad to give your residents a little pep-talk.
21274	Dr. Cox	Each and every one of you is going to kill a patient. At some point during your residency you will screw up, they will die, and it will be burned into your conscience forever. Hell, take pee-pants, here
21275	Doug	"Pee-pants."
21276	Dr. Cox	he just might go ahead and get himself a good clean kill this morning, seeing as his patient, Mrs. Samson, is in DKA and he hasn't been tracking her phosphate level. Her phosphate level. Her phosphate level.
21277	J.D.	Doug!!! Stop writing and go!
21278	Dr. Cox	That young man has killed so many patients, I'm starting to think he just might be a government operative.
21279	J.D.	Thank you...thank you, Dr. Cox.... Uhh, okay, guys, pizza and punch in the penthouse.
21280	J.D.	Doug!
21281	J.D.	Wrong patient one bed over.
21282	Doug	Hey there!
21283	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21284	Turk	This is like my eleventh slice.
21285	J.D.	Cannonball this!
21286	Turk	Mm.
21287	Turk	That's the good stuff!
21288	J.D.	So anyway, after Dr. Cox scared them, no one wanted pizza or punch. Except for Doug, who'd worked up a hearty appetite neglecting Mrs. Samson into a coma.
21289	Carla	Turk! What is Rowdy doing in my closet?
21290	Turk	He's guarding your shoes, baby!
21291	Carla	He almost gave me a heart attack!
21292	Turk	Baby, could you do me a favor and not hold him by the haunches like that? Yeah, he has hip dysplasia.
21293	J.D.	He's a pure-bred it's genetic.
21294	Carla	She releases Rowdy from her grip, dropping him to the floor.
21295	Carla	I am sick of that creepy thing! I want him out of my house!
21296	Turk	Wow, isn't that a shocker, you don't care about something that's important to me. You know what? Why don't you just throw him out?
21297	J.D.	Don't listen to him! He's drunk on cheese!
21298	Turk	And don't think Rowdy doesn't know what's going on here!
21299	Carla	What's he gonna do?
21300	J.D.	Easy, boy. She ain't worth it.
21301	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21302	J.D.	So, Mrs. Carter, it turns out your fever was just a reaction to the anesthetic we gave you during your cataract surgery. I'm sending you home.
21303	Mrs. Carter	Can I drive my trans-am?
21304	J.D.	That's not up to me, Mrs. Carter. It's up to the police and the owner of those horses you killed.
21305	Mrs. Carter	Ohhh, they were everywhere!
21306	J.D.	You were on a race-track, Mrs. Carter.
21307	Elliot	I don't get why Turk was so upset about Rowdy. I mean, he's just a creepy, stuffed, stupid yellow dead dog.
21308	Elliot	Too many adjectives?
21309	Molly	Well, I'm sure he's more than a pet to Turk. I mean he's basically a link to his childhood.
21310	Carla	He bought him eight years ago at a garage sale.
21311	Molly	Oh, well, then he's just a Nutter Butter.
21312	Carla	Still...I think I really hurt his feelings.
21313	Elliot	Maybe you should do something nice for Rowdy. Like get him cleaned.
21314	Carla	Hmm.
21315	Groomer 1	Mm-mm-mm.
21316	Groomer 2	Nope.
21317	Carla	Your sign doesn't say live dog groomer!
21318	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21319	J.D.'s Narration	As doctors, we always take patients' histories, even though there usually aren't a lot of surprises.
21320	Elliot	And, Mr. Phillips, do you exercise?
21321	Mr. Phillips	Yoga every morning.
21322	Elliot	Ugh, I can't do yoga all that deep breathing. I hate breathing. Except, you know, to live. Umm, do you drink?
21323	Mr. Phillips	Occasional glass of wine with dinner.
21324	Elliot	And any drug use?
21325	Mr. Phillips	Been on and off heroin for the last eight years, but I've been clean for the last six months. See? Look, no track marks.
21326	Kid	Way to go, daddy!
21327	Mr. Phillips	'S my biggest fan!
21328	Elliot	Heh. Umm.... Do you smoke cigarettes?
21329	Mr. Phillips	No way.
21330	Elliot	Of course not. Those things'll kill ya.
21331	J.D.	Mr. Daniels, some fluid has gathered near your heart, so I'm gonna schedule a periocardiocentesis and drain it with a needle.
21332	Mr. Daniels	Someone's gonna stick a needle in my chest?
21333	J.D.	Not just someone Dr. de Man.
21334	Mr. Daniels	Who is Dr. de Man?
21335	J.D.	Say it...say it without the "Dr."
21336	Mr. Daniels	Who's Mr. de Man?
21337	J.D.	No, just say the the last name.
21338	Mr. Daniels	Who's de Man?
21339	J.D.	I'm de Man!
21340	J.D.'s Thoughts	All right, now that you've got his confidence, drive it home.
21341	J.D.	So I'll go ahead and schedule the procedure.
21342	Mr. Daniels	If you think it's the right thing to do.
21343	J.D.	I do.
21344	J.D.	Dr. Cox, I want to thank you for that "everyone's a murderer" speech. Nice scare tactic. Unfortunately, my residents have stopped eating.
21345	Dr. Cox	That wasn't a scare tactic, Portia! Eventually everyone commits a sin of omission or doesn't act quickly enough, and somebody kicks the bucket. It's really...it's really not a question of "if" it's a question of "when."
21346	J.D.'s Thoughts	It's strange. Even though a lot of patients have died under my care, I don't think I've killed any of them....
21347	J.D.	Heaven's a diner?
21348	Mrs. Tanner	Get anything you want, dear.
21349	J.D.	Ooh! Maybe I'll have some flapjacks!
21350	Elaine	They don't have those.
21351	J.D.	No flapjacks in heaven!?! Are flapjacks evil?
21352	Mr. Bursky	No.
21353	Mr. Simon	I mean, you weren't a great doctor.
21354	Elaine	He was nervous.
21355	Mrs. Tanner	Oh, like a little bird!
21356	J.D.	You know what? I left my wallet back on earth.
21357	J.D.	Haha! Suckers!
21358	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21359	Janitor	Heard you're trying to clean a dead dog.
21360	Carla	Yeah, who told you that?
21361	Janitor	Mmm, the wind.... Blonde doctor.
21362	Carla	Oh.
21363	Janitor	I can clean it for you.
21364	Carla	Why would you do that?
21365	Janitor	I don't know.... Still a little drunk from breakfast. Plus, taxidermy used to be kind a...hobby of mine. You know, till the state took my license away.
21366	Carla	How come?
21367	Ted the Lawyer	What happened to all the cute little squirrels, Flo?
21368	Janitor	Let's call this meeting to order. Uh, first things first, I counted the ballots, and, uh, someone voted twice. Interesting. I'm not pointing fingers Troy.
21369	Janitor	There were never any squirrels.
21370	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21371	Elliot	Turk. Got this patient who's got a damaged heart valve and needs a replacement.
21372	Turk	Is he a good candidate for surgery?
21373	Elliot	Definitely. Thirty-five, married, good job, cute little boy, great dog.... Can't remember what kind they said long-time recovering heroin addict a bulldog! That's what it was! Named Paris after the city, not the slutty socialite tramp.
21374	Turk	He's a heroin addict?
21375	Elliot	Yeah, but he is, like, super serious about his sobriety. I mean, he's been to rehab like six times.
21376	Turk	Sounds like he needs to dial it up to super-duper serious, huh!
21377	Elliot	I'll tell him!
21378	Turk	Look, Elliot, you know the chief of surgery isn't gonna accept the surgical risk of a valve replacement on someone who's just gonna destroy it with drugs.
21379	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21380	Turk	Want some of my pancakes?
21381	J.D.	Uh, devil cakes? No thank you!
21382	Turk	Hell yeah, I have. Remember my first year? Mr. Quinn? I forgot to write the order for his albumin drip and he...hemorrhaged and died.
21383	J.D.'s Narration	And it turned out Turk wasn't the only one.
21384	Elliot	Mmm, Mrs. Kahn, my second year.
21385	Doug	Uh, Mrs. Studebaker, forty minutes into my first day.
21386	Dr. Kelso	I've been a doctor for thirty years. What do you think?
21387	Doug	On my third day, there was Mr. Kirshnar.
21388	Todd	Jenny Roth, about eight weeks ago. It was really tough, because she was hot.
21389	Doug	And then later that third day
21390	Doug	Oh, boy, that can't be good.
21391	Dr. Cox	No, Newbie, I have not killed. But I happen to be, as always, the exception that proves the rule. So, right about now, you gotta be asking yourself, do you think you're that good?
21392	J.D.	Oh my God. I'm gonna kill someone.
21393	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21394	Elliot	Anyway, because of the heroin use, surgery doesn't want to give Mr. Phillips a heart valve. So now an ethics committee is gonna decide if he gets the operation or not. And I'm freakin' out, because I've gotta go and argue his case at
21395	Elliot	Oh my God! Is it already two o'clock!?
21396	Molly	Oh, relax, that's Greenland time. This way I remember to call my mom on her vacation before she goes on the boat.
21397	Elliot	"The boat"?
21398	Molly	Yeah, she's been sleeping with a commercial salmon fisherman.
21399	Elliot	How fun for her!
21400	Molly	Look, I've dealt with a lot of ethics committees, and you're gonna be great. I mean the key is just be confident.
21401	Elliot	Well, I'm not.
21402	Molly	I tell you what: I'll go with you for moral support. And, you know, if things get dicey 'cause it's just a bunch of stuffed shirts, then we could make out and they'll give you whatever you want.
21403	Todd	What? I thought I heard something.
21404	Elliot	Goodbye, Todd.
21405	Todd	Back to the transplant.
21406	Elliot	So, who's even on an ethics committee?
21407	Molly	Well, obviously higher ups. Umm...
21408	Molly	...the Chief of Medicine.... A sharp legal mind.... And an older doctor with a wealth of experience.
21409	Dr. Kelso	If Edwards is dead, I want his cupcake.
21410	Ted the Lawyer	Not yet.
21411	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21412	J.D.'s Narration	As I was contemplating how easy it would be to make my first fatal mistake, I had a feeling that Mr. Daniels felt good about this procedure.
21413	Mr. Daniels	You know, I feel good about this procedure.
21414	J.D.'s Narration	See?
21415	J.D.	This procedure's too risky right now, Mr. Daniels, I think we should wait.
21416	J.D.'s Narration	And, of course, the classic, "No matter how clean the janitor gets your husband's dead dog, you still need to put him in the trunk and not accidentally leave him on the roof when you drive off."
21417	J.D.'s Narration	And finally, the lesser-known, "You can accomplish anything with a friend by your side."
21418	Elliot	I understand that because of his drug problem, some of you don't think that Mr. Phillips is a good candidate for surgery, but believe me, he understands that this heart valve is a responsibility. Those of you who have met him, like Ted, can attest to this.
21419	Dr. Kelso	This is a very dicey case. Ted, what do you think?
21420	Ted the Lawyer	She knows my name! Whatever she wants!
21421	Dr. Kelso	Very ethical. Why don't I open the floor to those people who currently do not have erections? Dr. Clock. Do you think this guy'll stay clean?
21422	Molly	Oh, I'm just here as a friend. I-I think you should ask Ted again.
21423	Ted the Lawyer	Oh, good God, she knows it too! Am I awake?
21424	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Clock. Edwards, here, is at best just a few minutes away from walking towards the light, so what's say you stop wasting our time and give me your professional opinion.
21425	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, sometimes friends will surprise you.
21426	Molly	Mr. Phillips' numerous relapses paint the picture of someone who has not overcome his addictions, sooo, no, I don't think he will.
21427	Elliot	Karaoke's so off!
21428	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21429	Molly	Look, I know you're mad.
21430	Elliot	Why? Because you betrayed me? Betrayer.
21431	Molly	Look, I'm sorry, but when they asked me for my professional opinion, I had to give it.
21432	Elliot	Oh, I don't know, if you were a real friend you could have lied, kept your mouth shut, made out with me any of the stuff that we talked about!
21433	Todd	Did I just hear?
21434	Molly	Todd!
21435	Molly	Look, I really want to work this out, but I have to see this schizophrenic patient, and it's already six.
21436	Elliot	No, Molly, it's three! You're still on stupid Greenland time!
21437	Molly	Oh, shoot, I forgot to call my mom in Yergi.

21439	J.D.'s Narration	I know I bailed on Mr. Daniels, but the whole having not killed thing got in my head. Still, no one will notice.
21440	Dr. Cox	Ah! Kiki Dee! I heard Mr. Daniels isn't getting his periocardiocentesis. Since when?
21441	J.D.'s Thoughts	Now you're gonna lie here. Don't be too specific!
21442	J.D.	Since 1:42 yesterday afternoon. His wife did not want him to do it. She's beautiful, by the way one green eye, one blue. She's from Luxembourg. They're both from Luxembourg. I believe they're, uh, Luxem...bourgian.
21443	Dr. Cox	Where in Luxembourg? I-I spent two weeks there.
21444	J.D.'s Thoughts	What are the odds? Just stay vague.
21445	J.D.	Uh, outside Mertert, near the German border.
21446	Dr. Cox	Ah.
21447	J.D.	They say what they miss most are those lazy summer afternoons on the Moselle River.
21448	J.D.'s Thoughts	You are channeling that seventh grade book report!
21449	Dr. Cox	Okay. Okay, then.
21450	J.D.'s Thoughts	Bullet dodged! He totally bought it! Hey, where's he taking me?
21451	Dr. Cox	Mr. Daniels. We have rethought things and decided that you should have that procedure.
21452	Mr. Daniels	Okay.
21453	Dr. Cox	I know that took quite a bit of cajoling, but I think I was able to convince him.
21454	J.D.'s Narration	That's okay. 'Cause I wasn't the only one lying around here.
21455	Turk	Hey. Baby. I'm gonna head home and watch some television with Rowdy.
21456	Carla	Rowdy? NO! Um, you shouldn't go home.
21457	Turk	Why?
21458	Carla	I need you to go somewhere for me.
21459	Turk	Okay.
21460	J.D.	Hey, Turk, can I talk to you for a second?
21461	Turk	Can't talk now, good stuff's happenin'!
21462	J.D.	Can I talk to you for a second?
21463	Guy	Don't care!
21464	Carla	Where, where am I gonna find a dead stuffed yellow lab?
21465	Janitor	I can help.
21466	Carla	No, you have work to do.
21467	Janitor	Let's go.
21468	Carla	NO!!!
21469	Janitor	Okay. I just needed to know where the line was.
21470	Janitor	Helloo. Wrong place, wrong time, little buddy.
21471	Janitor	Fellas, I'd like you all to meet...Kyle. Welcome him, treat him as a brother. You'll enjoy it here. Any complaints, go to Duane. Umm, what've we got on the table. Greg, may I run the meeting? Is that cool? Okay.
21472	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21473	Elliot	Well, I guess I was a little more persuasive than I thought. You got the heart valve!
21474	Mr. Phillips	Oh! That's amazing!
21475	Mr. Phillips	We have to celebrate. How do you celebrate without heroin?
21476	Elliot	Uh, with cake mostly.
21477	Mr. Phillips	Then let's score some cake.
21478	Elliot	And, Mr. Phillips, part of the deal here is that you'll come back for the next six weeks for drug rehab.
21479	Mr. Phillips	Absolutely. Not a problem. I'm real good at rehab!
21480	Mr. Phillips	But after that, I'm gonna move my family down to Florida. Start fresh, you know?
21481	Elliot	Yeah.
21482	Molly	Hey! Did somebody page me? I'm sorry I took so long, I was just eating lunch.
21483	Elliot	Oh, of course you were! It's 8:30 in the morning! Just wanted to let you know that the committee voted in my favor.
21484	Molly	Congratulations!
21485	Elliot	Thank you.
21486	Molly	Well, I was congratulating Dean.
21487	Elliot	Uh, why?
21488	Molly	He got a new heart valve.
21489	Elliot	Oh, right. She voted against you!
21490	Molly	Can I talk to you outside?
21491	Molly	Did you just page me so you could rub my face in this?
21492	Elliot	Yes. Uh, there's also a couple of messages on your home machine.
21493	Molly	Look, Elliot, I hope I'm wrong, and I hope he stays clean. Let's just not make this personal, okay?
21494	Elliot	Said the loser. Who lost.
21495	Molly	Don't push me. 'Cause one of the reasons I became a therapist is I've always been able to zero in on a person's greatest insecurity.
21496	Elliot	Ohhh, I'm real scared, Molly, what'cha gonna
21497	Molly	Eyebrows.
21498	J.D.	"Eyebrows." Like that's gonna make you
21499	J.D.	Elliot, come on, you can't be that insecure.
21500	Elliot	Giant Adam's apple!
21501	J.D.	I have to go.
21502	J.D.'s Narration	Elliot's comment didn't bother me, because I'm proud of the body God gave me.
21503	J.D.'s Narration	Besides, I had bigger problems. I had to do Mr. Daniels' procedure. Luckily I'm a professional, and professionals finish the job.
21504	J.D.	This needle is too sticky! I'm out! Get it together, Laverne!
21505	Dr. Cox	Hey, Peggy? Yes, I noticed the turtleneck choice in August, and can only assume it's got something to do with that grapefruit you store in your trachea. Let me put your mind at ease: You've killed before.
21506	J.D.	Who?
21507	Dr. Cox	Do you remember Mrs. Carter?
21508	J.D.	Whoa. Bye-bye.
21509	Mrs. Carter	Wahoooo!
21510	J.D.	She died?
21511	Dr. Cox	Three days ago of endocarditis. You didn't get blood cultures and you missed it. You happy?
21512	J.D.'s Narration	The weird thing was that I was a little happy.
21513	J.D.	Sticky needle please!
21514	Nurse Roberts	Here you go, Doctor.
21515	Janitor	Psst! Where's your husband?
21516	Carla	He isn't here.
21517	Janitor	Ruff, ruff.
21518	Carla	You found Rowdy!?!
21519	Janitor	Nope. Not Rowdy. This is Steven. You know, Rowdy was 48 inches from snout to tail, Steven's only 46...on a good day.
21520	Carla	I think we're okay!
21521	Janitor	I got him off another taxidermy guy on the internet. Had to trade him my, uh, squirrel army.
21522	Carla	Oh, I'm sorry you had to do that; but thank you!
21523	Janitor	Nah. Everyone thinks squirrel armies are so great...I'm not sure it's the healthiest habit in the world.
21524	Carla	Thank you. Thank
21525	Janitor	He likes the park.
21526	Carla	Let it go. Okay.
21527	Carla	Ew. Smells like Rowdy.
21528	Janitor	He's Steven.
21529	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21530	J.D.'s Narration	Killing Mrs. Carter, though admittedly bad for her, was just the pick-me-up I needed.
21531	Mrs. Carter	I don't know how my car ended up in the community pool.
21532	Nurse Roberts	You musta lost control after you went through the snack bar.
21533	Mrs. Carter	Mmm.
21534	J.D.'s Thoughts	Mrs. Carter?
21535	Dr. Cox	Ooh, did I trick Newbie? I did, didn't I!
21536	J.D.	You know what, I don't appreciate lying.
21537	Dr. Cox	Come on. I know you're scared. A lot of times you feel like a little girl in a big gal's body. But here's the dirty little secret: Fear is good. It keeps you from becoming a crappy doctor. Trick is you just can't let it paralyze you. But don't you worry about a thing, there, Newbie. You're a sure thing to get a kill. In fact, should be any day now!
21538	J.D.'s Narration	One of the hardest things around here is that sometimes you don't get to know how things end.
21539	Molly	What are you doing?
21540	Elliot	Oh, just waiting for Mr. Phillips. He, uh, showed up the first couple of days, but he's missed his last three rehab appointments.
21541	Molly	I'll wait with you.
21542	Elliot	Thanks.
21543	Molly	They look really good.
21544	J.D.'s Narration	...Whether it's wondering if your husband will realize you replaced his dead dog with a shorter replica...
21545	J.D.'s Narration	...Or wondering when and if you're gonna kill that first person.
21546	J.D.	Okay, everybody, watch closely, because if you're not careful, you can cause a pneumothorax.
21547	J.D.'s Narration	Ultimately it'll drive you crazy if you don't have a friend to help you through it.
21548	Molly	You know, he might have gone to Florida early. Maybe he's going to a hospital down there.
21549	Elliot	You think?
21550	Molly	I don't know. Maybe.
21551	Elliot	Okay, there is no way I'm following that guy. I don't even have my cape.
21552	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21553	J.D.'s Narration	Even though I was already an amazing doctor, when I became chief resident I decided to add a little something extra to my repertoire. A "hook," if you will.
21554	J.D.	Mrs. MacCalla, 40s, moderately attractive, condition improving.
21555	Mrs. MacCalla	Did you just say I was moderately attractive?
21556	J.D.	Excuse me, Mrs. MacCalla.
21557	Carla	Where'd you get the idea for the stupid tape recorder?
21558	Turk's Recorder	Dude, I love your new tape recorder.
21559	Carla	You two are idiots!
21560	J.D.	Come on, Carla, I wanted a hook and I only had one other idea.
21561	J.D.	Mr. Hawkins, the results of your tests are back, and you have
21562	Parrot	Liver disease! Liver disease!
21563	J.D.	Sorry, that's all he can say. Anyway, you don't have liver disease you have inoperable lung cancer.
21564	Parrot	Liver disease!
21565	J.D.	If only, Chauncy.
21566	J.D.	Bottom line, that tape recorder won't fly away and break your heart.
21567	Carla	I'm sorry! I'm just a little edgy because my husband woke me up again last night, and he knows once I'm up I can't go back to sleep!
21568	Turk	Baby, I was quiet last night.
21569	Carla	Great. I'm awake.
21570	Turk	Sorry about that, sweetness. Um, since you're up, I was wondering if maybe we could
21571	Carla	Are you crazy? No, Turk. But
21572	J.D.'s Tape Recorder	Gesundheit!
21573	J.D.'s Thoughts	I love my new tape recorder. Not only is it a time-saver, I can record my every thought.
21574	J.D.	I like toast.
21575	J.D.'s Thoughts	They aren't all winners. Still, as long as I have this thing, I don't need to be in my head so much.
21576	Elliot	Excuse me! Heh!
21577	Elliot's Thoughts	Why did I say "excuse me"? He bumped in to me! I have to stop doing that.
21578	Elliot	Excuse me!
21579	Elliot's Thoughts	Frick!
21580	Molly	Hey, I got you a blueberry muffin, but I know you don't like blueberries, so I picked them all out.
21581	Elliot	Oh!
21582	Elliot's Thoughts	A lot of people think Molly's a little off, but I totally get her. She's like the big sister I always wanted. She makes me feel better about myself.
21583	Molly	They're so not finger-toes. I mean, these are finger-toes. Yours are cute like french fries.
21584	Elliot	Really? Yeah!
21585	Elliot's Thoughts	She looks after me.
21586	Elliot	Agh! Sorry! Sorry!
21587	Elliot's Thoughts	She makes me do things I don't normally do.
21588	Elliot's Thoughts	She's the Peppermint Patty to my Marcy you know, minus the thick glasses and the strong lesbian vibe.
21589	J.D.	Half of what rappers say doesn't make any sense. Like that Snoop Dogg-Dr. Dre song? What does "still hittin' them corners and those ho-hos girl" mean?
21590	Turk	Many disadvantaged African-Americans have limited nutritional choices, therefore they must subsist on Ho-Ho snack cakes. It's a black thing, bro.
21591	Molly	Actually, Turk, it's "still hittin' them corners and them 'lo-los' girls." Lo-los, not ho-hos.
21592	Elliot	See, Turk, in the 'hood, a lo-lo is a lowrider, or a car with an adjusted suspension that allows it to bounce up and down.
21593	Elliot	And Dre and Snoop enjoy driving around together in their lowriders around the corners, or lizzle-rizzles.
21594	Elliot	I'm representin' for them gangtas all across the world!
21595	Molly	Still hittin' them corners and them lo-los girls!
21596	Elliot	Still
21597	&	taking my time to perfect the beat, and I still got love for the street!
21598	Carla	Turk! You just got schooled on rap by the two whitest chicks in America!
21599	Turk	None of you can prove it!
21600	J.D.	I got it on tape.
21601	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21602	Elliot's Thoughts	There's Dr. Kelso. Okay, you're chief resident now, so say hi. But don't stop, or you'll have to come up with something else to say, and you know you don't improvise well.
21603	Elliot	Hi, Dr. Kelso!
21604	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Reid.
21605	Elliot	I see you've trimmed your nose hair!
21606	Elliot's Thoughts	Frick on a stick!
21607	Elliot's Thoughts	Molly's nervous because her boyfriend's in town.
21608	Molly	You know, Mike's kind of private, so when we go out to dinner, just pretend I never told you any of that personal stuff.
21609	Elliot	Gotcha.
21610	Elliot's Thoughts	Mike's got a curved peep.
21611	Elliot	Whoa!
21612	Janitor	Whoa, whoa, whoa...whoa, watch your step, there, little lady!
21613	Elliot	Thanks, Janitor!
21614	Elliot's Thoughts	He is so sweet! But why doesn't he just put up a sign that says "wet floor"?
21615	J.D.	Aaaaaaaaaaaaagh!
21616	Janitor	Wet floor.
21617	J.D.	Sorry I'm late! I was recording some thoughts and I slipped and fell.
21618	Dr. Cox	Gimme this!
21619	J.D.'s Tape Recorder	Possible nicknames for Dr. Cox when we become best friends: The Coxinator. Cox of Seagulls. Hooooooog!
21620	Elliot's Thoughts	Here it comes. Another condescending rant about how we suck at our jobs.
21621	Dr. Cox	Since you two have become chief residents, I've noticed that your leadership skills are how can I put this delicately? eh...crap.
21622	J.D.	Oh, sir, I don't know about that. Some people say I'm
21623	Elliot	That is so not nice!
21624	Dr. Cox	Well, then, why don't you go ahead and get that young resident back there to come up here?
21625	J.D.	Easy. Lonnie?
21626	Lonnie	Not right now!
21627	Lonnie	Yessir?
21628	Dr. Cox	Slap yourself very hard in the face, then leave.
21629	Dr. Cox	Anyway, one of you two is going to speak at grand rounds today.
21630	Elliot's Thoughts	And here comes the part where he throws me to the wolves to protect his little protégé.
21631	Dr. Cox	...meenie, miney....aha...moe. Barbie, you're up.
21632	Elliot's Thoughts	Perfect.
21633	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21634	Turk	Our TV's working. Why are you reading?
21635	J.D.	Oh, I'm researching some leadership techniques for my residents.
21636	Turk	Well, you're better off watching good ol' Papa Smurf, here! Yeah, he says leadership boils down to three things: Smurferation, Smurferation, Smurf.
21637	J.D.	"Preparation, Inspiration, and Fear"?
21638	Turk	You know it.
21639	J.D.	Ooh, are we playing pillow feet again?
21640	Turk	I'm not waking Carla tonight.
21641	Carla	Turk.
21642	Turk	I'm sorry, baby.
21643	Carla	Yes!
21644	Carla	That's it. From now on, you and I are going to bed at the same time.
21645	Turk	Okay, that's fine.
21646	Carla	No, Turk! I can't believe that you
21647	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21648	Elliot's Thoughts	Oh, my God. How does she eat like that and stay so thin? If I didn't love her so much, I'd totally spread rumors that she's bulimic.
21649	Molly	So how's it going?
21650	Elliot	I'm freaking out about grand rounds today because Dr. Cox hung me out to dry again.
21651	Molly	You'll be fine. Just do what I do: Fake it till you make it.
21652	Elliot	Like when a guy is really bad in bed and you pretend that he is awesome so he doesn't go to a special store, buy one of those weird pumps, and then accidentally run into your dad?
21653	Molly	Kind of....
21654	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21655	Elliot's Thoughts	Wow!
21656	Molly	'Scuse me. Yeah, those are my boobs.
21657	Dr. Kelso	Ah, yes, medical care for crazy homeless people. Sounds like a money-maker.
21658	Molly	You know it's a good idea!
21659	Elliot's Thoughts	As I watched Molly shielding her boobs and working her magic, I realized she wasn't just my friend she's the mentor I've always been looking for.
21660	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21661	J.D.	Always make sure the I.V...
21662	Turk	Check out my man getting his leadership on!
21663	J.D.	Are there any more questions about evolving treatment therapies?
21664	Turk	Next, inspiration.
21665	J.D.	Now, I just want you to know, you guys all have the potential to be amazing doctors.
21666	Turk	And finally, a dose of fear.
21667	J.D.	M'kay, I'll see you guys.
21668	J.D.	AAAAGGGHHH!!!
21669	Residents	Agh!

21681	Turk	Baby, when you said we'd go to sleep at the same time, I thought you meant you'd stay up until I went to sleep.
21682	Carla	Turk. That's crazy talk!

21687	Elliot	Seventy-nine.
21688	Dr. Cox	Uh-huh. And...how old would you say he was when you started this procedure?
21689	Elliot's Thoughts	The more I thought about how awesome Molly is, the more I got sick of Dr. Cox's crap.
21690	Dr. Cox	Oh my God, I could fly to China, adopt a child, raise her and send her to medical school, and then train her to do this procedure in the time it's taking you to finish.
21691	Elliot's Thoughts	Enough! He's never been there for you! Burn this bridge once and for all!
21692	Dr. Cox	Barbie, honest to God, if you
21693	Elliot	You know what, Dr. Cox? I have so had it with this whole macho alpha-male thing, and I have heard every tired, recycled put-down you have in you. So, from now on, save your stupid lessons for someone who gives a frick, because honestly, I don't even wanna see you or the stupid poodle perm of yours unless it's walking away from me.
21694	Elliot's Thoughts	God, that felt great! Huh. Hopefully it won't have ramifications for anyone else.
21695	J.D.	I'm feeling so good today!
21696	J.D.	I still feel good, 'cause nobody saw me fall!
21697	J.D.	That sound you're hearing is my residents' respect. It feels good.
21698	Dr. Cox	GLORIA! You're supposed to start pre-rounds at 7 o'clock. It's now 7:03.
21699	J.D.	I'm sorry I'm late, but I was singing and I fell. And I know I've used the falling excuse before, but it happened again!
21700	Dr. Cox	Look! I know the only thing you've ever been responsible for was picking which Duran Duran cover band would play at your sorority formal, but you're supposed to be teaching these kids. So how's about you learn how to walk, ditch the tape recorder, and act like you got a pair!
21701	Lonnie	Ha-ha!
21702	J.D.	Kill Lonnie.
21703	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21704	Elliot's Thoughts	I felt great after telling Dr. Cox off. Why? Because I knew I had someone to support me, someone to look up to, someone pretty amazing.
21705	Todd	Wow! That outfit would look better on my floor.
21706	Wonder Molly	Mistake!
21707	Todd	Ohh! No! Not the Lasso of Truth!
21708	Todd	I once had a threesome and not the cool kind!
21709	Wonder Molly	Mmm-hmm.
21710	Molly	Hey! Uh, we gotta do the dinner another night.
21711	Elliot	How come?
21712	Molly	Well, Mike got up early this morning and he wanted to read the paper, and I don't get it, so then he went to the neighbors', and they don't get it either, so he broke into their garage and stole their car and wrapped it around a telephone pole.
21713	Elliot	Oh my God, is he okay?
21714	Mike	I've been better.
21715	Molly	Oh, sorry. Mike, Elliot. Elliot, Mike.
21716	Elliot	Ohh, that's great!
21717	Molly	I'll be right in.
21718	Molly	Elliot, I'm sorry
21719	Elliot	Ah, you don't have to say anything I know all about how it is when you think a guy is great and he ends up being a car thief.
21720	Molly	Well, you know, relationships are never perfect, and...and Mike's got a lot of potential. He's got the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen.
21721	Elliot's Thoughts	Oh my God, my mentor's a crazy person!
21722	Mike	Molly!
21723	Molly	Coming, babe!
21724	Elliot	Yeah! Heh.
21725	Elliot's Thoughts	Watching Molly, I found myself asking the same questions I always do. Did I line up behind the wrong person?
21726	Elliot's Thoughts	Am I too much of a wimp?
21727	Announcer	Oh my God! What a catch!
21728	Elliot's Thoughts	Will people around here ever respect me?
21729	J.D.	Guys? Guys. Guys!
21730	Elliot's Thoughts	Unfortunately I had closed the door on the creep who used to occasionally give me answers. I just had to hope that I hadn't closed it for good.
21731	Elliot	Uh, Dr. Cox, do you have a sec?

21733	Molly	It's gonna be okay, sweetie.
21734	Elliot's Thoughts	As I watched Molly gently stroke the hand of a convicted felon, I had to admit his eyes were stunning. Still, I couldn't help but think what the next few years would be like if she was my mentor.
21735	Molly	The police caught this guy robbing a liquor store. His tox-screen came back positive for methamphetamines and cocaine.
21736	Elliot	Okay, what should I do?
21737	Molly	Oh my God, make out with him immediately! He's such a catch!

21744	J.D.	See, there's no fear! Can you help a brother out?
21745	Turk	Dude, I've got my own problems! I've got a bedtime again! I haven't had a bedtime in like twelve years!
21746	J.D.	You had a bedtime when you were seventeen?
21747	Turk	No! Not every night. On the weekends I didn't have to be in bed by 11, but I had to be in my room.
21748	J.D.	Oh. That's way cooler.
21749	Turk	The point is Carla's setting some kind of record on being a major pain in the ass, and I can't help you.
21750	J.D.'s Tape Recorder	Carla's setting some kind of record on being a major pain the ass, and I can't help you.
21751	Turk	Okay, here's what you do....
21752	Elliot's Thoughts	Okay, you can't bend that way anymore, 'cause when you do, that last vertebrae above your butt sticks out and makes you look like a prehistoric camel.
21753	Carla	What are you thinking?
21754	Elliot	Same ol', same ol'.
21755	Carla	Camel-butt?
21756	Elliot	Yeah....
21757	Molly	Hey, Carla, can you warn everyone that Mike gets a little handsy when he's on the pain-killers?
21758	Carla	Dr. Vaji already told us.
21759	Dr. Vaji	It was horrible.
21760	Elliot	Ohh.
21761	Molly	Um, Elliot, do you wanna grab some lunch?
21762	Elliot	Oh, um, I'm sorry, I can't. I'm, uh, busy.
21763	Molly	Okay.
21764	Elliot's Thoughts	I felt bad, but it was time to start pulling away.

21766	J.D.	Dr. Cox?
21767	Dr. Cox	Hold on.
21768	Dr. Kelso	No.
21769	Dr. Cox	We didn't order any of the pain in the ass.
21770	J.D.	You yelled at me in front of my residents!
21771	Dr. Cox	I didn't yell at ya.
21772	J.D.'s Tape Recorder	So how's about you learn to walk, ditch the tape recorder, and act like you got a pair!
21773	Dr. Kelso	I'll let you two talk.
21774	Dr. Kelso	Oh, and Perry, I would be remiss if I didn't tell you that earlier I wish I'd said, "I must have ordered the pain in the ass, seeing as you're sitting there."
21775	Dr. Cox	Here I was thinking the same thing, Bob. Let's do this again.
21776	Dr. Cox	Tell you what, there, Gidget, if you promise to leave right now, I won't yell at you in front of your peons anymore.
21777	J.D.	You ruined my credibility! Now look me in the eyes and tell me that's not messed up!
21778	Dr. Cox	Fair enough. Later on today when you are with your residents, I'll come up for something, you'll tell me you're too busy in a manly way, and I will contritely turn around and walk out of the room with my tail between my legs. Problem solved.
21779	J.D.	Can you pull off contrite?
21780	Dr. Cox	Can you pull off manly way?
21781	J.D.	Should have seen that coming.

21783	Carla	Oh, hey, Turk, would you pour me a cup of decaf, please? We gotta go to bed early tonight.
21784	Dr. Kelso	I'll have some of that decaf, son!
21785	Turk	Sir, see, this is regular. Yeah, I gotta give Carla the strong stuff just to keep her awake so I can stay up a little later.
21786	Dr. Kelso	Ahh, drugging your own wife. Been there.
21787	Turk	Mm.
21788	Dr. Kelso	Careful, though. Starts out with coffee, next thing you know, you're rooting around the nightstand for an adrenaline shot to counteract a Valium overdose.
21789	Turk	Your coffee, my love.
21790	Carla	Thank you, my husband.

21794	Dr. Cox	Hey, camel-butt!
21795	Dr. Cox	I heard you and Carla talking earlier.
21796	Elliot's Thoughts	Frick on a stick with a brick! Just leave.
21797	Dr. Cox	Oh, whoa, now. What happened to what happened to feisty Barbie, huh? You know, it took me a helluva lot to shake off that tongue-lashing you gave me yesterday.
21798	Elliot	Yeah, well, yesterday I had a mentor, but she turned out to be insane. I mean, how am I supposed to take professional advice from somebody who can't even hold together their personal life?
21799	Dr. Cox	Look, I know you and I have never really connected maybe that's because you're relentlessly annoying, or maybe it's my fault because I can't tolerate relentlessly annoying people I don't know. But answer me one question: Do you think I'm a good teacher?
21800	Elliot	To some people.
21801	Dr. Cox	Fair enough. Why don't we go ahead and take a look at my personal life? I am in love with a woman that I hate, my two-year-old son calls me "Pewwy," and this is something that I've never actually shared with anybody before, but on Saturday nights, I like to throw on a nice dress, go out to dive bars, and insist that everybody call me Mrs. Haberdasher!
21802	Elliot	No, you don't.
21803	Dr. Cox	Well, even if I did, it wouldn't really matter since that has nothing to do with how good of a teacher I am. Stick with me here, Barbie. The point is that if you finally found somebody who makes you believe in yourself as much as you did yesterday, well, I would think twice before I wrote that person off.
21804	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21805	J.D.	Okay, everybody, gather around please?
21806	Dr. Cox	Newbie, I need to talk to you?
21807	J.D.	I'm a little busy right now, Perry!
21808	Dr. Cox	Oh. My fault, I'll come back later.
21809	J.D.	Oh, and another thing.
21810	J.D.	From now on, I'd prefer it if you'd address me as "Dr. Dorian."
21811	Dr. Cox	Are you really doing this?
21812	J.D.	You bet your ass I am.
21813	Dr. Cox	Wrap it up, there, bingo.
21814	J.D.	I simply will not tolerate it, Perry! And neither will my boys!
21815	Dr. Cox	The next minute you find yourself alone, I'm gonna kill ya.
21816	J.D.	It was worth it.
21817	J.D.	Lonnie, slap the face!
21818	J.D.	All of you, slap your faces!
21819	J.D.	Awesome.

21821	Carla	Mm? Wha? Wha? Oooh. It's morning already?
21822	Turk	No. But I could see how you'd think that, being that it's light out and we're in bed.
21823	Carla	Okay.
21824	Turk	Really, that quick?
21825	Carla	I love it when you're all "my woman this, my woman that."
21826	Turk	That's what's up.
21827	Turk	Goodnight.
21828	Carla	Mm-mm.
21829	Turk	Mmm. We're keepin' the lights on?
21830	Carla	Oh, yeah.
21831	Turk	Oh, yeah! Ohh!
21832	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21833	Elliot	Hey, Molly? I was just wondering if I could get your advice on something. You know, if you're not too busy with Mike.
21834	Molly	Oh, actually we decided to take a little break.
21835	Elliot	How long?
21836	Molly	Two-to-five years.
21837	Elliot	Ah! Heh!
21838	Molly	I freaked you out a little bit with him, didn't I?
21839	Elliot	Hm. I try not to judge.
21840	Molly	I know I should know better, I'm a shrink. But show me a guy who wants to get married and has a good job, and it's like snoozeville for me. But if you know a thirty-five-year-old who still lives at home with his mom and he still thinks his band can make it, tell me where to meet him so I can buy him dinner!
21841	Elliot's Thoughts	Listening to Molly made me realize a person doesn't have to be perfect to be exactly what you need.
21842	Elliot	Yeah, I've dated some pretty immature guys, too.
21843	J.D.	Hello, tiny ladies! I don't believe we've met! I'm the world's most giant doctor! Nice to
21844	J.D.'s Narration	As I watched Elliot and Molly walk off, and thought about how Lonnie was a much less stable giant doctor base than Turk, I realized how important it is to have someone close to you that you can count on.
21845	J.D.	Whoooagh! Ow! Lonnie! Damn you!
21846	J.D.'s Narration	Especially if that someone is a resident that can keep Dr. Cox from killing you.
21847	J.D.	Not in front of my boys! This is Lonnie! He's one of my boys!
21848	J.D.	Not sure what that means. See you later.
21849	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes you have to keep people closer than you'd like.
21850	Carla	That was too easy. No way I'm doing that seven nights a week.
21851	J.D.'s Narration	In my case, it was best just to keep my distance.
21852	Dr. Cox	Can I have a word with you?
21853	Dr. Cox	Go.
21854	J.D.'s Thoughts	I wonder if we're going to a happy place?
21855	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
21856	J.D.'s Narration	Working at Sacred Heart, you grow accustomed to a lot of things. Sickness, death Ted's morning self-affirmation ritual.
21857	Ted	People are laughing with you! People are laughing with you. People are laughing... ... with... you.
21858	J.D.'s Narration	One thing Turk couldn't get accustomed to was his wife being friends with a psychiatrist.
21859	Carla	Babe, what do you want for lunch today?
21860	Turk	Baby, please, not in front of her.
21861	Molly	Turk, why are you not comfortable around me?
21862	Turk	You have the ability to get in people's heads. And I don't want you to take this negatively or anything like that, but that makes you a Devil Woman.
21863	Molly	Please, I mean, who could imagine what it's like in your head?
21864	J.D.'s Thoughts	I'll take this one.
21865	Carla	Hey, welcome to Turk's head. You look really hot.
21866	Molly	Wait a second, you're not a lesbian.
21867	Carla	I am in here.
21868	Molly	Yeah, me too.
21869	J.D.	Dammit! Molly, you're a shrink: why is it my daydreams always end right before the sexy part.
21870	Molly	I don't know, maybe we should work on that... together.
21871	J.D.	Dammit!
21872	Turk	Dude! Relax... and enjoy hot chocolate love.
21873	J.D.'s Thoughts	Snap out of it! Abort! ABORT!
21874	J.D.	Stop it! I don't have gay jungle fever!!!
21875	Turk	Okay, we should go.
21876	Carla	Yeah.

21878	J.D.	Hey, uh, Mr. Garcia's family is here.
21879	Dr. Cox	Fantastic.
21880	J.D.'s Narration	Telling a family their loved one has died is never easy. That's why doctors have a variety of techniques for breaking the news. There's the hand on shoulder...
21881	J.D.'s Narration	... there's hand on hand...
21882	J.D.'s Narration	And, of course, the always popular Resident Kabuki Theater.
21883	J.D.	I'm sorry for your loss.

21885	J.D.'s Narration	As for my family, we had our own way of breaking the news.
21886	Dan	Hey, little brother!
21887	J.D.'s Narration	We did it with cake.
21888	J.D.	What happened?
21889	Dan	What, a guy can't take three days off work, travel eight hundred miles on a bus with a double-layer fudge cake just to say "Hey, how're things?"
21890	J.D.	Dan.
21891	Dan	Dad died.
21892	J.D.	There's ice cream in the fridge.

21894	SUBTITLE	10 Days Later.
21895	Turk	You guys are back. Sorry I had to blow out of there after the funeral, but how was the rest of the week?
21896	J.D.	It was all right; we spent most of the time dealing with the headstone problem. See, since Dad was an office supplies salesman, he wanted it to be shaped like a pencil.
21897	Turk	So?
21898	Dan	So, it looked like a giant marble penis which I maintain, Dad would have liked even more.
21899	Turk	How you doing, buddy?
21900	J.D.	I don't know... it hasn't really hit me yet.
21901	Dan	Oh, it will eventually. But don't worry when it does, Big Bro' will be there.
21902	Dan	What? What is it?
21903	J.D.	Dan, I love you, but being there for people isn't really yo' thang.
21904	Dan	No, that was Old Dan. Look at me: this is New Dan! I'm totally here for you.
21905	J.D.	Dan, you've been in here for, like, nine hours: you okay?
21906	Dan	Well, I'd feel a lot better if you could give that ol' "H"-knob there a little twist. Body temp's a bit low.
21907	Dan	Ahh. Now I can feel my tootsies.

21909	Dr. Kelso	So, what do you think of the new convertible, Ted?
21910	Ted	Why don't I have one of these?
21911	Janitor	Well, howdy, Dr. Kelso. Ain't she a beaut'? I rented her so I could repair the air conditioning unit.
21912	Dr. Kelso	Looks expensive, who authorised it?
21913	Janitor	Why, you did, sir. Must have been Tuesday last.
21914	Dr. Kelso	Stop talking like a farmer! I did no such thing. Now I'm not sure how one would go about making a janitor's life even more miserable, but what say we start by docking your pay for the cost of this monstrosity.
21915	Ted	Oh, God! It won't smooth down.

21917	Turk	It's nice to meet you too, Chuck.
21918	Carla	Ohh, he's having one of his 'Love Connection' dreams.

21920	Carla	Mmmhmm.
21921	Turk	I'd love to go out with her again if you'll pay for it.
21922	Carla	Buppy.
21923	Turk	Uh? What?

21925	Turk	why? What did I miss?

21927	Chuck	Bye Carla. I'm sorry I didn't get to meet your husband.
21928	Carla	Oh, I know.
21929	Molly	So, Mr. Woolery: what have you been doing since 'The Love Connection' was cancelled?
21930	Chuck	'Love Connection' was never cancelled, it's just not on TV anymore. I still do the occasional episode in my basement with singles from the neighbourhood. I'm not crazy.
21931	Carla	Noo! Heh.
21932	Turk	Aww, stupid nap! I been a little sleepy these last couple of weeks, I've dropped a few pounds. I don't know, I think I've got the 'flu, baby.
21933	Carla	No!
21934	Turk	Yeah.
21935	Carla	You're not allowed to get sick, you're my "Superman." I mean, if you're in bed, who's going to give me my back rubs, or unscrew the peanut butter jar, or... walk around all day in my new high heels just to stretch them out.
21936	Turk	She's kidding! I've never done that. Not in front of the Devil Woman.
21937	Molly	I got a new pair of pumps.

21943	J.D.	You know, it wasn't exactly easy showering with you in there.
21944	Dan	Well, it wasn't exactly easy for me, either. You have Dad's butt.
21945	J.D.	You think you'll get out of the tub today?
21946	Dan	Yeah, today doesn't look good by the way, could you get me another beer?
21947	J.D.	No, look, I put a six-pack for you in the toilet.
21948	Dan	Ooh.
21949	J.D.	I gotta go to work!

21954	Ted	It still won't smooth down!
21955	Dr. Kelso	He's not a day over fifty-five and he has Alzheimer's. Really makes you think, doesn't it?
21956	Janitor	You're over fifty-five, aren't you, sir?
21957	Dr. Kelso	What's your point?
21958	Janitor	Nothing.
21959	J.D.'s Narration	Even though I deal with death every time I walk into this place, I never dealt with it from this side before. It's full of surprises, whether it's a small gesture from a co-worker...
21960	J.D.'s Narration	... or a big gesture from someone you've never even met before.
21961	Chuck	Walk tall, kiddo.
21962	J.D.'s Narration	... although sometimes, it's a little awkward, even with an old friend.
21963	Elliot	Hey.
21964	J.D.	Hey.
21965	Elliot	I just wanted to...
21966	J.D.	Yeah.
21967	Elliot	Look...
21968	J.D.	Thanks.
21969	Elliot	'Kay.
21970	J.D.	'Kay.
21971	Dr. Cox	Say, Barbie, for a second there, I thought you were being a little bit cold, but then you really saved it with the "... 'Kay."
21972	Elliot	What are you going to do, hide from him all day and then call him "Ginger"?
21973	Dr. Cox	No. It's Monday, which of course means it's Ethnic Day, so I'll be going with Rosalita, and besides, I have a plan.
21974	Elliot	Which is?
21975	Dr. Cox	Yeah, unfortunately, the first part of the plan is not to share it with people who annoy me. Want to hear the second part?
21976	Elliot	Sure.
21977	Dr. Cox	I can't. My hands are tied by the first part.

21979	Carla	Baby, look at you, please, go see our doctor.
21980	Turk	I hate Dr. Kim. He always makes me take my pants off, even that time I went in for Pink eye. I gotta pee.
21981	Carla	Dont' you think it's weird you've already gone seven times today?
21982	Turk	I think it's weird you're counting.
21983	Carla	It's impossible to get a doctor to go see a doctor!
21984	Molly	I'm on it!
21985	Turk	Excuse me: did somebody say they're looking for the baddest detective in town?
21986	Molly	Awesome afro.
21987	Molly	I'm sorry to barge in on you, but I'm a little rusty on the medicine side, and I was wondering if you could help me. See, I have this patient constantly tired, always peeing, losing weight.
21988	Turk	You should have him checked out, he might have diabetes.
21989	Turk	Oh.
21990	Dr. Kim	The good news is that it's Type II diabetes. It's still serious, but it's totally manageable.

21996	J.D.	Okay.
21997	Carla	He bought it.
21998	Dr. Cox	Great. Great, great, great, great. I took all his patients, and I threatened every single one of his residents under the penalty of death not to page him. One last thing to do.
21999	Dan	What is this?
22000	Dr. Cox	That's your basic homemade anti-drowning device, to be worn until your brother returns.

22016	J.D.	I think he'd be glad to hear that.
22017	J.D.'s Narration	Maybe it was because I finally slowed down, maybe it was remembering Dad's passion for bodily functions, I don't know. But at that moment, it all hit me. Unfortunately, I'm not sure Dan's the guy to talk about it with.
22018	Dan	Slow down, little duck. Some ducks can't hold their water. It's okay. I know.
22019	J.D.'s Narration	There's a lot in life that can let you down.
22020	J.D.'s Narration	It can be your mind...

22022	Dr. Kim	Call me if you have any questions.
22023	Patient	I'm here for my ear infection.

22031	J.D.	Really? Not even just like two seconds to talk to me.
22032	Dr. Cox	Look, Newbie. Oh, for God's sake. I'm a little swamped, here. Thank you.
22033	J.D.	You know what sucks? I thought you were actually going to come through for me this time.
22034	Dr. Cox	In a minute! Hey, Newbie? Just in case you didn't actually notice, I have been covering all your patients, answering all your pages, and doing pretty much everything shy of picking up your sundress from the drycleaners.
22035	J.D.	Well, I didn't ask you to do any of that, did I?
22036	Dr. Cox	Outstanding! You're walking away like a pissy little ingrate. I mean, bravo! Bravo, ah!

22044	Dr. Cox	What do you want me to do, anyway?
22045	Elliot	Be more sensitive. Try giving him a hug.
22046	Dr. Cox	Barbie... you've met be before, yes? Now, at most, I can muster one hug a year, and nine months ago I hugged my son, so: you're gonna have to do it.
22047	Elliot	Um, you saw us before, we're still awkward from the break-up.
22048	Dr. Cox	H Hold the phone: are you suggesting that if I sleep with him, that I won't have to deal with problems like this? Because I'm seriously considering taking that hit. I mean, honestly, what is he like in post-game? Is there spooning? Because I don't spoon, I'm not a spooner.

22050	Ted	Well, it took a whole tube of gel, but I finally got my hair down.
22051	Dr. Kelso	No one male or female ever cared, Ted. Where the hell are my reading glasses? I tell you, the last few days I've been getting to feel the ol' noodle is really letting me down.
22052	Dr. Kelso	Well, I'm sure I'm just making mountains out of molehills, don't you think, Ted? Ted!?

22054	Dr. Cox	Hey, Wonder Bra? Do you, uh do you have a second?
22055	J.D.	For what?
22056	Dr. Cox	I'm giving you a hug.
22057	Dr. Cox	Oh. I was wondering what that crane was for. So now, how would you like this whole hug thing to go down? Do you wish to remain seated, would you like to stand? I, of course, don't care, as long as it's under three seconds and I don't feel your breath on my neck.
22058	J.D.	So now you're making fun of me because I need a little help getting through this?
22059	Dr. Cox	No, I'm I'm really trying.
22060	J.D.	You know what, I am sick of getting dumped on, and I am sick of you!
22061	Dr. Cox	Newbie, don't shove me.
22062	J.D.	Oh, really, why not?
22063	Dr. Cox	Because whenever anyone shoves me more than twice, my mind goes blank and all I see is this white-hot flash of fury.
22064	J.D.	When someone shoves you like this?
22065	Elliot	So, how'd it go?
22066	Dr. Cox	Punched him in the face.
22067	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22068	Turk	Do you want me to kick his ass?
22069	J.D.	No need. I already got him back, and then some.

22071	Turk	On the window, huh?
22072	J.D.	Uh, yeah!
22073	Carla	Here we go.
22074	J.D.	Oh, God, who died?
22075	Carla	No, it's for Turk! Get you some milk?
22076	Turk	Yeah!
22077	J.D.	What's the occasion?
22078	Turk	I... have type II diabetes.
22079	J.D.	Really?
22080	Turk	Yeah.
22081	J.D.	That sucks. Carla is aware that if you eat that your foot will fall off, right?
22082	Turk	Well, I haven't told her yet. But I'm pretty sure she knows, 'cause right now she's trying to get me to 'fess up by tempting her Chocolatey Goodness with chocolatey goodness.
22083	Carla	Babe? Do you want some hot fudge sugar sauce?
22084	Turk	Oh, hell yeah!
22085	J.D.	Why haven't you told her?
22086	Turk	I'm not sure. Can I tell you something weird, though?
22087	J.D.	You can tell me anything.
22088	Turk	I feel like your dad dying has stolen my diabetes thunder.
22089	J.D.	Oh my God, just this second I was thinking your diabetes is gonna get in the way of my dad dying. Isn't that funny?
22090	Turk	Cool!
22091	Dan	I smell cake!
22092	Dan	If Uncle Bernie died, someone's gonna have to go on a beer run!

22094	Dr. Kelso	Ahh!
22095	Ted	Thanks again for inviting me to your house for dinner.
22096	Dr. Kelso	I did?
22097	Ted	Yes, sir, you did.
22098	Ted	Aww!

22100	Dr. Cox	Hey! Where's your brother?
22101	Dan	J.D.!!! He's not here.
22102	Dr. Cox	Look, Dan
22103	Dan	Captain Bubblebeard. Avast, matey! Shut yer scupper and bare yer steel, we should be seeing la-AAH
22104	Dr. Cox	There. Now you're Dan again.
22105	Dr. Cox	Let's break down the kid's support system, shall we? He has me, an emotionally-crippled narcissist; and, he's got you, an emotionally-crippled narcissist who's soaking in a tub which by now has to be mostly your own urine.
22106	Dan	I believe the ratio has shifted that way, yes.
22107	Dr. Cox	And I have got to believe that the two of us, together together, Dan we can make it at least half-way to one legitimate adult.
22108	Dan	You're right, Coxy. Dammit, Coxsmith! Crybaby time is over! The kid needs us, and he needs us now, right?
22109	Dr. Cox	Towel.
22110	Dan	Thank you. Let's rock and roll!
22111	Dan	I may have lost some muscle mass in my legs.
22112	Dr. Cox	Fantastic.
22113	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22114	Turk	I want to apologize to you for that whole "Devil Woman" thing. I promise you, I will never call you that again.
22115	Molly	It's okay. I mean, I can understand why you're uncomfortable around me. I sometimes do see everyone as a patient.
22116	Turk	You know, surgeons do that, too.
22117	Turk	C'mon, let's see who's better at it. Hip replacement.
22118	Molly	Alcoholic. That was easy.
22119	Turk	Yeah.
22120	Turk	Quadruple bypass. Two on me!
22121	Molly	Constantly trying to validate herself so she'll sleep with anyone.
22122	Charice	Hey, Turk.
22123	Turk	What's up, Charice. Uh, but that, that was before Carla. So, what about me? Come on, you know you want to.
22124	Molly	Well, Carla calls you her "Superman," and you love that... but diabetes makes you feel vulnerable, and you're afraid if you're open with her about it, you won't be her Superman anymore.
22125	Turk	Yeah. Devil Woman. Sorry.
22126	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22127	J.D.	Oh my God! I'm sorry about the "Wash Me!" thing!
22128	Dr. Cox	Put that on.
22129	J.D.	Dan? You were out with him? I thought you'd dissolved.
22130	Dan	We decided this was the only way to do this without feeling incredibly uncomfortable. Drink.
22131	Dr. Cox	Now talk.
22132	J.D.	What do you want me to talk about? The pros and cons of blitzing a weak-side quarter when you're in third-and-long situations?
22133	J.D.'s Thoughts	Thank you "Football for Dummies."
22134	Dan	I gotta tell you little brother, you were always the apple of Dad's eye... you know, that's the worst thing about college football, the male cheerleaders ooh, God, that's a chick.
22135	Dr. Cox	You know, when my father died, all I could focus on was how he was never there, but you you're lucky, you've got some positive stuff you can dwell on throw the ball, Jackass!
22136	Dan	He is a jackass.
22137	Dr. Cox	I mean, I met your father, I remember it like it was yesterday. After about two seconds I could tell how proud he was of you.
22138	J.D.'s Narration	And then I heard something I thought I'd never hear.
22139	Dr. Cox	Truth be told, there, Newbie: I'm proud of you.
22140	Dan	Me too.
22141	J.D.'s Narration	It's amazing how a few simple words can change everything.
22142	J.D.'s Narration	Whether it's an apology...
22143	Dr. Kelso	I'm sorry I came down so hard on you. I've been a bit forgetful lately, and I suppose it's possible that I could have told you you could rent that crane.
22144	Janitor	Sir? Apology accepted.
22145	Janitor	Whoa, hey! Tommy! What are you doing?
22146	Dr. Kelso	Ah, Tommy's been let go. Have a nice weekend.
22147	Janitor	You too, sir.
22148	J.D.'s Narration	... or an admission.
22149	Turk	Baby, I got diabetes.
22150	Carla	Oh no, Turk, really?
22151	Turk	Carla.
22152	Carla	I call this "Turk's Diabetes Box." Here is a recipe for sugar-free brownies: Mmm-mmm. Okay, here's a buncha articles I downloaded off the int
22153	Turk	Thank you.
22154	Carla	You're welcome.
22155	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, sometimes it's not about the words...
22156	J.D.'s Narration	... it's just about having someone there to listen.
22157	J.D.	And it's our dad, aand he's ranting and raving because he's an office supply salesman and he can't find a paper clip in the entire house.
22158	Dan	Meanwhile, he gets to work the next morning, and he realises he's got a million of 'em in the trunk of his car.
22159	J.D.	The trunk was filled with boxes of 'em!
22160	Dr. Cox	Here's to your dad.
22161	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22162	J.D.	Dammit! Brain Freeze is too hard. I knew I should've gone for Funny Bone.
22163	Turk	Step aside! Ahh!
22164	J.D.'s Narration	One thing I've learned is to never play Operation against a surgeon for money.
22165	Turk	Eight seconds! Is that a new record, baby?
22166	Carla	That depends, what are we talking about?
22167	J.D.	Ah-haa! Ha-haaa! Let's play again.
22168	Turk	No.
22169	J.D.	Oh, come on, if you do, I promise that every time I hit the buzzer I'll act like I'm getting electrocuted, like this:
22170	Turk	That's awesome, but no. My blood sugar's a little low.
22171	Carla	You want a cookie?
22172	J.D.'s Narration	Turk's blood sugar was low because he has Type II diabetes and hasn't figured out his medication yet.
22173	J.D.	Mmmmm, Mulattos.
22174	Carla	They're Milanos, you idiot.
22175	J.D.	I always thought that was a little bigoted for a cookie.
22176	J.D.'s Narration	Cookie racism aside, I had bigger problems. It had been three weeks since our dad died, and my brother Dan was still staying with me.
22177	Dan	Boy, nothing like a little time off to remind you how hard you been working, huh?
22178	J.D.	You bar tend three shifts a week.
22179	Dan	Two. They dropped me one for doinking the Jell-o shot girl. Hey!
22180	Elliot	Hey! Sorry I'm late.
22181	J.D.'s Narration	Since I had dumped Elliot and broke her heart, she couldn't really be there for me. But thankfully she was there for my brother.
22182	Elliot	You doing okay?
22183	Dan	I am now. You know, without Elliot, I never woulda gotten through my dad's death.
22184	J.D.	Our dad's death.
22185	Dan	Right. Air-hockey?
22186	Elliot	Mm.
22187	J.D.'s Narration	Oh, hellooo. Women are checking me out lately. Was it the ten push-ups I've been cranking out every other Sunday? Perhaps. More likely it was the pledge I made not to date anyone until Elliot did. See, since then, the gals have been all over me.
22188	Girl	Can I buy you a drink?
22189	J.D.	I'm sorry, sugar, this store is closed.
22190	J.D.'s Narration	They've been all over me.
22191	J.D.	Very impressive, but I'm sorry.
22192	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22193	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Clock, do you have a minute?
22194	Molly	Sure. I was just talking to Dr. Bromberg about switching shifts so that I can go to Mexico for my mom's wedding. I am so psyched! She is getting married to this guy that has been like a father to me since I was this big. Actually, maybe I was this big.... How tall was I in fourth grade?
22195	Dr. Kelso	It's a mystery! Now, our old hospital psychiatrist used to write my wife, Enid, a prescription for crazy pills. He was a dear, dear friend, but he died or moved or something and now I need you to do the honors.
22196	Molly	Have her come in for a few sessions, I'll gladly prescribe antidepressants.
22197	Dr. Kelso	That's going to be a problem.
22198	Molly	Why?
22199	Dr. Kelso	She doesn't know she's taking them.
22200	J.D.'s Narration	The key to sleeping in the on-call room is to block out the noises around you like snoring, teeth-grinding, or even....
22201	J.D.'s Thoughts	...on-call room nookie. Hello, my old friend, how I've missed you.
22202	J.D.'s Thoughts	Yes, it does.
22203	J.D.'s Thoughts	Time out, male moaning! Party's over!
22204	J.D.	Hey!
22205	J.D.	Woooogh!
22206	Dan	Hey, little brother.
22207	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22208	Turk	You know, on 'The Sopranos,' if a guy caught his brother with his ex-girlfriend, he'd just rub his ass out!
22209	J.D.	Oh, believe you me, the second I get Dan alone, there's gonna be some serious ass-rubbing. I shouldn't smack-talk.
22210	Dan	Hey, mind if I join you guys?
22211	Dr. Cox	I think the question you should be asking is, "Mind if I diddle your ex?"
22212	Dan	Thanks, Coxy!
22213	J.D.'s Narration	I knew it was my turn to let Dan have it, but for some reason I wasn't mad.
22214	J.D.	Listen, Dan
22215	Dan	J.D., let me explain. I came to the hospital to see you, and then I ran into Elliot and it just happened. It was a one-time thing.
22216	J.D.	I'm okay with it.
22217	Dan	Great, 'cause it's been going on for a few weeks. Elliot's amazing! Smart, funny...hhhot. I was in a dark place and she saved me, she really did. Haven't felt this good since my dad died.
22218	J.D.	Our dad.
22219	Dan	Right.
22220	Turk	Hold up! When Carla and I came home yesterday, we heard something. Did you two hook up in J.D.'s room?
22221	Dan	A friend wouldn't ask and a gentleman wouldn't tell.
22222	Turk	Did you?
22223	Dan	Twice! But we didn't go under the sheets out of respect.
22224	J.D.	How thoughtful!
22225	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22226	Dr. Kelso	I'm so sorry you lost your grandmother. Our prayers go out to you and your family.
22227	Woman	Thank you, Doctor. That's very kind.
22228	Dr. Kelso	That'll be seventeen hundred dollars.
22229	Carla	Sir. Sir? It is not your job to collect money from patients!
22230	Dr. Kelso	I know, but I just fired the woman who usually does it.
22231	Carla	You fired Glenda? Why?
22232	Glenda	Oh, how precious! Mind if I hold him?
22233	Father	Go right ahead.
22234	Glenda	Oh. Aww.
22235	Glenda	I FINALLY GOT A BABY!
22236	Dr. Kelso	She was stealing from the hospital.
22237	Dr. Kelso	Oh, Dr. Clock. Uh, look, I'm afraid I wasn't being honest with you before. In my job, it seems like I'm always the bad guy. Hard as this is to admit, it gets to me sometimes. The point is, the antidepressants I asked you to prescribe weren't for my wife, they were for me.
22238	Molly	Oh, I understand. So what dosage are you on?
22239	Enid	Where are my Fig Newtons, Bob?!
22240	Dr. Kelso	I'm getting them, dear!
22241	Dr. Kelso	About half a Newton?
22242	Molly	No dice.
22243	Molly	Hey!
22244	Dr. Cox	Boy, oh boy, does it look like you pissed off the wrong guy there, crunchy. And trust me, he'll make you pay.
22245	Molly	Oh, Dr. Kelso's all bluster. Underneath it all, I bet he's a sweetheart.
22246	Dr. Cox	No, no. Underneath it all, he is pure evil.
22247	Molly	Perry, no one's pure evil! I mean, yeah, some people have a hard outer shell, but inside, everybody has a creamy center.
22248	Dr. Cox	There are plenty of people here on this particular planet who are hard on the outside and hard on the inside.
22249	Molly	So they'd have more of a nougaty center?
22250	Dr. Cox	Lady, people aren't chocolates. D'you know what they are mostly? Bastards. Bastard-coated bastards with bastard filling. But I don't find them half as annoying as I find naive bobble-headed optimists who walk around vomiting sunshine.
22251	Molly	I'm touching your creamy center!
22252	Dr. Cox	Ohh, I am...so very angry...that I'm going to find someone to kill...just to prove her wrong. Uhhh.
22253	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22254	Turk	Why you acting like that whole Dan and Elliot thing doesn't bother you?
22255	J.D.	Because it doesn't.
22256	Turk	Dude, you're missing a great opportunity here, man. If you act like it bothers you, Elliot'll feel guilty and she'll finally forgive you for dumping her. I'm telling you, you gotta use this like I use my diabetes. Watch.
22257	Turk	Honey? My blood sugar's dipping.
22258	Carla	Don't move!
22259	Turk	Thanks, sweetness!
22260	J.D.	Oh my God! This could be my diabetes!
22261	Turk	Exactly. But you gotta use it before that window closes. Lucky for me, my diabetes window stays open 24/7.
22262	J.D.	Unless, God forbid, they find a cure.
22263	Turk	Amen, brother.
22264	Dr. Kelso	Bye, folks. You'll notice I knocked a hundred dollars off the bill because of the, uh, you know, baby-stealing thing.
22265	J.D.'s Narration	Turk was right. Lying to Elliot was the perfect way to get our friendship back to normal.
22266	Dan	Thanks for the loaner scooter, Johnny!
22267	J.D.	I wanna talk to you for a second! Can you turn that thing off?
22268	Dan	Sorry!
22269	Hell's Angel	Sorry!
22270	Tree-Climber	Sorry!
22271	J.D.	Look, when I caught you two yesterday, I didn't know what to say. But now I do. You really hurt me.
22272	Dan	Okie-dokie.
22273	J.D.	GUYS! THERE ARE SICK PEOPLE TRYING TO SLEEP!
22274	Elliot	J.D., are you really this upset?
22275	J.D.	Well how would you feel if I hooked up with one of your siblings?
22276	Elliot	A little confused considering I have four brothers. But not surprised. At you or Barry.
22277	J.D.	Barry?
22278	Elliot	I guess I just didn't think I was doing anything wrong.
22279	J.D.	Well obviously you did, or you woulda told me about it from the beginning.
22280	J.D.'s Thoughts	That one had to sting. I really wanna look back and see if it landed, but I'll have to go back to sad face first.
22281	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, it landed!
22282	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22283	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Clock, may I have a word?
22284	Dr. Cox	Uh-oh, it's payback time.
22285	Dr. Kelso	I got you a present for your trip to Mexico. It's my old Spanish-to-English dictionary. I don't need it anymore I've mastered the language.
22286	Molly	Gracias, Señor.
22287	Dr. Kelso	You're welcome-o!
22288	Molly	You were right payback's a bitch.
22289	Dr. Kelso	Well, just get back to me when you have an answer.
22290	Carla	Baby, check this out.
22291	Turk	Mm?
22292	Carla	Dr. Kelso just offered me Glenda's old job as administrative supervisor.
22293	Turk	Oh, that's great, sweetie.
22294	Carla	The job pays an extra seven thousand dollars a year!
22295	Turk	My baby's an administrative supervisor!
22296	Turk	Let's celebrate! Whatever you want!
22297	Carla	Ohh! Let's go shopping for a new duvet cover!
22298	Turk	Oh, I'd love to! But my diabetes is acting up.
22299	Dr. Cox	Bob. We have a problem.
22300	Dr. Kelso	Not now, Perry, I'm swamped. I'm trying to find an exterminator to kill the bat in my attic.
22301	Dr. Cox	Be a man, Bob! That's what tennis racquets are for!

22303	Dr. Kelso	Oh, good lord! He got Baxter!
22304	Dr. Kelso	Try telling that to my one-eared dog.
22305	Dr. Cox	Bob, do you realize what you did by giving Blondie that book?
22306	Dr. Kelso	With any luck, I kept her from reporting me to the board for trying to con her out of meds.
22307	Dr. Cox	Thanks to your little gesture, she actually believes that the earth is full of people who, deep down, are filled with kindness and caring!
22308	Dr. Kelso	Well that's absurd. People are bastard-coated bastards with bastard filling.
22309	Dr. Cox	Exactly!
22310	Dr. Kelso	Oh, sweet Moses. Everything has gone straight down the crapper since Enid got off the antidepressants.
22311	Dr. Cox	I didn't know Enid suffered from depression.
22312	Dr. Kelso	She doesn't. Those pills kill her sex drive.
22313	Dr. Cox	Oh!
22314	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22315	J.D.	Dude, your idea totally worked!
22316	Turk	Incoming, man.
22317	J.D.	MY OWN BROTHER! WHY!?
22318	Turk	You can stop now, she's gone.
22319	J.D.	No, I think I broke my hand.
22320	J.D.'s Narration	There's nothing more satisfying than having a good plan.
22321	Molly	Goodnight, amigos.
22322	&	'Night.
22323	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes a plan can crystallize in a moment.
22324	Dr. Kelso	What are we gonna do?
22325	Dr. Cox	Let's destroy her.
22326	J.D.'s Narration	And sometimes a plan can fall apart just as quickly.
22327	Turk	Ehhh? So when do you start your new job?
22328	Carla	I turned it down.
22329	Turk	What?
22330	Carla	I know it's a dream job, but with your diabetes I think you need me more.
22331	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, in my plan nobody gets hurt.
22332	Dan	Hey, little brother.
22333	J.D.	AAAAGGGHHH! What are you doing back in the tub!?
22334	Dan	Elliot dumped me.

22337	Dan	She's gone! She's gone! Ohh, why? Ohh, why. Better llllearn how to f-face it. She's gone, she's gone! Ohhhhoh, why! Ohhh, why! What went wrooooong!
22338	J.D.	Don't you think you're overreacting?
22339	Dan	No, J.D., I don't, because Elliot was the best thing that ever happened to me and now she's gone. Ahhhh...she's gone! She's gone. She's...gone! She's gone...she's gone.
22340	J.D.	That's not even the right gibberish!
22341	Dan	You know what, J.D.? Elliot and I were supposed to have a big romantic evening together, and look at all this stuff I bought. Candles. Champagne. A Dido CD. I guess I'll just throw these things out with rest of the garbage.
22342	J.D.	Oh, come on, don't go. We can watch 'Kangaroo Jack' and chug a Foster's every time they say "g'day"!
22343	Dan	G'day, J.D.
22344	J.D.	Dan!
22345	Dan	I said g'day!

22350	Turk	No. Sometimes I wish I'd never gotten this stupid diabetes!
22351	J.D.	Hey! Let's not get crazy!

22353	Dr. Cox	Dear God, she has an actual skip in her step.
22354	Dr. Kelso	Doesn't bother me as much as the whistling. Watch what happens.
22355	Dr. Kelso	Why are you whistling, Ted? Your life is pathetic.
22356	Ted	Right.
22357	Dr. Kelso	Perry, what's our plan of attack?
22358	Dr. Cox	When I crush a person's spirit, I like to use a combination of intimidation and degradation.
22359	Dr. Kelso	I prefer to create an environment in which the subjects end up crushing themselves!
22360	Dr. Cox	Aha.
22361	Janitor	I like to pick one person and torment them relentlessly for no reason. If I could find them I'd show ya.
22362	Janitor	He's near.
22363	Dr. Cox	I'm not sure moon-beam is going to break so easily. I just wish we knew something personal that would really get to her.
22364	Dr. Kelso	Turns out you can't go to your mom's wedding. There's too much shift-switching going on here and I don't like shift-switching. It's too hard to say!
22365	Dr. Cox	Awww. That wasn't very soft and creamy.
22366	Molly	It's okay. He has a hospital to run, I understand.
22367	Dr. Cox	Good God. She can't be stopped.
22368	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22369	Dr. Kelso	Let me get this straight: You want me to offer your wife the same job she's already turned down. Is that about the size of it, Turkleton?
22370	Turk	Actually, sir, my last name isn't Turkleton, it's just Turk. As in Chris Turk.
22371	Dr. Kelso	I prefer Turkleton.
22372	Turk	Sir, I promise you, if you offer her the job again she'll say yes. And I'll do anything I'll pick up extra shifts, I'll volunteer I'll volunteer at the clinic whatever you want!
22373	Dr. Kelso	Ahh! I want you to kill the giant bat that's been living in my attic!
22374	Turk	You keep Enid in the attic?
22375	Dr. Kelso	You make me laugh, Turkleton. 8 o'clock, sharp. And wear goggles.
22376	Turk	Yes!

22378	J.D.'s Narration	I decided the only way Elliot would take Dan back is if she knew the truth that their being together didn't really bother me.
22379	J.D.	Elliot, we need to talk. Nice jammies!
22380	Elliot	Thanks, they're new!
22381	J.D.	This'll only take a second.
22382	J.D.	Look, you know how I told you I was upset about you and Dan? Is that champagne?
22383	Elliot	Yeah. Yeah, I was celebrating my...new jammies.
22384	J.D.	I love champagne. You mind if I have a little? Thank you. A nipper!
22385	J.D.	Ahh! Tingly! It's a tingly drink! Oooooh! Pretty candles! Anyhoo, I know you broke up with Dan because you thought I was upset, but in reality, I...uh...I... "I want to thank you! For giving me the best day of my life..." I love this song, who is it?
22386	Elliot	Dido. And you've really got to meet my brother Barry.
22387	J.D.	Dido?
22388	Dan	Look at all this stuff I bought. Candles. Champagne. A Dido CD.
22389	J.D.	Dan?
22390	Dan	Hey, little brother!
22391	J.D.	AAGGHH!
22392	Dan	Agh!
22393	Dan	Tingles.

22395	Turk	Carla, we have to talk.
22396	Carla	Is it your blood sugar again? I'll get you something!
22397	Turk	Baby, I feel fine. It's just that I kinda been using my diabetes to get you to, you know, hook me up with sandwiches and whatnot.
22398	Carla	I can't believe you!
22399	Ted	Oh, man! I brought that from home!
22400	Turk	Look, baby, before you get freaked out, I fixed it already. Look!
22401	Dr. Kelso	Nurse Turkleton! I wanted to offer you that job once more!
22402	Carla	I don't want it!
22403	Dr. Kelso	Great! See you Saturday, bat-man.
22404	Turk	Baby, what the hell!
22405	Carla	Umm.... Maybe I decided right away that I didn't want that job because I'd miss working with patients but I didn't tell you because you were excited about the money, so I used your diabetes as an excuse. I don't know...I don't really remember.....
22406	Ted	Tastes funny.
22407	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22408	Dr. Cox	You see, Bob, it didn't even faze her.
22409	Dr. Kelso	Patience, Perry. With a tough one like her, you have to wait for it.
22410	Dr. Kelso	Here it comes.
22411	Dr. Kelso	And we've broken her! There sits a dejected a woman, all alone, wounded, vulnerable....
22412	Dr. Cox	Crying.
22413	Dr. Kelso	She's ruining it for me.
22414	Dr. Cox	Lady, stop cryin'!
22415	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Clock, you don't have to miss your wedding. I was lying about shift-switching. I like doing it, I like saying it shift-switching. And I only lied because we were trying to destroy your morale.
22416	Molly	Why would you do that?
22417	Dr. Cox	Well, in our defense, you're overly cheery and we were bored.
22418	Molly	But you thought it would be nice to come clean and make me feel better?
22419	Dr. Kelso	Pretty much.
22420	Dr. Cox	Pretty much, yeah.
22421	Molly	See, I told you there's good in everyone. If you'll excuse me, boys, I've got a plane to catch.
22422	Dr. Cox	Don't even pretend like you knew what we were doing all along.
22423	Molly	Adios, boys.
22424	Dr. Cox	Was she always wearing that big hat?
22425	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22426	J.D.	I can't believe you two never broke up. Dan was in my tub for four hours, drinking beers and singing "She's Gone."
22427	Dan	How do you take a bath?
22428	Dan	Okay, I'm gonna get dressed. Hey, Elliot, do you mind if I borrow one of your socks? I seem to have lost my righty in the fray! Oh! There you are, high-flyer! Hm!
22429	Elliot	J.D., Dan and I both know this is just a fling. Still, I feel like the worst person in the whole world. Please, can you forgive me?
22430	J.D.	Elliot, I came here to tell you I was never actually mad at you.
22431	Elliot	How could you not be mad that I was hooking up with your brother?
22432	J.D.	I don't know. I just...wasn't.
22433	Elliot	I don't know I I just didn't.
22434	J.D.'s Narration	That's when I realized that Elliot and I had absolutely no romantic feeling for each other anymore.
22435	J.D.'s Narration	No matter what the situation.
22436	J.D.'s Narration	It was a little sad, but, who knows? Maybe it meant we could be friends again.
22437	Dan	Hey! I can't find my Dido CD!
22438	J.D.	If my heart could write songs, they'd sound like these.
22439	J.D.'s Narration	I think relationships are inherently fragile. They can be strengthened by a shared excuse.
22440	Carla	Turk! We just got invited to Linda's Jack & Jill bridal shower. Do you mind if I use your diabetes to get out of it?
22441	Turk	Of course not, baby!
22442	Turk	And now....it's bat-killing time!
22443	Turk	Wahow! Good lord!
22444	J.D.'s Narration	Others can be torn apart by the loss of a common enemy.
22445	Dr. Cox	I hate you, Bob.
22446	Dr. Kelso	Same times a thousand, big guy.
22447	Dan	Well, goodnight, little bro.
22448	J.D.	Oh, goodnight, Dan. Sleep tight. There's a bus schedule underneath your pillow.
22449	J.D.'s Narration	And for Elliot and I...turns out all we needed was a little time.
22450	Elliot	'Night, J.D.
22451	J.D.	What was that for?
22452	J.D.'s Narration	The good news was this Elliot and Dan thing meant that I was back on the market!
22453	J.D.	Can I buy you a drink?
22454	Girl	No thanks.
22455	J.D.'s Narration	Yep! I'm back, baby!
22456	J.D.	More nuts, please.

22458	Patient	Doctor's comin'!
22459	J.D.	What the...?
22460	Patient	Frank, you idiot. Your bed's down the hall!
22461	Frank	I know! I love you....
22462	Elliot	Ohh!
22463	J.D.	You ever get the feeling our patients pretend to be sicker when we're around?
22464	Elliot	Oh, yeah. You know Mrs. Wilson back there? She made her spleen pretend to rupture, and then she pretended to die.
22465	Elliot	Got me again, there, Mrs. Wilson!
22466	J.D.	You know, Elliot, since I broke your heart, I've held my tongue every time you've been a wiseacre. But now that you slept with my brother, we're even. So if you bring sarcasm my way, baby, prepare to be stung!
22467	Elliot	J.D.
22468	J.D.	So's your face.
22469	Elliot	That doesn't even make any sense.
22470	J.D.	"So's your face" always makes sense.
22471	Carla	J.D., that's stupid.
22472	J.D.	So's your face! I'm on fire! Helloooo!

22474	Dr. Kelso	Perry, are you familiar with Sacred Heart's community service program?
22475	Dr. Cox	Bobby, lately I've noticed you don't listen to a single word people say, so my reply to your question is I think you're the world's biggest jackass and I look forward to your death.
22476	Dr. Kelso	Well, you must not be familiar with it because you're the only staff member not to have completed his 24-hour mandatory community service. Consider yourself suspended until you do! Oh, and I'm never dying.
22477	Dr. Cox	Oh, guh!
22478	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22479	Molly	Crab claw.
22480	Elliot	Ow!
22481	Molly	Yeah, does it make you mad?
22482	Elliot	I don't know, it was kind of a
22483	Molly	Crab claw!
22484	Elliot	Ow! What are you doing!?
22485	Molly	I'm moving to Milwaukee for a psychiatric fellowship, and by pinching your arm I'm making you angry instead of feeling overwhelmed with sadness that I'm leaving.
22486	Elliot	You're leaving?
22487	Molly	Don't cry, you're gonna make me cry.
22488	Guy	They're here! Ignite the tractor beam!
22489	Molly	I should go, that's my 2 o'clock.
22490	Elliot	Oh....
22491	Turk	Hospital just lost its second-hottest employee.
22492	Carla	Don't think you can drool all over her just because you rank me number one.
22493	Turk	Baby, Nurse Tisdale's number one.
22494	Turk	You g you gotta be single to be on the list.
22495	Elliot	You actually rank the women of this hospital by their appearance?
22496	J.D.	Calm down, Twelve.
22497	Elliot	Yes, top twenty!
22498	J.D.	I don't know, Elliot. Molly and I really aren't that close.
22499	J.D.'s Narration	Okay, a lot happened between that moment and this one. I should explain.
22500	J.D.'s Narration	Elliot did end up throwing Molly a goodbye party.
22501	Molly	This is amazing, Elliot, thank you.
22502	Elliot	I also had a piñata made to look exactly like you, but I don't know what happened to it.
22503	Todd	Whoa, it's gettin' late. Big Dog wants some candy.
22504	Turk	Yes, baby, Molly is attractive. But she doesn't hold a candle to my Puerto Rican princess!
22505	Carla	For the last time, Turk: I'm Dominican.
22506	Girl	My nephew Ryan is so cute. He's six.
22507	J.D.'s Narration	I was content to lay low and flirt in the corner. See, the most important thing about hospital get-togethers is to make sure you don't do anything people will be talking about the next day.
22508	Doug	Wow, look, flaming shots!
22509	Girl	...goes through like the whole day that he's grown up! Oh my God, I love it.
22510	J.D.	Will you excuse me a moment?
22511	J.D.	AAAAGGGGHHHHH! PUT ME OUT! PUT ME OUT!
22512	Doug	All right! Stand back, everyone! I'll handle this!
22513	J.D.	OW! DOUG! WHY!? AAAGGGHHH!
22514	J.D.	AAAGGGHHH! The sinks are broken! The sinks are broken! Hot! Hot! Hot, hot, hot, hot!
22515	J.D.	So your nephew is six, huh? That's a crazy age!
22516	J.D.'s Narration	After the fire marshal closed down the bar, we took the party back to our place.
22517	Todd	Sorry I'm late. Player had a date. Anybody want some chocolate?
22518	J.D.'s Narration	Eventually things wound down. Some people went home....
22519	J.D.'s Narration	Some just went to bed....
22520	Carla	'Night.
22521	J.D.'s Narration	And that's how Molly and I ended up alone on the couch, watching that unbelievably romantic scene from '16 Candles'.
22522	'16 Candles Long Duk Dong	The Donger need food!
22523	J.D.'s Narration	No, not that one! This one.

22527	Turk	Dude, now that I have adjusted your fuel valve, your scooter is going to fly!
22528	J.D.	Speaking of things that are fly, I made out with Molly last night. I know that was kind of a lame segue, but I've been with you all morning and you've yet to use the words "make" or "out."
22529	Molly	I hope it doesn't bother you.
22530	Elliot	Nah. How was it?
22531	Molly	Weird. His tongue was freezing.
22532	J.D.	I gave her the ol' ice tongue. It's easy to do, you just have to be really smooth.
22533	Molly	He kept running to the kitchen to put ice on his tongue.
22534	Elliot	Ugh, I always hated ice tongue. And sometimes his lips seemed so greasy.
22535	J.D.	I'm telling you, Turk. Olive oil.
22536	Turk	Dude, just because it's good on salad doesn't mean it's good on your lips.

22539	Dr. Cox	Now listen, you: Riding in an ambulance takes care of my community service, so I'm doing two shifts back to back I'm gonna knock this whole thing out in a single day. Besides, how bad can it be?
22540	Denise	Howdy, partner! Name's Denise Lemon. Looks like we got ourselves a little ambu-date that's "ambulance" and "date" put together. I got a million of those!
22541	Carla	I am loving this!
22542	Denise	Hey, uh, hon, before you hop in there, could you do me a little favoroony and check the windshield wiper? I think I got something caught up there. Yeah.
22543	Dr. Cox	No problem. I got it.
22544	Denise	I always get the newbies with that one! Got you! You know it!
22545	Dr. Cox	When they strap me in the chair, please let them know the murder was just.

22547	J.D.	Hey, Elliot, I was making out some prescription orders and speaking of making out
22548	Elliot	She already told me, J.D.
22549	J.D.	Oh, damn, I was afraid that was gonna get out. Does anybody else know that I totally made out with Molly? Up here!
22550	Elliot	Now that you made out with my best friend, that makes us not even again. So go get me some cotton balls and a toe separator mama needs a pedicure! Heh.
22551	J.D.	Elliot, once you're even, you can't just go back to being not even. That ain't new, girl!
22552	Elliot	Admit we're not even or I'll make you pay.
22553	J.D.	Heh, yeah, now that we're friends and there's no chance of us ever having sex again, there's really not a whole lot I "need" from you, okay? So g'head and give it your best shot.

22558	Dr. Cox	You're saying you don't.
22559	Denise	Well, Perr, sometimes you do.
22560	Dr. Cox	Can't take my eyes off of him.
22561	Denise	I don't blame you, he's gorgeous! He looks just like his mama! I'm kidding!
22562	Dr. Cox	I like "strangle."
22563	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22564	J.D.	There she is! Thanks, Juan!
22565	Molly	J.D., I have to tell you something.
22566	J.D.	Oh, no, did someone you know die from beer?
22567	Molly	No one can die from beer.
22568	Shinski	Hey, yo, J.D., toss me a beer, man.
22569	J.D.	Comin' at you, Shinski!
22570	J.D.	People can die from beer, Molly. Shinski didn't, but our friendship did.
22571	Molly	J.D., you just don't have that edgy mean streak that I'm attracted to.
22572	J.D.	You were saying?
22573	Turk	Dude, what the hell!?
22574	Turk	Oh, that's what's up. Go about your business!
22575	Molly	Look, I'm sorry, but I'm attracted to damaged, dysfunctional people, and you're just too normal.
22576	J.D.'s Thoughts	Sometimes all it takes is a slammin' hottie to make you dig down deep and discover who you really are.
22577	J.D.	My emotional journey began at five years old when I walked in on my parents having sex in a position my father would later playfully describe as "the jackhammer." I have a mentor that verbally abuses me every chance he gets, and no matter how much I try, I can't stop constantly narrating my own life.
22578	J.D.'s Narration	At that very moment, I feared I had divulged too much.
22579	J.D.	Molly, I'm narcissistic, I'm pessimistic, I'm obsessive, I'm insecure. And I am so afraid of intimacy that every one of my relationships is a journey of self-sabotage that inevitably ends in a black vacuum of shattered expectations and despair.
22580	Molly	Wow.
22581	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22582	Dr. Cox	Boy, I tell you what, there, Jordan, I'm sure glad that shift is
22583	Denise	Perry! I was just telling Jordan here about that sneezing attack that I had this morning. Was it fourteen or fifteen sneezes?
22584	Jordan	Yes, Perry, was it fourteen or fifteen sneezes?
22585	Dr. Cox	What are you doing here, Denise?
22586	Denise	Well, I heard that you were doing back to back shifts, so I pulled a couple of strings so that we could get the old band back together!
22587	Jordan	Perry! You've always wanted to be in a band!
22588	Denise	Get out of town! I just came up with that band thing!
22589	Jordan	Get out of town, Perry!
22590	Dr. Cox	Heh!
22591	Denise	Well, laissez le bon temps roulez. Translation: Let the good times roll. See, that's what they say in New Orleans, The Big Easy. You know, that was my nickname in high school New Orleans. No, I'm just kidding, it was The Big Easy. I was a huge slut! I was, I did everybody.

22593	Molly	Much better without the icy tongue.
22594	J.D.	I'll remember that.
22595	J.D.'s Thoughts	Why would she lie?
22596	J.D.	Should we get out of here?
22597	Molly	D'you think you can handle it?
22598	J.D.	No. But you won't know until after.
22599	Molly	You just need to clear it with one person first.
22600	J.D.	Just tell me who!
22601	Elliot	No.
22602	J.D.	That doesn't even make any sense!

22608	Elliot	It's simple, J.D.: I'll give you the OK if you just admit we're not even.
22609	J.D.	I am sorry, but that is one thing that will never happen.
22610	J.D.	Fine, we're not even.
22611	Elliot	Thank you.
22612	J.D.	But Molly just left, so you have to call her at home!
22613	Elliot	I'm not gonna do that. But, I will write you a note.

Gum's a weird word, isn't it? You know? Do you ever notice some words, you say 'em enough, they don't even sound like words anymore? Gum.... Gum. Gum. Gum! Gum, gum, gum, gum, gum, gum, gum, gum, gum, gum, gum, gum, gum, gum, gummmm. Gum gum gum...
22619	Dr. Cox	Oh, happy day. She's blown a fuse. Mm. I swear to God, Jordan, I can't do it again.
22620	Jordan	Perry, it's just one more shift. Just tune her out and she'll eventually leave you alone.

22649	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22650	Turk	J.D.! We're over here!
22651	J.D.	COMING!
22652	Carla	I don't understand what the big deal is. It's just sex.
22653	Turk	It's not just sex. It's sex with Molly! Any guy would kill to have sex with Molly. Hell, I'd kill to have sex with Molly!
22654	Carla	That's it.
22655	Turk	Sorry, dude. Where were you?
22656	J.D.	I was treed by that coyote!
22657	Turk	You got your phone?
22658	J.D.	He took it.
22659	J.D.	I can't run in this gown, it's too loose!
22660	Turk	I can't run in these jeans, they're too constricting!
22661	Turk	Yeah, this is much better!
22662	J.D.	I agree, but my legs are cramping!
22663	Turk	You spent too much time crouching in that tree, didn't you!
22664	J.D.	I was kneeling on a nest!
22665	Turk	Just think of Molly, man!
22666	Molly	J.D., where are you? J.D.! Hurry!
22667	Turk	Now that's what I'm talkin' about!
22668	Denise	It's okay.
22669	Denise	Hey, Perr. I just saw an adorable interracial gay couple. Aw, just precious.
22670	Dr. Cox	Lookit, enough of the squawk-box, all right? And just keep your eye on the road, whatta you say?
22671	Denise	All right, no more squawk-box. But, Perr, don't sweat the roads. I know 'em like the back of my hand.
22672	Denise	Ohh, Perr...I think I'm hurt. Well, not badly hurt, just a tidbit. Ouch....
22673	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22674	J.D.	Elliot, you gotta help me! We're in front of Molly's apartment, but her name isn't listed anymore.
22675	Elliot	It's either...4G or 5G. J.D., this is ridiculous, it's 4 o'clock in the morning. Even if you catch her, she's leaving for the airport in like ten minutes.
22676	J.D.	That's perfect! That'll leave us five minutes to cuddle!
22677	J.D.	Hi, is Molly here?
22678	Dr. Kelso	It's not my wife, is it, Debbie?
22679	J.D.	Sorry, wrong apartment.
22680	J.D.	Konichiwa.
22681	Turk	Dude, she's outside. She's about to get in the cab!
22682	J.D.	Oh my God. I'll never get down there before she leaves! This is the worst moment of my life.
22683	Turk	Or is it the greatest moment of your life?
22684	J.D.	You're right. Gimme that gown!
22685	Turk	Go get her, buddy!
22686	J.D.'s Thoughts	Hey, this isn't that scary. Uh-oh!
22687	J.D.	Molly!? Heey!
22688	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22689	Dr. Cox	Sorry about your collarbone. Say! I've got a community service form here, would you sign it for me?
22690	Denise	Sure thing, Perr. So, you gonna come by and visit me later?
22691	Dr. Cox	Denise, that's not very likely. And here's why: All you do is talk, talk, talk talk, talk, talk, talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk. And when you're not talking, I'm betting you're thinking about talking. I mean, can I ask you a personal question? Have you ever had a thought that you didn't immediately verbalize?
22692	Denise	Well, I don't know. That's a tough one, Perr.
22693	Dr. Cox	Uh-huh.
22694	Denise	Oh, look, the window's open again! You can see the moon!
22695	Dr. Cox	Oh my God. What happened in your life that made you so needy that you've got to fill every waking second by babbling on?
22696	Denise	Fine, don't visit. My son will come.
22697	Dr. Cox	And now we are right back on your son again. I'll be honest with you, I'm worried that I'm not going to be able to get your voice out of my head. It is a very real concern.
22698	EMT	Hey, did you leave anything in the ambulance?
22699	Dr. Cox	Only my will to live, why?
22700	EMT	Then I guess this is your partner's.
22701	As Perry looks at the card, Denise's words flood back to him	"See, now, I got my son a Ken Griffey Jr. card? Carries it with him wherever he goes. ... He's ten there. He'll always be that age to me. ... I wish I had more time with him, though."
22702	Dr. Cox	What happened to your son, Denise?
22703	Denise	He died in an accident.
22704	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22705	Denise	Thanks a lot.
22706	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22707	J.D.	Molly, I think you should stay. I'm off today, we'll have an amazing time, you can leave tomorrow.
22708	Molly	I'm not sure that's a good idea.
22709	J.D.	Well, maybe this'll change your mind.
22710	Turk	How's it going?
22711	J.D.	Pretty well. Nice landing.
22712	Turk	Thanks.
22713	Molly	J.D., I think this note's for you.
22714	J.D.'s Narration	I think the easiest way to lose something is to want it too badly.
22715	Molly	Take care.
22716	J.D.	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
22717	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, it doesn't help if your friend is a diabolical genius. Still, when you come across a person who's lost something that really matters, you have to answer the call.
22718	Denise	Ooh, he's just such a cutie pie! Look at that! Have you ever had cutie pie, Perry?
22719	Dr. Cox	No, 'course not.
22720	Denise	I like it à la mode.
22721	Dr. Cox	Okay.
22722	Denise	I'm kidding! I know it's not really pie! But I'll tell you, if it was really pie I would eat it up, I'd gobble it, because I love pie! Oh my God! You're my favorite!
22723	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22724	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22725	J.D.	I don't know why, but I feel like Turk and Carla are upset
22726	J.D	May I have a pancake please?
22727	J.D.	Okay, they're mad. I'm pretty sure it's because of my new girlfriend.
22728	J.D.	You know, the funniest thing happened
22729	Neena	I'm eating.
22730	J.D.	Sorry. I'm starvin'. Wish I hadn't left my wallet
22731	J.D.	Also, the sex could be a little impersonal.
22732	J.D.	So that's a no on cuddling?
22733	J.D.	Still, Turk and
22734	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22735	Neena	Morning. I'll see you at the deposition. I'll try not to spank your
22736	J.D.	Bye! FYI, there was no spanking last night, okay?
22737	Carla	Really? Then this won't hurt.
22738	J.D.	Nope.
22739	Turk	Hit him again baby.
22740	J.D.	Why?
22741	J.D.	After spreading half a tube of what I thought was burn
22742	Elliot	What smells like Vagisil?
22743	J.D.	Nothing. How can I help you?
22744	Elliot	Remember how I thought Mr. Peterson's back pain was sacroiliitis and
22745	J.D.	Elliot, you should never use scalding hot coffee for a victory sip.
22746	Elliot	Oh yeah? Well you're ***so something something ***.
22747	J.D.	Over the past few months Eliot's come into her own as a
22748	Kelso	Attention staff: One of our hospital's board
22749	J.D.	Of course around here, everybody's looking to prove
22750	Kelso	Go.
22751	Elliot	So Craig, how's your grandmother doing?
22752	Craig	Oh, she's much better now, thanks. Turns out it was just
22753	Elliot	Thanks! Oh... Hmph.
22754	Carla	J.D., how could you do this to Turk? You two are so close that I
22755	J.D.	Where do we go?
22756	Turk	One time we went to Aspen.
22757	J.D.	Oh, I hope it was summer. I'm not that big a skier.
22758	Carla	Girls! I want an explanation.
22759	J.D.	Fine. Turk, tell her our code.
22760	Turk	If you haven't had sex in six
22761	Carla	Oh please, when you were single, you were never that desperate...
22762	Woman	Oh that was amazing.
22763	Turk	Yes, it was.
22764	Turk	We're all God's children in the dark.
22765	Carla	Christopher Duncan Turk, you tell him how you really feel, just like
22766	Turk	I want you to stop seeing her.
22767	J.D.	Fine. But I'm only ending it because friends come first.
22768	Carla	Plus, you already had sex with her.
22769	J.D.	Four a half times! Lata!
22770	Elliot	Jordan. You're on the board, what is the story on my patient Mr.
22771	Jordan	Well Stick, I'm going to warn you the same way I warn Perry every
22772	Elliot	That's disturbing in like... eight different ways.
22773	Cox	Barbie, the guy's a sexist pig. He's gonna eat you alive.
22774	Elliot	Look, I'm not the same doctor I was four years ago. I'm smarter, I'm
22775	Cox	Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Just skip the rest of your "I'll show you speech"
22776	Neena	So should we start this deposition, or do you boys just want to hand
22777	Mr. Corman	Big bag of money...
22778	Turk	You aren't going to freeze up around her again, are you Ted?
22779	Ted	No chance. I'm drugged up. Plus, if I concentrate, I
22780	Neena	Ted, you ready to get started?
22781	Ted	Whenever you're ready, Neena. First
22782	Turk	We should take a short recess.
22783	Neena	Believe me, you're better off.
22784	Kelso	I agree.
22785	Neena	Now, Mr. Corman is contending that the shoulder surgery he received
22786	Kelso	You're diabetic?
22787	Turk	Yes. I told you that.
22788	Kelso	I thought you were joking.
22789	Turk	How is that funny?
22790	Kelso	Well, it's a very serious disease. And I don't like you.
22791	Turk	How do we even know he plays tennis? Look at him.
22792	Mr. Corman	Wait for the serve.
22793	Kelso	We're settling.
22794	Mr. Corman	Hey, I want you
22795	J.D.	Hey Neena. God help
22796	Neena	No.
22797	J.D.	You can't just say no. No is the answer to a question. And I clearly
22798	Elliot	So how are we feeling Mr. Summers?
22799	Mr. Summers	I feel like my ex-wife is standing on my chest. And not the
22800	Elliot	Fantastic! I'd like to start by
22801	Mr. Summers	Listen, Goldilocks. Unless the next three words out of your
22802	Elliot	Actually sir
22803	Mr. Summers	His name is Elliot Reid. So, what's the word? This guy any
22804	Elliot	Oh, he rocks!
22805	Turk	Baby, you know if my malpractice insurance goes through the roof,
22806	Carla	I live in a tiny apartment with my husband, his best friend, and
22807	Turk	Yeah, I am pretty impressive.
22808	Carla	Yes you are. Now don't you let anything else get into that beautiful
22809	Turk	What could get into this man's head, baby? Huh?
22810	Cox	Tough day, huh? You wanna talk about it?
22811	J.D.	Neena, it's over.
22812	Neena	No it's not. In fact, I find myself oddly turned on by your timid
22813	J.D.	First of all, thank you. Secondly, I tried to be reasonable. Now if
22814	Neena	Yet another strong moment for you?
22815	J.D.	Okay, fine, why don't you just tell me how this ends?
22816	Neena	You won't break up with me, you will betray your friend.
22817	J.D.	What is this, some kind of lawyer mind trick? It's not gonna happen!
22818	Neena	Sit down.
22819	J.D.	I won't, I'm leaving.
22820	Neena	You're going to have sex with me.
22821	J.D.	I'll do nothing of the sort.
22822	Neena	And as the ultimate act of betrayal, you will do it on the very same
22823	J.D.	Oh, I hate a dirty table.
22824	Neena	You love a dirty table.
22825	J.D.	God help me, I do. I do love a dirty table.
22826	Elliot	Okay, Mr. Summers. Your EKGs came back and Dr. Reid liked what he
22827	Mr. Summers	When the hell am I getting out of here?
22828	Elliot	Dr. Reid thought you might ask that and he had an answer for you.
22829	Mr. Summers	Wow, he's old school. Like me.
22830	Elliot	Hey! That belongs to Dr. Reid!
22831	Mr. Summers	So you and Reid...
22832	Elliot	Yes. We're lovers. Red hot lovers.
22833	Mr. Summers	I'm guessing he's married.
22834	Elliot	She doesn't understand him like I do.
22835	Mr. Summers	I love this guy.
22836	Elliot	Not like I do.
22837	Carla	Hey, Turk's kind of in a dark place right now, so stay away from him,
22838	Cox	Of course. But, uh, we kind of crossed paths already.
22839	Cox	Life is pointless Gandhi, and I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.
22840	Carla	And you reminded him that people are basically good.
22841	Cox	People suck. They suck. And make no mistake about it, even sweet little
22842	Cox	We covered people.
22843	Carla	And I know you would never do anything to ruin his innocence.
22844	Cox	You see, there's a compartment in the hat. So the stinkin' rabbit is
22845	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22846	Cox	People pretty much hear what they want to hear, okay?
22847	Carla	What did you do?
22848	Mother	Hey, excuse me. My son is interested in becoming a doctor, and I
22849	Turk	I'd love to! I would love to! Do you have a dog, Bowl Cut? Well, I
22850	Carla	You are so dead.
22851	J.D.	You can only keep the truth hidden for so long.
22852	Mr. Summers	Enough is enough. I want to meet this Dr. Reid!
22853	Elliot	No problem! Frick!
22854	Carla	Turk, wait! Let's sit down and talk about this.
22855	J.D.	And when the truth comes out, it doesn't set you free as
22856	Ted	Did we win?
22857	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22858	J.D.	Wait, hold on Turk! Haven't you ever heard of keeping your enemies
22859	Cox	Hey Gandhi! Gandhi, I think we should talk. What do you say?
22860	J.D.	Sure, Dr. Cox and I were feeling guilty. But if Turk
22861	Carla	May I have a word with you two?
22862	Elliot	Okay, who wants to be me? Craig, you're probably still mad at me.
22863	Todd	Dr. Reid. At your service.
22864	Elliot	Okay, that's a no for Todd. Isn't there anyone here that I can trust
22865	Janitor	Hello. I'm Dr. Reid. Dr. Elliot Reid. I'm a doctor.
22866	Carla	What is the matter with you two? J.D., you said you were going to
22867	J.D.	I know! Believe me, the whole time we were having sex I was thinking
22868	Carla	And you! Why do you want everybody in this hospital to be as
22869	Cox	How could you not get this? What does misery love?
22870	Carla	Alright, look
22871	J.D.	Company! Misery loves company! Misery loves company...
22872	Carla	Oh God...
22873	Cox	Okay, sure sure. Maybe we did screw up, just a pequito, but come on.
22874	Carla	Oh yeah, then who?
22875	Mr. Corman	Hiya fellas!
22876	Janitor	Summers, I think we can save your foot.
22877	Elliot	It's his heart.
22878	Janitor	I know that. We're concerned about your ticker.
22879	Elliot	Ahem!
22880	Janitor	Ah, yes. Yes yes. Well, your paper script looks good. But, I'm
22881	J.D.	My talk with Carla gave me the courage to take a stand.
22882	Neena	If you talk about ending our relationship again, I'll punish you.
22883	J.D.	Punish me? How?
22884	J.D.	You know what, no, this is crazy. I am not going to get your name
22885	J.D.	And that's when I realized I would never be strong enough
22886	Jordan	Someone must have left this here from Halloween.
22887	Elliot	God, Dr. Cox is going to go off on me. It's going to be worse than
22888	Jordan	Don't you mean Playboy?
22889	Elliot	No.
22890	Jordan	So you're saying that your brother's
22891	Elliot	Yes.
22892	Jordan	Has he actually told your family that
22893	Elliot	No.
22894	Jordan	But everyone's positive that he's
22895	Elliot	Yes.
22896	Jordan	Do you think he and another guy have ever
22897	Elliot	No more questions.
22898	Jordan	Elliot, if you can handle that sexist dirtbag in there, you can
22899	Elliot	Why are you being nice to me?
22900	Jordan	Okay, Perry occasionally talks to me at home. And he told me that
22901	Elliot	Really?
22902	J.D.	Jordan? I need you to break up with somebody for me.
22903	Jordan	Really.
22904	Mr. Corman	Hey. There's no pie here. Oh my God! Oh, you two are going to
22905	Carla	Nobody's going to kill you.
22906	Turk	Hi, I'm Dr. Nobody.
22907	Mr. Corman	Oh, I see. This is your Hippocratic Oath? Schoolyard threats?
22908	Carla	Look, Turk. I know you feel like you did right by him, but you have
22909	Mr. Corman	You know what? I don't feel that way. I know you did the best
22910	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22911	Carla	So what you're saying is that even though you think my husband did a
22912	Mr. Corman	I fear I've said too much.
22913	J.D.	Okay, this woman is horrifying, so don't panic.
22914	Jordan	I'll be fine.
22915	J.D.	I was talking to myself.
22916	Neena	Oh, there you are. Go get in the backseat of my car and lie down on
22917	J.D.	Okay.
22918	Jordan	Neena, a word?
22919	J.D.	Oh, it's so on.
22920	Neena	You got something to say? Say it.
22921	J.D.	The thing about strong women... If you call them out,
22922	Cox	I should have known, Barbie. Hell, you have been impersonating a doctor
22923	Elliot	Look, I did what I had to do to treat this guy. And as far as me
22924	Mr. Summers	What?!
22925	Elliot	Oh, and by the way. I had a little chat with your wife. I know I'm
22926	Carla	Here's what's going to happen. You're going to drop this lawsuit
22927	Jordan	You come in here and walk around like you're the queen bee. Guess
22928	J.D.	And just like that we all knew who had won.
22929	Neena	Ouch.
22930	J.D.	Yeah!
22931	Neena	Okay. Fine, it's over.
22932	J.D.	I'm free?
22933	Neena	Hey you. Go get in the back of my car.
22934	Todd	Awesome.
22935	J.D.	Wow. Thanks, Jordan. I'll see you around.
22936	Jordan	Not so fast. You're my bitch now.
22937	J.D.	Jordan's making me stretch out her new jeans.
22938	Cox	Cry me a river. You know what Gandhi's wife made me do this afternoon
22939	Turk	What?
22940	Mr. Corman	Ever since the surgery I've been serving lefty. It's a little
22941	Cox	Can't wait to see it.
22942	Mr. Corman	Hit you on the fly! Fifteen-love!
22943	J.D.	Turk, I'm sorry about Neena.
22944	Turk	It's okay, man. She's a woman. I understand.
22945	J.D.	And the truth was, he did understand. No matter how much
22946	Little Cox	Jordan looks mad, I should go.
22947	Little Turk	I have to pick up Carla's dry-cleaning.
22948	Janitor	Well, what do we have here?
22949	Little J.D.	Oh, no.
22950	Janitor	I

22952	J.D.'s Narration	Life in a hospital is never boring.
22953	Carla	What the hell are you guys doing?
22954	Turk	Practicing our slow motion run.
22955	J.D.	Makes everything seem more dramatic.
22956	Carla	You're doctors. Doctors.
22957	Turk	Baby?
22958	J.D.	Go get her, Turk!
22959	Turk	Waaaaaaiiiiit!
22960	J.D.	Oh, he's slow.
22961	J.D.'s Thoughts	Time to go see my favorite patient, Mr. Gregory Marks. He may need a new kidney, but he sure as hell doesn't need a new heart.
22962	Mr. Marks	Hey, I bought you a present.
22963	J.D.	Oh, my God, a journal!
22964	Mr. Marks	Well, you seem like the kind of sensitive young buck that likes to chronicle his feelings.
22965	J.D.'s Thoughts	I can't wait to chronicle this one! Oh God!
22966	J.D.	I gotta tell you, Mr. Marks even though I know you'd never take it, I'd give you one of my kidneys in a second.
22967	Mr. Marks	Oh, no, I would definitely take it! I would take it with my bare hands.
22968	J.D.	Awesome. Well...let me check your chart and s-see if we're a match!
22969	J.D.'s Thoughts	Please don't be a match! Please don't be a match! Blood type O! Not a match! Yes!! Yes!! Yes!! Yes!!
22970	J.D.	I'm so sorry.
22971	Elliot	Do you have chocolate cake today?
22972	Cafeteria Worker	Nope.
22973	Elliot	Oh. Isn't that just the pickle on the giant crap sandwich that is my day!
22974	Turk	Elliot, relax; I never get chocolate cake.
22975	Elliot	Oh, right, 'cause you're diabetic. Boo-hoo! You know what, Turk, if you want sympathy, get a disease people can see!
22976	Turk	Wow!
22977	Elliot	Oh my God, I am so sorry. I'm just having the worst day.
22978	Turk	It's no biggie. Forgive and forget, right?
22979	Turk	Please get her.
22980	Elliot	I have been kicking ass lately, but this place is such a boys' club I still can't even get x-rays or lab tests back on time.
22981	Carla	Hey, Elliot, if you're desperate to get things done, you could always do what Jordan does.
22982	Jordan	Could you move my car out of the sun? If the seat gets too hot, my thighs get all pink and sweaty.
22983	Jordan	Yeah. Bye-bye, security guard.
22984	Elliot	Hm. Very classy.
22985	Jordan	Don't judge me, stick. You do what you have to do to level the playing field.
22986	Elliot	Well, Carla and I would never behave that way.
22987	Carla	Thank you.
22988	Elliot	How'd you get chocolate cake? He said they didn't have any!
22989	Carla	Oh. I just did like this and said, "Got cake?"
22990	Elliot	This is ridiculous! You can't just get cake by going like this: Mmm?
22991	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
22992	Dr. Cox	Hello, Heather.
22993	J.D.	You will never guess what I found on the computer!
22994	Dr. Cox	Is it a set of adult male shoulders?
22995	J.D.	They had to trim them to get me out of that well.
22996	Dr. Cox	Oh, right.
22997	J.D.	Anyway, know Mr. Marks? He said he doesn't have any family to be a kidney donor? But he's got a son! We gotta find this guy!
22998	Dr. Cox	Look, Newbie, there are times a man wants to keep something to himself. Like, say, he's got a son. Or he's 29-years-old and keeps a journal with a unicorn drawn on the cover?
22999	J.D.	Ah, that's a horse with a sword on his head, and he's there to guard my hopes and dreams.
23000	Dr. Cox	Come on, if the guy didn't tell you about his son, I'm sure he had a pretty good reason. You know, you always do this you get too involved in your patients' lives. And just exactly how does that usually work out for ya?
23001	J.D.	Eventually someone's gonna miss me, Jerry!
23002	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23003	J.D.	Oh, God, no.
23004	J.D.	He made me watch 'Everwood'.
23005	Dr. Cox	Yeah, yeah. Look, Claudia: Just promise me you won't get too involved with your patient. Okay?
23006	J.D.'s Narration	After getting more involved, I found out Mr. Marks's son was an air-traffic controller at a small private airport.
23007	Wings' Joe	Come on, Brian, I don't wanna do this
23008	Wings' Brian	Relax, will you? Relax. We're gonna put her on the speakerphone, if you don't like the sound of her voice, she's history.
23009	Murray	I'll tell you something about 'Wings' they really got it right.
23010	J.D.	Excuse me, are you Murray Marks?
23011	Murray	I'm busy.
23012	J.D.	You don't look busy.
23013	Speaker	Tower, this is flight 117. We've lost an engine.
23014	Murray	Yeah, you're right. I'm not busy.
23015	J.D.	You can take that.
23016	Murray	No, no, no. Let's talk.
23017	Speaker	Oh, God! We've lost the other engine!
23018	J.D.	Take it! TAKE IT!
23019	Murray	Okay. Pull up, 117. Pull up.
23020	Murray	Hello?
23021	Murray	Hello?
23022	Murray	We lost 'em.
23023	J.D.	Shouldn't you call the fire department or something!?!
23024	Murray	Nah, nah. That was just Mickey fooling around.
23025	Mickey	Hey.
23026	Murray	This is a tiny airport, we get like one airplane a day.
23027	Mickey	I'm a pretty airplane! Board me!
23028	Murray	He's a little off.
23029	J.D.	He smells like fuel.
23030	Murray	He's an airplane.
23031	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23032	Murray	I'm not quite sure I'm getting this.
23033	J.D.	Ugh! What's not to get? Look, Dr. Cox told me not to get involved, I defied him, and now, with your help, I'm gonna rub it in his face, okay? Now for the last time, the song goes like this: "You were wrong! I found his son, I found his son, I found his son!"
23034	Murray	Yeah, but okay, but wouldn't it be funnier if I came on the second "I found his son," just to get to it?
23035	J.D.	Yeah, that would be a whole lot funnier. But I have a question: Who's gonna be singing the "I found his son" song? Because it certainly won't be me! Okay?
23036	Murray	Whoa!
23037	J.D.	Dr. Cox...? You were wrong! I found his son, I found his son, I f
23038	Murray	That's meeee!
23039	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23040	Murray	Too early?
23041	J.D.	We rehearsed this!
23042	Murray	We were on your scooter.
23043	J.D.	Gah!
23044	J.D.	Reunion time. This is gonna be great.
23045	Mr. Marks	Mm? Murray?
23046	Murray	Before you say anything, I just want you to know if you need a kidney, you can have mine.
23047	J.D.	See?
23048	Murray	For seventy thousand dollars!
23049	Dr. Cox	I love this moment so much I want to have sex with it.
23050	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23051	Elliot	Franklyn. I was wondering if you could put a rush on Mr. Lowenstein's urinalysis? Because I've got a really important interview for a fellowship next year.
23052	Franklyn	No. We're done talking now.
23053	Carla	Elliot. We can help.
23054	Turk	No! No. You will not turn Elliot into some flirtatious manipulator. I mean, don't get me wrong, outside the hospital, Elliot with her hair up is a slammin' hottie. But in here she's an asexual mess. And that's the natural order of things. And you don't mess with the natural order!
23055	Carla	Elliot, don't listen to him, he doesn't know what he's talking about.
23056	Elliot	Look, I will try anything. I just don't want to compromise who I am. Eh?
23057	Jordan	Sweetie, you won't have to do that! Sure, if it's something really important, you might have to occasionally sleep with someone. That's how I hooked up with Perry needed a pen.
23058	Carla	You won't have to compromise yourself. It's all about subtlety. It's...a lingering smile
23059	Carla	a chuckle at a bad joke
23060	Carla	a look in your eye that says, "If you do what I want maybe something will happen between us, even though you know it never will...."
23061	Elliot	Franklyn, if you analyze this urine sample right now, then maybe I'll have sex with you, but probably not.
23062	Carla	So close.
23063	J.D.	All right, we what's the problem with your dad?
23064	Murray	Well, for starters, he named me "Murray." That's an old man's name!
23065	J.D.	Oh, come on, no it isn't!
23066	Murray	MURRAY!
23067	Murray	Everything my father's ever done was designed to humiliate me.
23068	J.D.	Murray!
23069	Murray	What.
23070	J.D.	No, the youngest Murray!
23071	Old Murray	I'm sixty-eight!
23072	Murray	Thirty-four!
23073	Murray	You don't know what it was like having him as a father. He had me in his shadows my whole life. He actually sang at my senior prom. My date threw her panties on the stage first and last time I saw them, by the way.
23074	J.D.	Oh, come on, you're exaggerating.
23075	Mr. Marks	Heeeey, good lookin'! Whaaaa'cha got cookin'? How's about cookin' something up with me!
23076	Murray	See what I mean?
23077	J.D.	Shhh! I love this song.
23078	Mr. Marks	Ooooh. Thank you!
23079	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23080	Elliot	Okay, so I tried to get some x-rays back from the lab tech by making a kissy face, and he asked me if I had palsy!
23081	Jordan	Elliot, if you want to get ahead, you have to use what God gave ya!
23082	Carla	Or in your case, what Dr. Fineberg gave you.
23083	Jordan	Exactly!
23084	J.D.	I can't keep my kidney guy's son from leaving.
23085	Carla	Elliot will help.
23086	Carla	You can do this!
23087	Elliot	Hi, I'm Elliot.
23088	Murray	Hi, I'm Murray.
23089	Elliot	Hi, I'm Elliot.
23090	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23091	Elliot	Frick! These are my favorite scrubs! Is it a bad stain?
23092	Murray	No. That's a good stain. That's a very good stain. That's my favorite stain ever.
23093	Elliot	I did it!
23094	Jordan	She has nice breasts.
23095	Carla	They're real.
23096	Jordan	Yeah, right.
23097	J.D.	No, they are.
23098	Jordan	They're not.
23099	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23100	Murray	I can't believe you got cake! The guy said they didn't have any.
23101	J.D.	Just do what I told you to do.
23102	Glen	Sweets for the sweet.
23103	Murray	Thank you...Glen.
23104	J.D.	Look, Murray, it doesn't matter that your father's handsome and charismatic and sings like a young Joan Baez. He's your flesh and blood, and you gotta step up.
23105	Murray	Look, you obviously have some issues with your own father that you're projecting on to me. So why don't you go ahead and give him a jingle?
23106	J.D.	He's dead.
23107	Murray	Good stuff!
23108	J.D.	No, I'm serious.
23109	Murray	Classic!
23110	J.D.	He had like a massive heart attack.
23111	Murray	I'm sorry for your loss.
23112	J.D.	Now, about the kidney....
23113	Murray	I wish I could fly my plane right now. I always like to fly it when I have to make a big decision.
23114	J.D.'s Thoughts	Make the "flesh and blood" argument again but in a different way.
23115	J.D.	Blood and flesh, Murray.
23116	Murray	I'll do it!
23117	J.D.'s Thoughts	Jackpot!
23118	Murray	Yawning, Glen!
23119	J.D.	One for the road, Glen?
23120	J.D.	Thanks! Happy weekend!

23122	Turk	Elliot, did you talk Franklyn into doing your patient's urinalysis before mine?
23123	Elliot	No, I just told him I lost my voice and had to whisper in his ear......like this.
23124	Turk	Careful, Elliot.
23125	Elliot	Oh, come on, what harm could come from a little flirting?
23126	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23127	Janitor	Ah! I wanna see that engagement ring.
23128	Jeweler	That costs ten thousand dollars.
23129	Janitor	I got twelve bucks.
23130	Carla	You okay?
23131	Turk	Yeah, why?
23132	Carla	So she used her femininity! The only reason you usually get your lab-work back so fast is because you always pick Franklyn to play basketball, even though he always shoots his foul shots granny-style.
23133	Turk	This is different.
23134	Guy	Excuse me.
23135	Turk	This is gonna cause problems.
23136	Elliot	Oh, I'll just be a sec.
23137	Dave	It's on me.
23138	Guy	I'd like an orange soda too.
23139	Dave	Oh, I'm sorry, that was the last one. How sad.
23140	Guy	That's the way female doctors around here behave, I hope the young lady I'm interviewing is a different breed. Do either of you know where I can find Dr. Elliot Reid?
23141	J.D.'s Narration	"I told you so" moments are rare. So when they come, you have to savor them.
23142	Dr. Cox	Hey, Newbie! The good news is that Murray and his dad are a match, kidney-wise. The better news is that the test revealed a little secret you're gonna wanna share with your new pal. Gregory is not Murray's biological father!
23143	J.D.	Oh, no.
23144	Dr. Cox	By the by? This moment is so great, I'd cheat on that other moment from before, marry this one and raise a family of tiny little moments.
23145	J.D.	Dammit!
23146	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23147	J.D.'s Narration	I couldn't decide whether I should tell Murray his dad wasn't his dad. Luckily hospitals are full of supportive colleagues eager to help.
23148	Dr. Kelso	Go tell that little bastard this second, before he coughs a kidney up to his fake father and sues this hospital!
23149	J.D.	Uh, actually, sir, it's a horse with a sword on his head.
23150	Unicorn	You know I'm a unicorn. Why can't you just say it?
23151	Dr. Kelso	What are you going to do, son?
23152	J.D.	Well, Dr. Kels Well, Dr. Kelso, I'm just gonna tell him. Murray's got a good heart, and he'll do the right thing.
23153	Murray	I'm outta here!
23154	J.D.	Murray!
23155	Old Murray	Whaaat?
23156	J.D.	Not you, Old Murray!
23157	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23158	Carla	Okay! I put interview guy in the lounge and told him that Elliot was with a patient. Now. How we gonna fix this thing?
23159	Janitor	You're okay.
23160	Carla	Okay, here's the plan: Jordan and I will take care of interview guy. Soft-Scrub, you can do whatever the hell you want.
23161	Janitor	I will.
23162	Janitor	Dammit! I told you to sparkle!
23163	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23164	J.D.	He says he clears his head by flying his plane. But I went to his airport? He doesn't have a plane there! What should I do?
23165	Dr. Cox	Who gave you this number?
23166	J.D.	Come on, I'm really asking for your help here.
23167	Dr. Cox	Yeah, but, it's very important we focus on the whole "who gave you this number" issue.
23168	J.D.	Fine! Maybe I got too involved like you said. But would it kill you for once to acknowledge that my heart is in the right place instead of spending all your time berating me?
23169	Dr. Cox	You got the number from Jordan, didn't you. She hates me.
23170	J.D.	You've been great as usual.
23171	J.D.	There you are! Hi, buddy!
23172	Murray	Hey...!
23173	Murray	Ohh, ohh! I'm a doctor! I'm a doctor! Everything can't get to me!

23176	Carla	Elliot, your interviewer called, he's running late. Would you take Turk somewhere for me?
23177	Elliot	Where?
23178	Jordan	Oh. The, uh, honey festival!
23179	Elliot	Oh my God! Is that back in town?
23180	Carla	Sure is! And Turk would love to go with you.
23181	Elliot	You would?
23182	Turk	Yes. I love large groups of white people eating pollen.
23183	Emcee	On behalf of the honey festival, I would like to thank our two volunteers: Our taster, Elliot...
23184	Emcee	And of course, Christopher, the human honeycomb.
23185	Turk	I thought you meant the cereal! Ow. Ow!

23187	J.D.	Can I talk to you for a second?
23188	Speaker	Tower, are you there? I lost an engine!
23189	J.D.	I'm not falling for that crap again!
23190	Murray	This is real! Mickey's not here.
23191	Speaker	Oh, God! I lost another engine!
23192	Murray	Calm down, Frank. You left your engines in the storage shed.
23193	Speaker	Oh, there they are! Thanks, Murray.
23194	Murray	It's what I do.
23195	J.D.	Anyhoo, what do you think your dad is doing right now?
23196	Murray	He's not my dad, he's my fake dad. Which means what my fake cousin Samantha and I almost did in the tenth grade would have been beautiful...and right.
23197	J.D.	Been there with my gram-gram....
23198	Murray	Probably playing his stupid guitar.
23199	Mr. Marks	Ah, so maybe I wasn't the perfect dad. I mean, there were the occasional missed baseball games.... And the taking of his college sweetheart to the Bahamas for two weeks without telling him.... But I still don't see why he resents me this much.
23200	Dr. Cox	Boy, tell me about it. You know, I got this kid who constantly ignores my advice, and then flashes me the sad doe eyes every time I call him a girl's name or scream in his face.
23201	Mr. Marks	Do you wanna sing about him?
23202	Dr. Cox	No. Not ever.
23203	J.D.	Sometimes Dr. Cox is all over me, like every second of my life.
23204	Murray	Why do you keep talking about your boss like he's your father?
23205	J.D.	Remember? Recently deceased dad?
23206	Murray	Massive heart attack!
23207	J.D.	Yes! I mean, yes.
23208	Dr. Cox	You do know he's not yours, don'cha.
23209	Mr. Marks	I figured it out.
23210	Dr. Cox	'Course.
23211	Mr. Marks	But his real dad was such a jerk we just decided not to tell him.
23212	Dr. Cox	Yeah.

23214	Carla	Elliot! What are you doing here?
23215	Elliot	My interviewer called my cell phone. He has been waiting to talk to me!
23216	Jordan	What the hell?
23217	Turk	Woman, I was covered in bees!
23218	Carla	Elliot, wait!
23219	Elliot	Oh. Um...well, then I will just explain it to him. It'll be fine.
23220	Elliot	Wait! Sir, just hear me out! It UGH!
23221	Turk	Ladies. I think we've learned our lesson.
23222	Jordan	That is not helpful, Turkleton!
23223	Turk	I was covered in bees!
23224	Carla	Oh my God, he's actually giving him an orange soda.
23225	Elliot	What happened?
23226	Janitor	He's gonna reconsider you.
23227	Elliot	How'd you do that?
23228	Janitor	Hey, buddy. I need you to reconsider Blonde Doctor. And I'm gonna tell you why. See, I'm the future Mr. Blonde Doctor? And I kinda need this to happen so that I can, uh hey, over here I need this to happen so that I can just hang out around the house and, you know, bake bread or...gab across the fence with neighbor Marge. Nice lady. Polish, I think. Doesn't matter, I'm not prejudice.
23229	Interviewer	What the hell are you talking about?
23230	Janitor	Here's the thing: I need you to take this can of orange soda, turn, smile, and give Blonde Doctor a big thumb's up! Or, I'm gonna take the same orange soda, follow you down to the parking lot, and smash your head in with it.
23231	Janitor	We...talked about your future.
23232	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23233	Murray	I don't know if I can go through with this. I wish there was something to help me get through the door.
23234	Dr. Cox	Hey, jerk-hole.
23235	& Murray	Yeah?
23236	Dr. Cox	No, new jerk-hole! Now, no matter what you think of that guy in there, he always knew he wasn't your father but he stayed in the game anyway. So how's about you get your selfish ass in there.
23237	Murray	Okay.
23238	Murray	Hey.
23239	Mr. Marks	Hey.
23240	Murray	So, I got this extra kidney I'm not using.
23241	Mr. Marks	Are you sure?
23242	Murray	Yeah.
23243	Mr. Marks	You know I love you, right?
23244	Murray	Yeah, I know you do. I love you too, dad.
23245	Mr. Marks	Child arrived just the other day
23246	Murray	Dad.
23247	Mr. Marks	came into the world in the usual way.
23248	Murray	Dad. Dad!
23249	J.D.'s Narration	In a hospital, it's easy to take things too far. Still, sometimes you have to go too far to see where the line is.
23250	Elliot	Please, Franklyn?
23251	Franklyn	Oh, okay. Come with me, little friend.
23252	Elliot	Huh!
23253	J.D.'s Narration	As for me...
23254	Mr. Marks	Hey, good lookin'! Whaa'cha got cookin'...
23255	J.D.'s Narration	...Maybe I got too involved with Murray and his fake real dad. But as I watched Gregory serenade a clearly uncomfortable Murray, I realized something.
23256	Mr. Marks	Heeey, sweet baby! Dooon'cha think maybe...
23257	J.D.'s Narration	If Murray could look past his dad's imperfections and appreciate all the time he'd given him, maybe I owe Dr. Cox a thank-you for the same thing.
23258	J.D.	Hey. I just wanted to take a second to thank you for constantly berating me, doubting my abilities, and the overall devastation of my self-esteem.
23259	Dr. Cox	My pleasure.
23260	J.D.'s Thoughts	Now wrap it all up with a slow motion hand wave.
23261	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, I'm slooooow, baby.
23262	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23263	J.D.	All the way from the parking lot! I told you I could do it! Who's the idiot now!
23264	J.D.'s Thoughts	Despite my burning thighs, giving Turk that piggyback ride was worth it. Because I'm sure it put him in a great mood.
23265	Turk	I'm in the worst mood.
23266	J.D.'s Thoughts	Why did I do it!?
23267	Turk	Kelso's got this new stupid outreach program where families are allowed to observe surgeries. Yesterday I had to do a bypass on this guy. You should have seen the family, standing there motionless, silently judging me.
23268	Turk	And today I gotta do a colectomy on that guy. What do you think his family is gonna be like?
23269	Woman	There's a tumor in there! There's a tumor in there!
23270	Guy	Ohh, don't go behind the kidney, brotha!
23271	J.D.	Shhhh!
23272	Turk	You didn't go to the black family yelling at the movie screen stereotype, did you?
23273	J.D.	Like a bear to honey.
23274	Turk	Oh, don't worry. I gotcha.
23275	J.D.	Buckle up, buddy!
23276	Turk	Hell yeah!
23277	J.D.	Hey, kids, I'm Dr. Dorian. I'm sure you have lots of questions, so let's get started.
23278	J.D.	So, basically it's a topical application consisting of equal parts triethanolamine and phenyl dimethicone. I suggest applying it twice a day for extra hold. Okay? Here's a sample tube, Reuben. Excellent query.
23279	J.D.	Okay, then, anybody else?
23280	Reuben	What was your best moment in medicine?
23281	J.D.	I-I'd say my best moment was probably my second year, New Year's Eve. A young pregnant woman could barely make it into the hospital, she had her baby right there on the ramp.
23282	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23283	Blonde	You know, that's my first grandchild. Did you deliver?
23284	J.D.	No, I didn't. But I did watch. And I am a doctor. And you look amazing.
23285	J.D.	So even though Dr. Mickhead actually delivered the kid, yours truly rang in the new year with grandma!
23286	J.D.	We had sex.
23287	J.D.	That's how I do it.
23288	Elliot	That was your best moment?
23289	Turk	I totally get it. Older ladies know how to work it!
23290	Carla	Okay, see, now you're in a bit of a pickle because the older lady you're talking about better not be me, and it sure as hell better not be somebody else. So whatta you have to say?
23291	Turk	Your favorite jeans are too tight and they look ridiculous!
23292	Carla	What!?
23293	Turk	Well, I I'm in trouble anyway and it needed to be said!
23294	Carla	Well, unfortunately for you that's just not true! Right?
23295	Turk	Heh!
23296	Carla	Wow.
23297	Todd	I'll tell you what my best moment in medicine was.
23298	Dr. Wen	Dammit, we lost him. Call it.
23299	Todd	I'm not giving up on this guy! Prop his hand up.
23300	Nurse	What?
23301	Todd	I said prop his hand up!
23302	Todd	That's right: The Miracle Five.
23303	Dr. Kelso	You take this one, Perry.
23304	Dr. Cox	Great moment, there, dumb-ass. It starts out with a profound misunderstanding of how the human body works, and winds up with you shattering some old man's hand.
23305	Todd	Oh, yeah.
23306	J.D.	You know what'd be really neat? If you guys all took a second and thought about what your best moment in medicine was.
23307	J.D.	It woulda been neat.

23309	J.D.'s Thoughts	There's nothing sadder than a young guy checking into the hospital during the holidays. I think I'll tell Elliot that.
23310	J.D.	There's nothing sadder than a young guy checking into the hospital on the holidays.
23311	Elliot	Mmm.
23312	Tyler	Hi. That's my dad.
23313	Elliot	Except that.
23314	Elliot	And that.
23315	Mr. Milligan	Just been so tired lately. Yesterday, when the little man and I were wrestling, he he dropped me in ten seconds.
23316	Tyler	I got him with a power kick.
23317	Carla	Hey! You brought Tyler a new ice cream cone!
23318	J.D.	Sure....
23319	Tyler	Thanks.
23320	J.D.	It's a waffle cone.
23321	Mr. Milligan	Don't you get that from kissing?
23322	J.D.	There are other ways you can get it.
23323	J.D.	Dr. Cox.
23324	Dr. Cox	Hold that thought, Newbie. One, two, three, four.

23326	Carla	Five if you count Mrs. Cross.
23327	Carla	The other day, she went off her meds, sa-lammed him with a cafeteria tray!
23328	J.D.	She came out of nowhere!
23329	Mr. Milligan	Am I gonna get out of here in time for Christmas? Tyler's mom isn't around anymore, and I'd really hate to ship him off to his grandparents'.
23330	J.D.	You'll beat Santa home. I promise.
23331	Dr. Cox	Phyllis. Outside.
23332	Dr. Cox	What the hell was that in there?
23333	J.D.	Agh!
23334	J.D.	That's one more point for Mrs. Cross. But let's see how she enjoys her beloved hard candy without ... her choppers!
23335	Dr. Cox	Newbie! You never promise a patient that they're gonna be fine!
23336	J.D.	Mr. Milligan? His blood pressure's a little low; he just has mono.
23337	Dr. Cox	Oh, for God's sakes, Newbie, take a look around, would you please? What's the difference between your Mr. Milligan and every other patient in this I.C.U.? And if the answer to that question is that he's the only one young enough to have never made a phone call like this: "Brring! Hello? Operator? Give me ," then you'd be right. But since I'm not in the mood to make some big, dramatic, sweeping statement, I'll just tell you this: God hates doctors, He truly does. You see all these old people in here? Well, any of 'em would give just about anything to be able to sashay off this planet, but most of 'em are gonna stay and they're gonna live forever and ever and ever. And your Mr. Milligan, well, it turns out he's just young enough to die. I mean, think about it: It's the holidays, there's a sweet little kid involved. Can't you just feel it?
23338	J.D.'s Narration	I did feel it. And I knew what Carla was gonna say before she said it.
23339	Carla	Mr. Milligan is unconscious.
23340	Dr. Cox	Newbie, let's go.

23342	J.D.'s words echo	"Think of your best moment in medicine...."
23343	Patient	You know, thanks for taking care of me, ma'am. If there is ever any way that I can hook you up, you just call me at work.
23344	Elliot	Don't worry about it. So, what do you do?
23345	Patient	Ahh, I raise and breed ponies.
23346	Elliot	Ponies!
23347	Elliot	Come on, Thunder! Can't be late for rounds again, let's go. Giddyup!
23348	Carla	Hey, Elliot? Would you keep an eye on Tyler, here, while we take care of his dad?
23349	Elliot	Hi! Yeah, I'm not that great with kids. They've got such tiny hands. It's creepy.
23350	Carla	I'm leaving now.
23351	Tyler	My dad's in the I.C.U. What does that mean?
23352	Elliot	Well, uh, Tyler, that stands for "Intensive Care Unit." It's where we put our patients who need extra care, like somebody who might need help breathing because their lung collapsed, or maybe they had a brain aneurysm, which is basically when a vessel ruptures and then blood pours into the
23353	Elliot	You know what, forget it. You wanna see someone who's worse off than your dad? We call him The Head in the Bed!
23354	Tyler	Okay.
23355	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23356	Dr. Cox	Well, I'd start him on Dopamine.
23357	J.D.	Already done.
23358	Dr. Cox	Well, I'd scan his head.
23359	J.D.	I already ordered it.
23360	Dr. Cox	Well, I'd definitely give Mrs. Cross her teeth back.
23361	J.D.	That I will not do!
23362	Carla	Hey, J.D. Turns out Mr. Milligan doesn't have insurance. Dr. Kelso said once he's stable we have to bounce him to County.
23363	J.D.	Turk! Hey! If you go talk to Kelso for me, I'll give you this special Christmas gum.
23364	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, this is actually Mrs. Cross's medicated denture gum? So you have to sell it with your eyes. Sell it.... Sell it...!
23365	Turk	Okay.
23366	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23367	J.D.'s words echo	"Think of your best moment in medicine...."
23368	Dr. Kelso	I said, "I can't do it on my own!"
23369	Waiter	Excuse me, sir! A-a man just fainted over there! Are you a doctor?
23370	Dr. Kelso	Not this weekend, son.
23371	Turk	Dr. Kelso, I know you told Carla to bounce Mr. Milligan to County, but it's Christmas! So...what do you say?
23372	Dr. Kelso	I'd say get me a 3T form!
23373	Turk	3T f ? What's that?
23374	Dr. Kelso	That's Tough Titties, Turkleton!
23375	Turk	Oh, God.
23376	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23377	Elliot	So, uh...what do you want to be when you grow up?
23378	Tyler	A baseball player.
23379	Elliot	Yeah, well, I wanted to be a ballerina when I was little. But, according to my mom, six-year-olds with mild scoliosis and giant man-feet aren't dancer material. But the joke's on her, because I am currently waiting to hear if the Saint Martha's Community Theatre will let me work lights for their production of The Nutcracker. Heh.
23380	Tyler	Can I have some chocolate milk?
23381	Elliot	Here's a buck. There's a vending machine right outside that door.
23382	Nurse Roberts	Dr. Reid. Would you sign this for me, please?
23383	Elliot	Sure!
23384	Nurse Roberts	Minding my own business. How 'bout you?
23385	Elliot	Hopefully lighting the crap out of Saint Martha's auditorium!

23391	Dr. Mickhead	Thanks, Carla!
23392	Carla	You're welcome, doctor.
23393	Dr. Cox	Carla? What's goin' on up there?
23394	Carla	I'm sorry, I was just thinking about the last time a doctor actually listened to me. Sometimes I feel like
23395	Dr. Cox	Did you get the results of the scan?
23396	J.D.	They came back negative. I feel like we're missing something in his patient history.
23397	Carla	When he came in, Mr. Milligan said that he and his son had been wrestling and goofing around.
23398	Dr. Cox	Oh my God, he just might have goof-arounditis.
23399	J.D.	We should also check him for the silly-willies.
23400	Carla	It's okay, they're just stressed out.
23401	Janitor	Any time a doctor disrespects me, I respond with a little note.
23402	Janitor	Wah. Worth it!

23404	Dr. Cox	Are you swanning this guy?
23405	J.D.	Look, I really don't need you checking up on me every five seconds, okay? I'm a doctor, and I have as much medical expertise as anyone in this place.
23406	J.D.	Now what exactly is swanning?
23407	Dr. Cox	What?!
23408	J.D.	I'm kidding. Enough of the backseat doctoring I got this.
23409	J.D.'s Narration	Why does it seem like every time I take a stand, everything turns to crap?
23410	Elliot	I gave that kid some money and sent him outside the hospital, and now I can't find him.
23411	J.D.	I'm sorry, what?
23412	Turk	Kelso said, no insurance, you gotta stabilize the guy and then bounce him.
23413	J.D.	You gotta be kidding me.
23414	Dr. Cox	I'll tell you what, in about ten more minutes none of this is gonna matter, because this guy's circling the drain.
23415	J.D.	Why are you sick?
23416	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23417	J.D.'s Thoughts	I can't figure this out. Maybe if we tried stress-dosed steroids?
23418	J.D.	I can't figure this out. Maybe if we tried stress-dosed steroids?
23419	Dr. Cox	Or maybe we could just fill a syringe with false promises and inject him with that. Hm! Says here you already got that one covered!
23420	J.D.	You know, try and discourage me all you want, because kites fly highest against the wind.
23421	Dr. Cox	What?
23422	J.D.	I'm a kite! I'm a big, beautiful kite! Fly!
23423	Carla	Wrestling.
23424	Carla	Remember? He said his kid dropped him with a power kick.
23425	J.D.	Kids can kick pretty hard. Maybe he ruptured his spleen?
23426	Dr. Cox	Get a stat abdominal CT.
23427	Dr. Cox	Great catch there, Carla.

23434	Dr. Wen	Well, it's official. Dr. Turk is now the fastest appendectomy in the hospital.
23435	Turk	In your face, Dr. Beardface!
23436	Dr. Beardface	It's Beardfacé!
23437	J.D.	What the hell are you doing?
23438	Turk	I got gummed.
23439	J.D.	Come on, it turns out Mr. Milligan has a ruptured spleen. We're prepping him for surgery in room C.
23440	Turk	That's the room where the family gets to observe.
23441	J.D.	So?
23442	Turk	So, dude, you don't understand. When I operate, I don't see a person, I see a machine with parts that need to be replaced and circuits that need to be rewired.
23443	J.D.	So you think you're a robot mechanic?
23444	Turk	As a surgeon, the more detached I am, the more focused I am. And it's pretty impossible to feel focused or detached when this guy's family's watching every move I make.
23445	J.D.	Well, I wouldn't worry about that. Mr. Milligan only has a son and Elliot lost him.
23446	Turk	Awesome! For me.

23448	Turk	For me.

23452	Tyler	Well, you know what I think is fun? Baseball.
23453	Dr. Kelso	My son is a big baseball fan. Not so much playing it, but more the designing and sewing of uniforms.
23454	Tyler	That's neat.
23455	Dr. Kelso	No, it's not.
23456	Tyler	Maybe we can play catch sometime.
23457	Dr. Kelso	I hope so, young man.
23458	Elliot	Oh! Thank God, Tyler, there you are!
23459	Dr. Kelso	Mabel, this is Bob Kelso. Uh, what's say we juggle some things and see if we can't free-ride Mr. Milligan financially for a while, okay?

23462	Elliot	Don't run off on me again, Tyler.
23463	Tyler	Sorry. I got scared. And when I get scared I hide. I know it's stupid....
23464	Elliot	It's not stupid! Wanna know where I used to hide when I used to get scared? This closet right here. And the one on the second floor. Oh, and there's also this broken MRI machine down in the basement. It's like my own private cocoon....
23465	Tyler	You really got scared?
23466	Elliot	Yeah. Everybody does here at first. Check this out.
23467	Tyler	Cool.
23468	Elliot	Hang in there, Steve.
23469	Steve	In med school, they never teach you how to deal with death
23470	Elliot	Steve'll be stronger if he gets through this on his own.
23471	Tyler	So, how did you stop being scared?
23472	Elliot	I just realized that people here need me to be brave. Just like your dad needs you to be brave for his operation.
23473	Tyler	Can I hold his hand?
23474	Elliot	They're not actually very big on that.
23475	Tyler	Can I at least watch?
23476	Elliot	Are you sure?
23477	Elliot	Get it together, Steve!
23478	Steve	I'm trying!

23487	Dr. Cox	WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Let's see anybody else make that shot! Huh? Who's your daddy? Who's your daddy! Who's your daddy?
23488	Dr. Cox	Uh, Carla. Carla, have you, uh, have you seen Newbie?
23489	Carla	Oh, he got off your leash?
23490	Dr. Cox	Give me a break.
23491	Dr. Cox	Eh, it's a long story involving my son, a rum cake, and a low counter. Suffice to say that it turns out at first it's it's endearing to watch them bounce off of the walls. But, man, you take your eyes off 'em for one second and BAM! they got a bucket on their head and they're plowing right through your brand new flat screen TV. God save me, it was barely out of the box.
23492	Carla	He figured out that spleen thing, maybe you should get off his case.
23493	Dr. Cox	I would love to get off of his case. In fact, nothing would make me happier than to watch him walk into a patient's room and not feel that I have to run in after him and check up on everything.
23494	Carla	You wanna know what I think?
23495	Dr. Cox	...No.
23496	Carla	I think you know how good a doctor J.D. is, and whether you admit it or not, you have a great personal stake in his future. So don't pretend for one second that all this attention you throw at him is just for him, because it's also for you. As your friend, I'm telling you that if you want him to keep growing you oughtta back off of him once in a while.
23497	Dr. Cox	Carla
23498	Carla	And don't say anything, because you know I'm right and my jeans do look good.

23512	Turk	Yeah, kid, you could stay.
23513	Tyler	Dr. Turk? Thanks.
23514	J.D.'s Narration	None of us wanted to say what we were thinking: How vulnerable we felt. So we all just stood around, pretending to work, and waited for someone to come through that door and tell us how this was gonna end.
23515	Turk	Who's the man!
23516	J.D.	All right, you guys, we still got a lot of work to do. Turk, why don't you go check the post-op films in radiology; and Carla will transfuse back to a hemoglobin ten; and Elliot, why don't you take Tyler and go get us all ice cream immediately.
23517	J.D.	I'm gonna go check on him. You wanna come?
23518	Dr. Cox	No. No, you got it.

23521	J.D.	My best moment...? Well, there was this guy...
23522	Elliot	...he had the most amazing little kid...
23523	Carla	...and the doctors actually listened to me...
23524	Turk	...I knocked the surgery right out the park...
23525	Dr. Kelso	...and I decided to pull some strings for the guy...
23526	Dr. Cox	...and honest to God, I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it myself, but Newbie handled the whole thing wire to wire...
23527	J.D.	...and I kept my promise. Because the two of them got home in time for Christmas. And that was my best moment in medicine.

23535	Elliot	Yes.... For these.
23536	J.D.	You got the tiny post-its! Aww, awesome! For our tiny bulletin board! Aaaand I have a dentist appointment that got moved to Tuesday at 4 PM. "Don't floss before you come in, it makes your gums bloody"! Aww!
23537	J.D.'s Narration	Bottom line together, Elliot and I are the greatest co-chief residents of all time.
23538	Dr. Cox	You two are, without a doubt, the worst co-chief residents of all time. And in case you haven't noticed, we've got ourselves one hospital chock-full of monkey interns; and, news-flash, your job is to catch whatever they're flinging. Coffee talk, ladies, is now officially over. Get your asses to work. Now.
23539	J.D.	Cream?
23540	Elliot	Please!
23541	J.D.'s Narration	Yep, not even Dr. Cox could faze us. Because we had every facet of this job down.
23542	J.D.'s Narration	We figured out a fair way to schedule all the interns' shifts....
23543	J.D.	Okay, whoever gets Dr. Reid's scrub top back to her first doesn't have to work this weekend! Commence the scuffle!
23544	Elliot	I hope it doesn't rain today.
23545	J.D.	Me too.
23546	Female Intern	My eye!
23547	Lonnie	Ow! My lip!
23548	J.D.'s Narration	We knew how to protect the interns from Dr. Kelso.
23549	Dr. Kelso	Look, Brent, is it? Son, please tell me you come with a money back guarantee, because I'd like to get something useful like a can of Brent remover! I mean, for God's sa

23554	J.D.	He's gone. He's gone.
23555	Elliot	Heh, look, Brent, you are doing fine.
23556	J.D.'s Narration	Still, it's not like we didn't keep the interns on their toes.
23557	J.D.	So, Lonnie, get in here and see the effects of cirrhosis of the liver.
23558	Elliot	J.D.! You knew I was gonna do that!
23559	J.D.	But it was still very startling!
23560	Daisy	Here's your shirt, Dr. Reid.
23561	Elliot	Wow, Daisy! Enjoy your weekend, you little scrapper!

23563	Daisy	It's my trophy.
23564	&	Ohh!
23565	Nurse Roberts	Hey, this guy's coding.
23566	J.D.'s Narration	Don't get me wrong, I can handle a code. But every so often, every single thing that can conceivably go wrong with a patient goes wrong at once.
23567	Nurse Roberts	He's in VF.
23568	Nurse #1	We've lost an airway.
23569	Nurse #2	He's blown a pupil.
23570	J.D.	Okay, just gimme a second, all right?

23576	J.D.	T-O-T-O Toto.
23577	Elliot	Okay, he's stable.
23578	J.D.'s Narration	See, my problem is that I've just never been much of a multi-tasker. For instance, I can't eat and watch T.V. Or drive my scooter and answer my phone.

23598	Elliot	You know that guy that crashed this morning is doing great?
23599	Dr. Cox	Oh, Barbie. Maybe you could take a break from congratulating yourself and figure out what's wrong with Mrs. Kasuba over there, seeing as you're her doctor and she's been in the I.C.U. for three days.
23600	Elliot	We're, um, running lots of tests.
23601	Dr. Cox	Tests? Oh , goody! And what exactly will you be looking for? And if it's the slowest doctor in the hospital, then ding! ding! ding! ding! I already found her. Figure it out.
23602	J.D.'s Narration	See, this is why it doesn't bother me that Elliot is so much better with the train wreck codes. Her biggest weakness is my biggest strength diagnosis.
23603	J.D.	Elliot, if you need help, just ask Dr. Diagnosis. You could be my side-kick! Bangs McCoy!
23604	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23605	J.D.'s Narration	Lately it seemed like Turk was being a little casual about his diabetes.
23606	Turk	Okay, you all know the rules. I test my blood sugar, you bet high or low, and twenty-five percent goes to diabetes. Because if we all work hard, together...I can get a big-ass flat screen.
23607	Carla	That's right, baby!
23608	Turk	Mm-hmm.
23609	Nurse Roberts	I want high.
23610	J.D.	Low and slow, that's his tempo!
23611	Elliot	This game is sick. High.
23612	Turk	194.
23613	Carla	That high, baby? You've been sneaking brownies, haven't you?
23614	Turk	I'm gonna name him Gizmo.
23615	J.D.	That's what we were gonna name our robot!
23616	Turk	Oh, well, when we get the robot, we'll just name him TuPac.
23617	J.D.	"TuPac, may I please have some waffles?" "Would you like some sy-rup?" Yeah, that'd be fine. It'll work. It's a good idea.
23618	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23619	Elliot	Maybe Mrs. Kasuba has a perinephric abscess?
23620	J.D.	No, her pain is central, not near the back. Come on, Bangs! You know what helps me when I'm diagnosing? Mentally picturing everything. Like those sugar packets there. How do you think they got there?
23621	Elliot	Somebody probably knocked them over.
23622	J.D.	I don't think so. You see, the packets are neatly stacked. Plus that coffee cup has the lipstick of a certain very hot Nurse Tisdale.
23623	Todd	If you're looking for sugar, there's some on the floor.
23624	Todd	Thonnnnnnng!
23625	J.D.	It's the classic Todd Thong Sugar Trap.
23626	Elliot	Wow.
23627	J.D.	Now, let's apply the same thing to Mrs. Kasuba. We know this isn't the first time she's experienced abdominal pain. What else do we know about her?
23628	Elliot	Oh, you know what, J.D.? Um, I've gotta run. Are you okay here?
23629	J.D.	Yeah, I got this.
23630	Dr. Cox	Say, that was some real Nancy Drew stuff, there...Nancy. I mean, absolutely irrelevant as far as medicine goes, but damn amusing!
23631	J.D.	Don't feel weird because you're threatened by my gift. Many are.
23632	Dr. Cox	Did you feel that you weren't quite annoying enough without adding a delusional sense of grandeur? Because I promise you, you are annoying enough. In fact, you're the number one contender for the middle weight annoyance crown.
23633	J.D.	Well, you're the number one jealous...weight for the jealous weight... jealous ch-champ.
23634	Dr. Cox	He's done it! He's done it! Dorian's the Most! Annoying! Man in the World! Who would've ever thought a journeyman annoyer like Dorian might....
23635	J.D.	You are a close second!
23636	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23637	Carla	I have a couple of announcements. There's a serious problem around here with not getting to know our patients. Yes, the doctor told you to administer Halidol, but why is he prescribing it? Does the patient have a chance of sundowning or is he prone to psychotic breaks and needs to be tied down? You have to ask these questions, right Tammy?
23638	Tammy	Mm-hmm.
23639	Nurse Roberts	Child, we are swamped. Where you think we're gonna get that kind of time?
23640	Carla	Laverne, if you care you'll go the extra mile. Like my husband. Turk?
23641	Turk	Hm?
23642	Carla	You have three patients on the floor. What can you tell us about them?
23643	Turk	Well, I'm cutting out that guy's appendix, I'm sewing up her lacerated spleen, and I'm slicing off that dude's foot.
23644	Carla	Great. And why are you doing those things?
23645	Turk	Because it says so on the charts.
23646	Turk	What'd I do?
23647	Elliot	J.D.! You up for some coffee?
23648	J.D.	I can't. I've almost got Mrs. Kasuba's condition figured out.
23649	Janitor	Hey, I'll, uh, join you for a cup of mud.
23650	Elliot	Great! Meet me downstairs in five minutes.
23651	Janitor	I'll be there. Just let me wash this, uh, glue off my hands.
23652	J.D.	What was he gluing?
23653	J.D.	Not again.
23654	J.D.	I can't believe you're going on a date with the Janitor!
23655	Elliot	J.D., it's just coffee. It's not a date.
23656	Janitor	Milady.
23657	Elliot	I have to go.
23658	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23659	Turk	Baby, don't be mad, you know about surgeons. We're hammers, and our patients are nails. And hammers don't get to know nails; they hammer them. Why? Because...hammers.
23660	Carla	For the last time, Turk, I'm not gonna call you The Hammer.
23661	Turk	Yeah, but none of the other hammers get to know their patients.
23662	Carla	Yeah, well, none of them get to do what you did to me last night either.
23663	Carla	Come on, Buppie, give it to me.
23664	Carla	See? When I clap my hands at the same time, it looks totally real.
23665	Turk	I know. Let's go freak out J.D.!
23666	Turk	Okay, fine, I'll try. One condition: Gimme some!
23667	Ted	Oh my God!
23668	Dr. Kelso	I think it, and she does it!
23669	J.D.	Acute intermittent porphyria! I figured it out! All right, who's got Dr. Cox's pager number?
23670	J.D.	Oh, who'm I kidding, I've got my Perry's Pager Song.
23671	J.D.'s Thoughts	"Dr. Cox at my door, pager 324."
23672	J.D.	There it is. Laverne, I'm gonna need you to get Mrs. Kasuba started on IV dextrose and hemotin.
23673	Nurse Roberts	Dr. Reid already ordered that.
23674	J.D.	She what?
23675	Elliot	Um, you know what, J.D., I've gotta run. Are you okay here?
23676	J.D.	She figured it out before me.
23677	J.D.'s Narration	There are a lot of things that can knock a guy on his ass.
23678	Turk	All right now, before we start, just in case my wife asks and she probably will what did this guy do to get his foot cut off?
23679	J.D.'s Narration	Whether it's catching a glimpse of what the future might hold....
23680	Surgical Nurse	He has diabetes.
23681	J.D.'s Narration	Or realizing you've just done the most embarrassing thing in your life.
23682	Janitor	Stupid Janitor. Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid.
23683	J.D.'s Narration	But even that's not as bad as it can get.
23684	J.D.	Why didn't you tell me?
23685	Elliot	I just thought that after I bailed you out of that train wreck code that you could, you know, use a win.
23686	Dr. Cox	Great diagnosis there, Barbie.
23687	Elliot	It wasn't me. J.D. figured it out.
23688	Dr. Cox	Well, then, nice job, Nancy.
23689	J.D.'s Narration	The worst thing is realizing when a friend is taking pity on you.
23690	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23691	J.D.'s Narration	I've never been a great liar.
23692	J.D.	Lookin' straight, Bruce.
23693	J.D.'s Narration	That's why I knew it'd be better for me if I just fessed up to Dr. Cox.
23694	J.D.	Elliot diagnosed Mrs. Kasuba, not me.
23695	Dr. Cox	I know. And your guilty anguish is it's delicious. It's like a little mini-meal between lunch and dinner. Quite frankly, it's all I can do not to grind pepper on your head.
23696	J.D.	I don't get it. When did she become a better doctor than me?
23697	Dr. Cox	Probably during one of those countless times you were goofing off?
23698	J.D.	Eh! As soon as I step foot in this hospital, I'm all business.
23699	J.D.	Good morning, Dr. Cox! From the world's most giant doctor!
23700	J.D.	Well, that was outside the hospital. Plus, Elliot was the legs. Sure, she's skinny, but she's thick through the trunk.
23701	Dr. Cox	You're finally at that stage where you and your equally undistinguished colleagues have all had enough training to be able to help each other. So no matter how humiliating it may seem, if you know somebody who's better than you and I'm bettin' that you do? you had best tuck that ridiculously feminine tail of yours between your legs and go ask her for help. I'm thinkin' that's just about it. Yep. I, uh, gosh, I'm all out of speeches. I don't think I have, uh, another one on me. I...I don't. The Oh. These are...my goodbye guns.
23702	J.D.	Those aren't real guns.

23704	Carla	Why is my stapler on the floor?
23705	Todd	Thonnnnnnnng!
23706	Todd	Face-five! Oh, yeah!
23707	Turk	Oh, you taught Todd the slap thing?
23708	Carla	Nope. How was surgery?
23709	Turk	Oh, it was fine.
23710	Nurse Roberts	Honey bear! You look blue. Have a cookie.
23711	Carla	Nah-ah-ah, Laverne. No more jackin' up my man's blood sugar just so you can buy yourself a camper.
23712	Turk	So this is all a big joke to you guys? 'Cause this is my life, and I don't think it's funny.
23713	Nurse Roberts	Now I gotta try to get back in on that craps game in the basement.
23714	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23715	Janitor	I don't know, this whole Blonde Doctor situation has me mortified. I've gathered the brain trust here to help me figure a way out of this.
23716	Randall	Uh-oh, bro. There she is.
23717	Troy	You want me to hobble her?
23718	Janitor	That's not hobbling, that's that's...poking. What's the matter with you? Here's a chance to learn a lesson as a group, okay? Sometimes you've just gotta face the music and own up to what you've done.
23719	Janitor	Hi...Blonde Doctor. Um, before, when we almost had coffee? Uh, I feel like I made you feel uncomfortable.
23720	Elliot	No, I...wasn't, um
23721	Janitor	Well, it-it you know the only reason I was wearing the suit at all was because our, uh, a cappella band was...practicing.
23722	Elliot	Oh, that's great! What's your band's name?
23723	Janitor	Uh.... It's, uh, Hibbleton. Yeah, yeah. And, um, I don't think it's going too far to say that we're the best hospital employee band in town.
23724	Ted's Band	Oh, really?
23725	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23726	J.D.	I'll clear his airway!
23727	Elliot	His O2-sat is dropping, his abdomen is distended, we need you to do a lavage. What are you gonna do?
23728	J.D.	Dammit!
23729	Elliot	J.D., it's okay. Look, it's good practice. It's why we're down here.
23730	Doug	You know, I don't really like you guys playing with my cadavers.
23731	Elliot	Oh, really, Doug? So how come that one over there has a soda in his hand?
23732	Doug	He keeps it cold!
23733	J.D.	And how come when we walked in you were sitting in a circle with three corpses playing Texas hold 'em?
23734	Doug	Just call first from now on!
23735	J.D.	I just, I don't know what to do when everything goes wrong at once. It's it's it's overwhelming.
23736	Elliot	You wanna know what my big secret is? Just take one big breath. Everything will slow down and you can just tackle each thing as it comes.
23737	J.D.	That's your big secret? Breathing?
23738	Elliot	Why do you have such a problem with me teaching you stuff?
23739	J.D.	It's just that you're a little smug.
23740	Elliot	You called yourself Dr. Diagnosis and made me your side-kick. J.D., you've been the golden boy around here for the past three years while I have cried in closets and hid from Dr. Cox and relied on you every single day to get me through it. I mean, now that I am finally doing well enough to pay you back, maybe you can tell me why you're being such an unbelievable jerk?
23741	J.D.	Because you're the one that's supposed to struggle not me.
23742	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23743	Carla	Baby. What's going on with you?
23744	Turk	Ever since I got this thing? I've been joking around about it, sneaking cookies, and hiding from it. All because I'm scared to ask myself the questions: Is it gonna get worse? Or are our kids gonna have it? Or how old am I gonna be when it finally gets me? ...You don't understand.
23745	Carla	I don't understand? Turk, look at me, I'm a WOD.
23746	Turk	I keep trying to tell you this, but it's the mirror in the bathroom, baby. You haven't gained a pound since I met you!
23747	Carla	No, I'm a WOD Wife Of Diabetic. That's what they call us in all the diabetic chat rooms. I spend a lot of time on the computer, talking about how proud I am of my husband and how he's handling this. How he's able to make jokes about it and money. It's okay to be afraid, I am. But I have to tell you, I don't know what I would do if you suddenly became someone who let something own you.

23752	Elliot	Your your band didn't even sing yet.
23753	Ted's Band	Aww.
23754	Janitor	There's no need. You win!
23755	Ted's Band	Woo.
23756	Elliot	Oh, come on, Janitor? For me?
23757	Janitor	One second. Bring it in.
23758	Janitor	Oh, God.... Okay, I don't ask for much, just a little help with a stain every now and then. I'd like to be able to communicate with animals.... But right now, oh boy, we need a miracle.

23765	Nurse	BP's dropping.
23766	Nurse Roberts	He's becoming bradycardic.

23771	J.D.	Dopamine, run it wide open. Get me an airway, I need a pacing wire. No pulse.
23772	J.D.'s Narration	I think the second you stop fighting it, time really is on your side.
23773	J.D.'s Narration	And you can go on being who you are.

23775	J.D.	To you!
23776	Elliot	Cheers!
23777	J.D.	Oh, Elliot, that's impossible. I mean, I know you've got strong legs, and you're
23778	Dr. Cox	I need you to place an IV on the second floor, room 208.
23779	J.D.	Greetings! Ha ha! Ha ha! I'm the world's most, most giant doctor! Whoa!
23780	Elliot	Oh!
23781	J.D.	Little help? Little help!
23782	Dr. Cox	Sure, sure, sure.
23783	J.D.	Yeah, sure. Not that kind of help. Agh.
23784	J.D.	If I let go, will you guys catch me?

23791	J.D.	Wow, that is the worst broken nose I have ever seen.
23792	Woman	I'm here because I stepped on a nail.
23793	J.D.	Of course.
23794	J.D.'s Thoughts	Were you walking on your nose?
23795	J.D.	Unfortunately you're gonna have to wait a little bit longer, okay? 'Cause we admit people by severity of condition.
23796	J.D.	That was mortifying.
23797	Woman	AAAAGGGGHHH! MY FACE! OWWWWWW! Owowowowowowow!
23798	J.D.	You know, with the face burns we could probably admit you now. Laverne?
23799	J.D.	Agh!
23800	J.D.'s Thoughts	My "me time" hand!
23801	Carla	Oh, and two, you know, Friday night there's a chamber orchestra playing in the courtyard of the museum.
23802	Elliot	Oh, I'd love that!
23803	Carla	You wanna go?
23804	Elliot	Oh my God, I love Pachelbel!
23805	Carla	We can go right after....
23806	J.D.'s Narration	Carla and Elliot were going through their weekly ritual of making plans they were never going to keep.
23807	Elliot	...Um...
23808	Carla	We should have dinner beforehand.
23809	Elliot	Perfect!
23810	J.D.'s Narration	And since Turk knew these were fake plans, he used the opportunity to score bonus points with his wife. Classic husbanding.
23811	Turk	Hey, baby! You know what? Forget dinner I'll make you a homemade picnic basket.
23812	Elliot	Oh!
23813	Carla	I married an amazing man.
23814	Turk	You sure did! You know what? I've got an even better idea. Maybe J.D. and I can both come right? we'll wear sport coats, and you guys, beautiful dresses!
23815	Elliot	Oh my God, I love that idea!
23816	Carla	I love it. I love it. It's awesome. It's awesome!
23817	J.D.'s Narration	To be perfectly honest, so did I. I never get an opportunity to wear my houndstooth sports coat.
23818	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23819	J.D.'s Narration	Unlike Elliot and Carla, when Turk and I made plans we kept them.
23820	Turk	It's 10 o'clock. You ready?
23821	J.D.	Let's do it.
23822	J.D.'s Narration	But lately for us, our plans rarely involved leaving the apartment.
23823	Turk	I wasn't too excited about taking over this spot after you sat in it for twenty minutes, but I gotta tell ya, it's warm in all the right places.
23824	J.D.	Mm-hmm.
23825	Turk	How do you like what I left you over there?
23826	J.D.	Oh, man, your ass indentation is so deep, it's like I'm sitting in a giant inner tube.
23827	J.D.'s Narration	As Turk and I recuperated from our big chair swap, I wondered what other couples were doing tonight. Did I just refer to Turk and I as a couple? My point is, I'm sure other couples were out having fun.
23828	Dr. Cox	You look so hot. When's the last time we kissed?
23829	Jordan	About a month ago.
23830	Dr. Cox	When's the last time we had sex?
23831	Jordan	Yesterday.
23832	Dr. Cox	Whatta you say we head into the bathroom of this place and lower the health code rating from an A to a B? Whatta you say?
23833	J.D.'s Narration	I guess some people figure, What's the worst that can happen?
23834	Dr. Cox	Well?
23835	Jordan	It's blue. I'm not pregnant.
23836	Dr. Cox	Ohh.
23837	Jordan	You know what's weird? I'm relieved, I just feel...kinda sad, because I think about how beautiful our son is and I...kinda wish it had gone the other way, you know?
23838	Jordan	Sweetie?

23844	J.D.	For the last time, Jerry, you're not dead! Okay? Now go back to your room!
23845	J.D.	Jerry has Cotard's, or "walking corpse," Syndrome. The guy thinks he's dead even though he's walking around.
23846	J.D.'s Thoughts	I think I'll try to ask Turk something telepathically.
23847	Turk	Dude, yeah. Let's hang out and watch some TV. We got any beer?
23848	J.D.	I think I used the last of it to make our special party ice.
23849	Carla	Hey! If I accidentally put beer cubes in my orange juice again, there's gonna be trouble. I almost got a D.U.I. because of you guys!
23850	Turk	Do you mean an Irish brother or an Irish...bruthah?
23851	Turk	Top of the mizzle to ya, me lizzles.
23852	Carla	I mean his sibling.
23853	J.D.	Aw, man.
23854	J.D.	And you must be the Irish brother.

23862	Carla	Ohh, Elliot, I was really looking forward to this!
23863	Elliot	Oh.
23864	Janitor	Really? 'Cause about five seconds ago you were all giddy about going home and taking a bath tonight.
23865	Carla	Why would you do that to me?
23866	Janitor	New thing: I'm bustin' chops.
23867	Elliot	So...you just forgot we even had plans?
23868	Carla	What's the big deal? You were flaking on them anyway.
23869	Elliot	I wasn't. I have my Cantonese class.
23870	Janitor	But do you? Do you really?
23871	Janitor	Bustin' chops.
23872	Elliot	Fine! At least I remembered the plans well enough to flake on them!
23873	Carla	Oh, yeah? Well, if I knew you were gonna flake on them, I would've never made plans to forget in the first place, 'cause you...
23874	Dr. Cox	She's gone, Carla. It's over.
23875	Carla	Where the hell have you been for the last few days?
23876	Dr. Cox	Deep-sea fishing.
23877	Carla	You hate fishing.
23878	Dr. Cox	Went with my buddies.
23879	Carla	You don't have any buddies.
23880	Dr. Cox	Oh, yeah? Well, we landed a two hundred pound white marlin off the coast of San Diego.
23881	Janitor	Interesting. 'Cause that's three thousand miles from the natural habitat of the white marlin. Hmm. Well, perhaps it hopped a train from Cape Cod!
23882	Dr. Cox	Why!?
23883	Janitor	I'm bustin' chops today. You can ask anybody.
23884	Carla	It's true.
23885	Janitor	See?
23886	Carla	So what did you really do? And why are you limping?
23887	Jordan	Perry!
23888	Dr. Cox	I got a vasectomy. Do not tell Jordan!
23889	Jordan	Welcome back, Perry! Hi!
23890	Dr. Cox	Ohhh, honey! Howwwww I missed you!
23891	Jordan	Mwah! Hi!
23892	Dr. Cox	Ohhhh, hi!
23893	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23894	Turk	Come on, Billy, just say it.
23895	Billy	For the last time, lads: no.
23896	J.D.	Oh, then perhaps you're not really Irish.
23897	Billy	FINE! Pink hearts, yellow moons, orange stars, green clovers.
23898	J.D.	See! I told ya!
23899	&	Yeah!
23900	J.D.	He's Irish!
23901	Turk	Yeah he is, yeah he is!
23902	Billy	How long're you two seeing each other? You're a great couple.
23903	J.D.	Ohh, no, man, we're just living together. And not like, like, livin' together, I mean, like, liiiivin' together!
23904	Billy	Oh, yeah, I got this, I snuck onto a plane, thought it was going to Belgium, ended up in Kenya. Long story short, I hung out with this tribe; when the males go through adolescence, they get this tattoo. It means "alias."
23905	J.D.	Oh, why "alias"?
23906	Billy	It's their favorite show.
23907	&	Ohhhh.
23908	Billy	I'm only kiddin'. I don't know what it means.
23909	Billy	Enough about me. What about you lads, you know, saving lives here all day every day? Out at night, givin' out a lash, tearin' it up? You do go out at night, don't ya?
23910	J.D.	Do you have any sevens?
23911	J.D.	Turk!
23912	J.D.	You have lots of sevens!
23913	J.D.	We tear it.
23914	Turk	And and and sometimes lash, but with the hours we work, it's....
23915	J.D.	It's less tearing and more folding.
23916	Turk	Right.
23917	J.D.	Gently folding.
23918	Turk	Yeah.
23919	Billy	Lads! You're sleepin' off and you're dead and buried. You have to get out in the streets, you have to talk to a stranger. Drink a beer with breakfast! Take the ugliest girl home at the party!
23920	J.D.	Done it! Done that. That one I've done.
23921	Billy	Go travelin' to Texas, you know? Go line dancing with some married women that wish they weren't married. You never know what life would put in your lap when you open your arms and embrace it!
23922	J.D.	"You'll be surprised what'll fall in your lap if you open up and embrace life..."
23923	Turk	Dude.
23924	J.D.	Elliot!
23925	Elliot	He said my eyes look like the Irish countryside after a soft rain. Ahem. I should go.
23926	J.D.	That happened very quickly.
23927	Turk	Don't even sweat it. It's Elliot. She's desperate!
23928	J.D.	Dude.
23929	Turk	Baby!
23930	Carla	What? What? I wasn't gonna do anything! He said my hair was curly.
23931	Billy	Your hair is curly.
23932	&	BABY!
23933	Carla	Okay!
23934	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23935	Dr. Cox	What, uh, what did you do around the apartment while I was gone?
23936	Jordan	Oh! I turned your little office into my pajama closet, I threw out everything in the 'frigerator that had the word "jerky" or "whiz" on it, I got rid of all your clothes that make you look like you're twenty years old don't worry, I saved your hockey jerseys. Although I did move them into my new...pajama closet! And for some reason none of the remotes work anymore. And why are you limping?
23937	Dr. Cox	Fishing? I'm limping from fishing.
23938	Dr. Kelso	I know that limp.
23939	Dr. Cox	No, Bob. Bob, no.
23940	Dr. Kelso	You just got a vasectomy! I had mine done back in '68. Ironically, that was the same year that Enid discovered pasta and I discovered I'm not attracted to enormous women.
23941	Dr. Cox	I didn't just get a vasectomy.
23942	Dr. Kelso	Come on, soldier! If I have to force you to drop your pants, I will!
23943	Dr. Cox	Snip it, doc. Snip it hard.
23944	Dr. Cox	Yeah, we...we really...struggled...with it.
23945	Dr. Kelso	I don't really care.
23946	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23947	Billy	You l'right, love?
23948	Carla	Mmm.
23949	Elliot	Why are you waving? You're married.
23950	Carla	So what? Married people can't wave now?
23951	Elliot	You can wave like this: You can't wave like this: Mmm.
23952	Carla	I didn't know you were a waving expert. What plans of ours did you flake on to go to that waving seminar?
23953	Elliot	Oh, why are you asking me? Did you forget?! You big plan forgetter.
23954	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23955	Carla	Oh, snap! Did you just call me a hussy!?
23956	Elliot	Desperate hussy!
23957	Todd	Oh, whoa, whoa! Ladies, stop!
23958	Todd	Continue.
23959	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23960	Turk	So, Billy, we're gonna need to get your brother's insurance information.
23961	Billy	Oh, he's not me brother. Sure'n I only met the fellow last night, God bless him.
23962	J.D.'s Narration	In life, we often make assumptions that aren't true.
23963	J.D.'s Narration	Whether it's assuming you know how someone's gonna react...
23964	Dr. Cox	Okay, let me have it.
23965	Jordan	Whatever makes you happy, sweetie. See you at home.
23966	J.D.'s Narration	...Or assuming that a little girl from Connecticut would never fight dirty.
23967	Todd	I'm going in!
23968	J.D.'s Narration	The crazy thing is most assumptions could be avoided if you just asked a simple question in the first place.
23969	J.D.	Well, if you're not his brother, then who are you?
23970	Billy	Me? I'm the bloke that hit him.
23971	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
23972	Turk	Billy, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
23973	Billy	Lads, it was an accident, right? He threw the first punch, then I hit him, he slipped, hit his head on the bar. Now, listen, where I come from, you knock someone unconscious, you stay around, you make sure they're okay. Right? So, guess what? I won't be leaving.
23974	J.D.	Well, then, you're gonna have to deal with me and my partner.
23975	J.D.	I mean, like, my my partner, not like my my partner.
23976	Turk	Can I talk to you outside for a second?
23977	Billy	How you doing?
23978	Jerry	Not great, actually. I'm dead.
23979	Billy	Bummer. How long?
23980	Jerry	Four years next month.
23981	Billy	Geez, that's a nightmare. I was dead once, for about ten minutes. Then me mate Danny peed on me head.
23982	Jerry	Really.
23983	Billy	It's quite a sight to wake up to, though.
23984	Turk	Heard you guys were fighting.
23985	Carla	We made up.
23986	Janitor	No they didn't.
23987	Janitor	Chop bustin'. And doc dustin'.
23988	Turk	Well, Elliot, you don't look too banged up about it you got your arm around Carla.
23989	Elliot	My hand is stuck in this rat's nest that she calls hair!
23990	Carla	Dye job!
23991	Nurse Roberts	Got it! But, Chopstick, you're gonna have to buy a new watch. And Carla, you may wanna borrow some of my spray-on hair.
23992	Turk	Baby
23993	J.D.	No, dude, forget them. We have to deal with Billy. Now, should we call the cops on this guy or what?
23994	Turk	I don't know, man, he seems cool.
23995	J.D.	He put a guy in the hospital; that's a felony. And as doctors we're supposed to report him.
23996	Turk	Are you trying to convince me to do something that you already did? 'Cause you know that drives me crazy!
23997	J.D.	No! This is a decision we both need to make! Together! As a team, as a unit!
23998	Turk	All right, fine, let's call the cops.
23999	J.D.	Thank God.
24000	Policeman	Hello, gentlemen. We got a call about a felony from a Dr. Turk?
24001	J.D.	"Turk"'s easier to hear over the phone.
24002	J.D.'s Narration	"Dorian" isn't hard to hear over the phone. But I didn't really want to talk about it with Turk.
24003	Dr. Cox	I went behind Jordan's back and got my junk rewired. She was sweet to me. Sweet, Bobbo. What the hell do you make of that?
24004	Elliot	Carla thinks she's so tough, you know? She's "been around the block." She's "from the block." Enough about the block! It's not my fault my family had an orchard.
24005	Carla	For four years I've had to listen to Elliot complain about her problems. "My parents are too rich." "I slept with J.D. again." "Why can't I gain any weight?" I have problems of my own! I'm from the block!
24006	Jerry	I wanted to help her, I just wish she could've heard me.
24007	Carla	Okay, Jerry, you're out.
24008	Nurse Roberts	Mm-hmm?
24009	Carla	Can I talk to you?
24010	Dr. Kelso	Perry, believe me when I say I'm proud to welcome you to what I like to call the "seedless grapes club." But still....
24011	Janitor	I have just one obvious and hopefully chop-busting question....
24012	Nurse Roberts	Why the hell are you talking to me about this?
24013	Carla	I guess I should be talking to her.
24014	Dr. Cox	Jordan? Jordan, why aren't you more upset about this? I, honest to God, I don't get it. I mean, normally you'd go to your mother's for a bitch refresher course, and then you'd come right back here just swinging for the fences.
24015	Jordan	You know what, I'd love to stay and chat, but if we're late for ballet, Jack won't get a spot by the bathroom and then he'll pee in his tights.
24016	Dr. Cox	I'm sorry, my son is taking...is taking ballet? Come on, Jordan, he's already got an overbearing mother and a fairly prominent lisp. If we stick him in the tights, well, we might as well just go ahead and get him a timeshare on Fire Island.
24017	Jordan	Oh, I haven't even decided if I'm gonna make him gay yet.
24018	Dr. Cox	Oh. I see what this is. This is "the payback," ah?
24019	Jordan	Perry! I didn't freak out 'cause you and I are two very independent people in a relationship and we don't always share our feelings. I didn't get angry because I'm not surprised.
24020	Jack	Ba-ba.
24021	Jordan	Let's go ballet!
24022	Jordan	Do I wish it were different? Sometimes. But, whatever you and I have is working, so I guess I just have to live with it.
24023	Doctor	So, how you feeling down there?
24024	Dr. Cox	Oh, great. Great. Reverse it.
24025	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24026	Billy	See ya, lads.
24027	Turk	Ohh, man!
24028	J.D.	I know we feel guilty, okay? But it's over. It's not like there's gonna be any ramifications.
24029	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24030	Nurse Roberts	You have one day to come up with another gorgeous Irishman.
24031	Todd	One day.
24032	Todd	What? The Todd appreciates hot, regardless of gender!
24033	Elliot	I'm glad Billy's gone. He's such a jerk. He kept calling me "bonny."
24034	Carla	"Bonny" means "pretty."
24035	Elliot	Oh, my God! I will never love like that again!
24036	Carla	You know I wasn't really mad about Billy or the whole flaking thing. I remember hugging you the day of my wedding and thinking to myself, even though the other two bridesmaids were my sisters, I felt closer to you.
24037	Elliot	When did we stop being best friends? I mean, it feels like it took us so long to get to that point and that it's gone away so quickly, you know?
24038	Carla	Well, my fault. Been burying myself in being married.
24039	Elliot	Oh, please, it was your first year. I mean, I should've been the one to make the extra effort.
24040	Carla	So what now?
24041	Elliot	We try harder.
24042	Carla	All right.
24043	Elliot	When you grow up in an orchard, you don't have much choice.
24044	Elliot	Apple thieves.
24045	Carla	Ahhh.
24046	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24047	Jordan	What the hell happened to you?
24048	Dr. Cox	I got them to reverse the vasectomy.
24049	Jordan	What an incredibly normal thing to do!
24050	Dr. Cox	Jordan, let me talk for a second. I've been trained for many years to take any emotion I feel, push it down, and then let it out by drinking way too much and by yelling at the football players on my T.V. screen. And I...I really thought I hit the jackpot when I finally met a woman who was as disturbed and closed-off as I am.
24051	Jordan	Thank you.
24052	Dr. Cox	You're welcome. Still, now I want more. I I really do. I want to talk about things. Not not everything. Not everything. I definitely, definitely don't want to talk about everything. For instance I don't need to know when you beat up a woman in the park because her purse is the same color as yours; but things that matter, things that are important to us as a as a family. And I know...I know that there are guys who bring flowers and that there are guys who write love songs. But, Jordan, I'm a guy sitting in front of you here with a twice operated-on penis that says "I want to be a couple that communicates more openly."
24053	Jordan	What kind of guy writes love songs?
24054	Dr. Cox	Guys whose mothers make them go to ballet class.
24055	Jordan	Fair enough.
24056	Dr. Cox	I love you too.
24057	Jordan	Okay, now that we're being all open and honest?
24058	Dr. Cox	Yeah.
24059	Jordan	I do not want to have any more kids. I think you should get the vasectomy!
24060	Dr. Cox	Fantastic.
24061	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24062	J.D.'s Narration	My partner and I yeah, I said it we had heard that Billy was back, and he was mad.
24063	Billy	I warned ya!
24064	J.D.	What the hell happened?
24065	Billy	He woke up and said something snarky, so I popped him again!
24066	Turk	Are you serious?!
24067	Guy	BOO!
24068	J.D.	Aaaaaaaghgggghhhhhhh!
24069	J.D.	Ohh, you think scaring people's funny, huh?! Well, good! Because you're dying!
24070	Turk	John Dorian, you are a doctor!
24071	J.D.	Well, he started it!
24072	Billy	Sorry about your face, man.
24073	Guy	Oh, please, I threw the first punch. It was my fault.
24074	Billy	Right then. I'm off.
24075	Billy	I'm supposed to be in Florence by midnight.
24076	Turk	How the hell are you gonna do that?
24077	Billy	Her apartment's two blocks away. It should be no problem at all.
24078	J.D.	Well, hey, we're sorry about the whole incarceration thing.
24079	Billy	No worries. Life's too short to hold a grudge. But still, you two boys might want to ask yourselves why you contacted the authorities but didn't have the decency to come and talk to me first. But I should let you two "partners" figure that out. By the way, you're a gorgeous couple. Good luck to ya.
24080	Billy	See ya, lads!
24081	Jerry	When I was alive, I wish I had lived one day like he lives every day of his life.
24082	J.D.	Dead people don't talk, Jerry.
24083	J.D.'s Narration	We weren't really mad at Jerry, what we realized was that we were jealous of Billy, because he was out living life and Turk and I weren't.
24084	J.D.'s Narration	Whether it's appreciating your relationships...
24085	Dr. Cox	All righty, let's go for the hat-trick, there, doc.
24086	Doctor	Are you sure?
24087	Jordan	Hey, doc! Zip it, grip it, and snip it!
24088	J.D.'s Narration	Or renewing your friendships.
24089	Carla	I almost peed!
24090	J.D.'s Narration	For Turk and I, it was important just to get out and start living life, period.
24091	Turk	Buddy, it is almost one o'clock in the morning, and we have to be at work at five.
24092	J.D.	I know, but how often do we do this?
24093	Turk	You're absolutely right, come on.
24094	Turk	Do you have any twos?
24095	J.D.	Uh, no. Go fish, please.
24096	J.D.	Do you have any Ks?
24097	Turk	Ah, please go fish.

24099	J.D.'s Narration	Even though it can be tough around here, sometimes God gives you little gifts to get you through the day.
24100	Dr. Cox	You're gonna wanna grab a mop
24101	Janitor	Shush. Watching 'The Sixth Sense'.
24102	Dr. Cox	There's a mess in the hallway.
24103	Janitor	This kid sees dead people.
24104	Dr. Cox	That film is at least five years old.
24105	Janitor	So what? I haven't seen it.
24106	Dr. Cox	Bruce Willis is a ghost. He's been dead the entire time. All the best.
24107	Janitor	Noooo! NO!
24108	J.D.	You guys, I am so excited about tonight.
24109	Carla	Settle down, we're just going to a nightclub.
24110	J.D.	No, Carla, an African-American club.
24111	Turk	Promise me you'll be cool.
24112	J.D.'s Narration	In Turk's defense, we had tried this once before.
24113	J.D.	You can't touch me.
24114	J.D.'s Narration	And once before that.
24115	J.D.	Yeeeeeaaaaah, booooooy!
24116	J.D.	Man, it's only ten o'clock.
24117	J.D.'s Narration	But, hey, third time's the charm.
24118	Bouncer	All right, you three can go in.
24119	J.D.	Word.
24120	Bouncer	Ah! You're out.
24121	Carla	Oh, look, sir, please, just
24122	Turk	Baby, I got this. Don't worry about this. Listen here, man, homey here, you know, he's a little outta his mizzle, so I'm just saying, for just a little bizzle, if you let him up in this pizzle, he'll be all chizzle!
24123	Bouncer	You out too.

24127	Carla	Just don't lose your head, Bambi!
24128	Carla	Turk! J.D.'s doing the
24129	Carla	Heh. Oh, God.
24130	J.D.'s Narration	After two hours of intense roboting, I was parched.
24131	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24132	Narration	And that's when I saw Kylie.
24133	J.D.	Uh, can you make me an appletini?
24134	Kylie	I hope so, it's my favorite drink.
24135	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh my God, that's a sign. If only she had my goofy sense of humor.
24136	Kylie	Ran out of vodka. Let me go downstairs and get some more.
24137	Kylie	I been working on my fake stair walk.
24138	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, time to move in for the kill. Work the fact that you're a doctor into the conversation. Just be subtle.
24139	J.D.	I'm a doctor. Uh, John Dorian. Most of my patients live.
24140	Kylie	This is so weird! I been looking for a doctor! See...
24141	J.D.'s Thoughts	My God, look at those beautiful eyes. They're so big I can see myself in them. Wow, how cute am I!
24142	Kylie	...so it's probably nothing big, but I'm wondering if you could check it out?
24143	J.D.	You got it! Come by Sacred Heart tomorrow, I have clinic hours. After all, I'm a doctor.
24144	Turk	Dude, I can't believe this. You're gonna date a patient! I hope she has something that keeps her here for a while so you can get to know her.
24145	J.D.	I gotta thank you for taking a special interest in this.
24146	Carla	Don't give him too much credit. He's just excited because he wishes he dated more sexy black women when he was single.
24147	Todd	Well, at least he married one.
24148	Carla	Todd, I'm not black.
24149	Todd	Right, and I'm not straight.
24150	J.D.	Do you ever get that special fluttery feeling in your heart when you feel like a woman is about to change your life?
24151	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24152	Kylie	Hey! J.D.! This is my boyfriend James. Thanks again for seeing him.
24153	Turk	How's your heart?
24154	J.D.	The fluttering has stopped.
24155	Todd	There! Is she black?
24156	Doc	Nuh-uh.
24157	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24158	J.D.	Be with you in a second.
24159	James	Thanks, doc!
24160	J.D.	It's funny, I thought you said you were the one who needed a doctor.
24161	Kylie	No, I told you it was James.
24162	J.D.	Ohh. How could I not have heard that?
24163	Kylie	Remember, I said...
24164	J.D.'s Thoughts	My God, look at those beautiful eyes. They're so bi You're doing it again!
24165	Kylie	...so, I'll see you in there.
24166	J.D.	Okay. In there, I'll see you.
24167	J.D.	Oh man, I can't believe it's over.
24168	Turk	Dude, maybe it's not that serious, all right? There could be a window. But you have to get in there and fish for information, all right? You don't want to lose this hottie! She is a slammin' hottie! And you don't wann
24169	Carla	Turk.
24170	Turk	Mm-hmm.
24171	J.D.	I got this: Baby, you know you're his world!
24172	Turk	Dude? A guy walks into a dentist's office and says, "I think I'm a moth." The dentist then says, "Well, if you think you're a moth, why'd you come to the dentist's office?" The guy then says, "Well, the light was on."
24173	J.D.	That moth is crazy!
24174	J.D.	Hey, I heard a great joke. A guy walks into a dentist's office and says, "I think I'm a moth." And the dentist says, "Well, if you think you're a moth, why are you at a dentist's office?"
24175	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, no, I forgot the punchline.... You can't bail out now! Stall! Stall!
24176	J.D.	...So the moth says..."That's a good question. What kind of dentist are you?" And the dentist says, "Well, I'm a general dentist, but I...I do dabble in orthodontry braces and such." And...and the moth says, "Orthodontry? I hear there's great money in that."
24177	J.D.'s Thoughts	"The light was on"!
24178	J.D.	"But! To answer your original question, which was, if I think I'm a moth, why am I in a dentist's office? The answer is, Because the light was on!"
24179	J.D.	The light! The light, James. Moths love light.
24180	James	I've had a fever and stomach ache for almost a week.
24181	Kylie	Mm.
24182	J.D.	Okay, well, uh, let's get a little history on you.
24183	J.D.'s Thoughts	Time to go fishing for some info.
24184	J.D.	Do you ever have any, uh, shortness of breath? For instance when you're walking Kylie to the apartment that you share?
24185	Kylie	We don't live together.
24186	J.D.'s Thoughts	Window! Window!
24187	J.D.	Oh, so you're you're waiting until you get married?
24188	Kylie	We're not engaged.
24189	James	To answer your question, I don't have any shortness of breath. But my right knee is a little puffy.
24190	J.D.	Well, maybe that's from dragging your feet! Am I right, Kylie! Heh. She knows! Okay.
24191	J.D.'s Narration	Using patient histories to your advantage is an old doctor trick. Let's face it: What a doctor says and what they mean are often two different things.
24192	Elliot	I know Dr. Robbins treated your husband in the E.R., but we're gonna approach this case a bit differently.
24193	Subtitle	Robbins is an idiot.
24194	Mrs. Chang	And it's very comforting to have the chief of medicine here.
24195	Dr. Kelso	I took a special interest in this case.
24196	Subtitle	I was thinking about food, and accidentally wandered over here.
24197	Mrs. Chang	Oh, thank you!
24198	Todd	Hey, Elliot. Your boobies look hot today.
24199	Subtitle	Hey Elliot, your boobies look hot today.
24200	Elliot	Mr. Chang's test results showed that he's in renal failure. We're just waiting for the results of his blood smear.
24201	Dr. Kelso	No need. I saw his chart right before I went to the bakery. He's got malaria.
24202	Elliot	And you were going to tell him this after you had a sticky bun?
24203	Dr. Kelso	Well, in my defense, he's going to live at least another twelve hours and the bakery closes at five.
24204	Elliot	Well, we've gotta get moving on this! What should we do?
24205	Dr. Kelso	Nothing. Mr. Chang is not long for this world.
24206	Elliot	Do you believe that guy?
24207	Dr. Cox	I never cease to be amazed by the depth of his cynicism and callousness.
24208	Elliot	So, what do you think we should do?
24209	Dr. Cox	Oh, I don't care. I'm going home to watch the Lakers play the Heat. It's the game of the year Shaq versus Kobe. And you are going to stay here and deal with this yourself.
24210	Elliot	Shaq versus Kobe?
24211	Dr. Cox	All the best. Ooh! Let it happen! Three, two, one! Ahhhhhh!
24212	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24213	J.D.	What's this stretch good for?
24214	Turk	It loosens up my chest. But you should probably stretch too.
24215	J.D.	Don't need to, buddy I got a tube of Ben-Gay on each one of my hamstrings.
24216	Turk	How things going with Kylie?
24217	J.D.	They're okay. Is there some special way to get a black girl to like you?
24218	Turk	Dude, the only difference between a black girl and a white girl is that when a black girl asks you if her ass looks big?
24219	J.D.	Uh-huh?
24220	Turk	You say, "Hell yeah!"
24221	J.D.	All right!
24222	Turk	Okay! You wanna play some ball?
24223	J.D.	Hell, yes!
24224	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24225	Elliot	Dr. Kelso, I have thought about it, and I am not going to just stand around and wait for Mr. Chang to die.
24226	Dr. Kelso	Excuse me?
24227	Dr. Cox	Are you kidding me? Barbie going toe-to-toe with Big Bob in a battle of the annoyings? Well, happy birthday to me!
24228	Elliot	We should do an exchange transfusion.
24229	Dr. Cox	And the southpaw with the blonde bangs and the big britches comes out sa-winging!
24230	Dr. Kelso	Sweetheart, the man is seventy-two and in multisystem organ dysfunction. It's done! It's parasites one, person zero! And if you tell that family he's got a chance, all you're doing is raising their hopes.
24231	Dr. Cox	Ohhh! Tremendous body blow!
24232	Dr. Kelso	Oh, and for the record, we're not colleagues. I don't care what you think.
24233	Dr. Cox	Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! And the fight goes to the stocky middleweight from Monroeville, Pennsylvania!
24234	Dr. Kelso	By the way, Perry, Mickhead called in sick. I need you to work tonight.
24235	Dr. Cox	Well, yeah, that's well and good, but I'm not available.
24236	Dr. Cox	There is no chance I am missing this game! No chance, no how!
24237	Dr. Cox	What the...? Say, Bob, what the hell happened in your office?
24238	Dr. Kelso	Oh, every year the med students get me with a practical joke. They messed with the speed control on my treadmill.
24239	Dr. Kelso	What I can't figure is how they got into my office.
24240	Ted	Here's the key to Kelso's office.
24241	Dr. Cox	And here's Nurse Tisdale's phone number.
24242	Dr. Cox	I don't have any idea how they might have gotten in here, Bob. But I can tell you this: If you think I'm missing the biggest game of the year, you got another thing
24243	Dr. Kelso	I hate to interrupt you, but I'm still feeling a little woozy from being shot into my wall like a lawn dart. So why don't you just go work your shift and use my VCR to tape the game?
24244	Dr. Cox	When did you get this?
24245	Dr. Kelso	Right about the time we couldn't afford that M.R.I. machine.
24246	Dr. Cox	Ah, of course you did.
24247	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24248	J.D.	Hey, Kylie, I wrote down that moth joke for you.
24249	Kylie	Wow.
24250	J.D.'s Thoughts	Give her a compliment. Tell her she has a huge ass!
24251	J.D.	You
24252	Kylie	What happened to your eye?
24253	J.D.	Oh, this, it's a little embarrassing. I was playing baske
24254	Turk	Embarrassing for me, actually, see....
24255	J.D.	Yeah. I ally-ooped him.
24256	Turk	Shut up.
24257	Kylie	Mmm! You coulda used J.D. at Seton Hall!
24258	Turk	Oh, also, the soup kitchen where you volunteer called, and they said You played ball at Seton Hall?
24259	James	All four years.
24260	Turk	Get outta here!
24261	J.D.	Did-did-did the soup kitchen where I volunteer have a message?
24262	Turk	Yeah, they're out of broth. So what was like playing college ball?
24263	James	Oh, man, it's bett
24264	Kylie	Sweetie, I'm gonna go to the cafeteria and get you a coffee.
24265	James	Oh, okay.
24266	Turk	Hell, no! Sweetie ain't drinking no cafeteria coffee! Sweetie, you are drinking the coffee from the doctors' lounge!
24267	Turk	Let's. Seton Hall, huh? That is...
24268	J.D.	Thank you. Your test results, let's see what's going on.
24269	James	Oh, no, we haven't slept together...yet. It's not like I'm missing out shoot, I probably got it from my secretary. Or that trainer from the gym. Ooh, or this fine chick, Tamyra, that bartends with Kylie? Yeah.
24270	J.D.	Well, we should probably get get you fixed up, or things might start falling off of ya.
24271	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24272	Dr. Cox	Listen up. I have been cursed to work the night shift with you chuckleheads, which means I have to tape the Laker-Heat game. And seeing as no one in the history of this germ box has ever made it through a shift without saying "Oh my God, oh, my God, did you see what happened last night on America's Fattest Fatties? A 900 pound woman lost a pound and a half and cried for twenty minutes!" Be warned: If you utter a word about the score of the game, it will be your last. Now get out! Go, go, go, go, go. Chop chop!
24273	As the staffers clear out, only one person remains	The Janitor sitting in a desk chair, his back turned.
24274	J.D.'s Narration	What drives people to seek revenge?
24275	Janitor	So.... You don't want to know the ending of something? I can relate to that.
24276	Dr. Cox	What is that in your lap?
24277	Janitor	Leonard! Half kitten, half monkey!
24278	Dr. Kelso	Unfortunately, with his system failing, Dr. Reid and I have agreed there's nothing more we can do.
24279	J.D.'s Narration	What drives people to go back on their word?
24280	Elliot	If we do an exchange transfusion there's a chance we can save your father.
24281	Mrs. Chang	Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you!
24282	James	Now, you have to keep this between us you know, doctor-patient confidentiality, right?
24283	J.D.'s Narration	And what do you do when every fiber of your being wants to say something, but you know you can't?
24284	Kylie	Hey! What are you guys talking about?
24285	J.D.	Nothin'!
24286	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24287	J.D.	Why do all the good ones have boyfriends with venereal diseases but you can't say anything 'cause you're the guy's doctor?
24288	Carla	I am so sick of men screwing women over! Like cheating on them or using your lavender bath gel to wash their car!
24289	Turk	Baby, you did not just compare cheating and getting gonorrhea to me using your soap
24290	Carla	I'm just saying men let you down. J.D., you have to tell her.
24291	Turk	Baby, when J.D. became a doctor, he took the Hippocratic Oath. And I'm sorry, but there's no way around it.
24292	Kylie	Is...there an "A"?
24293	J.D.	Yes there is!
24294	Kylie	Yes!
24295	J.D.	There may be a way around it....
24296	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24297	Elliot	Thanks.
24298	Dr. Cox	Ooh, Bar-bye! You are up there without a net this time! Well, I sure do hope Mr. Chang rallies for ya, because if he doesn't, sure shootin' you're gonna be hearing Bob Kelso's voice saying "sweetheart, I told you so" from now until you are two inches shorter and driving around Florida with your left-hand blinker on.
24299	Janitor	Oh, now it's time to ruin the game! Come with me to the window!
24300	Dr. Cox	Why? What do you have, some elaborate plan?
24301	Janitor	I do, as a matter of fact. I convinced everybody in this hospital that's afraid of me to go outside and spell out the score of the game.
24302	Dr. Cox	Really?
24303	Janitor	No, you idiot. I'm just gonna tell you the score of the game...maybe knock your head against the glass.
24304	Dr. Cox	Look. I was way outta line telling you how that movie ended. But, God save me, watching sports is one of the last pure pleasures I have left in my life. So you, you tell me, what's it gonna take for you to let me go home, sit in my massage chair, and enjoy the game?
24305	Janitor	I would like...to perform open-heart surgery.
24306	Dr. Cox	No.
24307	Janitor	How about you perform surgery on me so that I can breathe under water.
24308	Dr. Cox	No.
24309	Janitor	I would like a shark that can read minds.
24310	Dr. Cox	No!
24311	Janitor	You and I trade lives for a year.
24312	Dr. Cox	No!
24313	Janitor	How about a home-cooked meal and an hour in your massage chair?
24314	Dr. Cox	Done.
24315	Janitor	Done!
24316	Outside, indeed many people are down below in the formation of the score	98-97
24317	Janitor	Hey, guys! It's off!
24318	Janitor	Wow! You guys are organized!
24319	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24320	Ted	Hey! Catch that Lakers-Heat game? Five seconds left!
24321	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24322	J.D.	I can't believe you make three hundred dollars in tips a night.
24323	Kylie	Mm-hmm. This is why doctors should have tip jars. I mean, I make three bucks for serving a martini, you put your lips on the mouth of a slobbering dead guy and bring him back to life that's gotta be worth at least a five spot!
24324	Kylie	I...should be getting back to James.
24325	J.D.	There's no rush. Uh, a nurse is up there right now getting some blood from him.
24326	James	Oh!
24327	Carla	I'm sorry! It's never taken me twelve pokes to find a vein!
24328	James	Ow!
24329	Carla	Got it! Wheeeee!
24330	Kylie	Ugh, I shoulda brought my laptop I could've gotten so much work done.
24331	J.D.	You can bartend online?
24332	Kylie	I just work at the club to pay for grad school.
24333	J.D.	Mm.
24334	Kylie	I'm getting my Masters in political science.
24335	J.D.	I love politics! Ask me anything!
24336	J.D.'s Thoughts	What are you doing?! You don't know anything about politics! You're screwed unless she asks about Bush or the bald assistant president who has all those heart attacks!
24337	Kylie	Did you know only seventeen percent of people under the age of twenty-five voted last year?
24338	J.D.	You can vote if you're under twenty-five?
24339	J.D.'s Thoughts	The only thing you can take solace in is that a girl like her would probably never be interested in you anyway.
24340	Kylie	I can't believe a cute guy like you doesn't have a girlfriend. If I was single, I'd totally snatch you up.
24341	J.D.	Would you like to play a game of Hangman?
24342	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24343	J.D.'s Narration	As I sat there letting my interns do all my work, I wondered if there was a parallel universe where another J.D. and another Kylie could be together because there's no Hippocratic Oath on planet Glornak Seven.
24344	Elliot	Are you on Glornak Seven?
24345	J.D.	Why are you so happy?
24346	Elliot	I just did an exchange transfusion on my malaria patient in there, and he just woke up on from his coma.
24347	J.D.	Well, he woke up to a world of bad boyfriends, oaths, and gonorrhea.
24348	Elliot	He sure did. And you know why? Because I broke the rules and ignored what Dr. Kelso wanted me to do.
24349	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes you have to break the rules. And Elliot's patient waking up was a clear sign that you couldn't deny.
24350	Nurse Tisdale	Mr. Chang is crashing!
24351	J.D.'s Thoughts	Signs be damned! I'm telling her!
24352	J.D.	Kylie! Kylie!
24353	Turk	Dude! You can't tell her! They won't let you be a doctor anymore!
24354	J.D.	Who cares! I'd make more money bartending!
24355	Carla	Turk! If we leave right now, I might actually be awake for sex tonight. Just go get my coat.
24356	Carla	You owe me.
24357	Turk	Baby! So, I didn't know which one was yours, so I grabbed all of 'em.
24358	Carla	Just give me a second, okay? I need to talk to Elliot, and then I gotta clock out.
24359	Turk	And then we have sex? Then we have...?
24360	Elliot	I really thought he had a shot.
24361	Carla	Well, the family's downstairs whenever you're ready to talk to them.
24362	Elliot	Go ahead. Call me sweetheart and tell me I'm a pathetic excuse for a doctor.
24363	Dr. Kelso	You made a bold decision and it bit you in the keister.
24364	Elliot	Yeah.
24365	Dr. Kelso	I don't like people disagreeing with me. There's not another resident here who has the guts to do it.
24366	Elliot	I just feel so guilty about Mr. Chang. Could you at least just...make fun of my bangs or something?
24367	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Reid, take it from a colleague. Telling that family what happened after getting their hopes up is going to be far worse than any shot I could take at that John Denver haircut you're sporting.
24368	Elliot	Did...did you just call me a colleague?
24369	Dr. Kelso	I did. But I hate my colleagues.
24370	Dr. Kelso	What the hell are you doing?
24371	Turk	I get to have sex!
24372	Dr. Kelso	I hate this place.
24373	Turk	I get to have sex tonight!
24374	J.D.	Hey, Kylie, there you are.
24375	Kylie	Hey! J.D.!
24376	J.D.'s Thoughts	This is your moment! Grab it!
24377	Kylie	I wanted to thank you for being such a great doctor.
24378	J.D.'s Narration	And there it was. Great doctors don't break oaths.
24379	Kylie	Thanks again. For everything.
24380	J.D.'s Narration	Someone once said the bad guys always win. Sometimes the bad guy is a jerk boyfriend.
24381	Sports Announcer	It's finally here! The long-awaited showdown between Shaq and Kobe!
24382	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes the bad guy is the man you've been battling with for as long as you can remember.
24383	Dr. Kelso	Hey, Perry! 98-97, Lakers. Kobe dunked over Shaq for the game winner. Don't ever mess with my treadmill!
24384	Janitor	Is this homemade gravy? Mmm!
24385	J.D.'s Narration	And sometimes the bad guy is a disease that you didn't stand a chance against.
24386	Mrs. Chang	But...you said he could get better.
24387	Elliot	I am so sorry.
24388	J.D.'s Narration	I guess all you can do is come back to work the next morning and hope that being a good guy pays off.
24389	J.D.	What are you doing here?
24390	Kylie	My girlfriend Tamyra, from the club? She's also feeling a little sick, and you'll never guess what she has.
24391	J.D.	Gonorrhea! I mean...gonorrhea.
24392	Kylie	You could tell me now.
24393	J.D.	Your boyfriend is a jerk.
24394	Kylie	He's not my boyfriend.
24395	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24396	J.D.'s Narration	Before I settled on the outfit for my first date with Kylie, I had to run it by the experts.
24397	J.D.	So be honest, but not too honest, okay, 'cause I'm feeling a little chunky.
24398	Carla	We like it.
24399	J.D.	Oh, thank god. I-I-I could have sworn I heard the word jowly.
24400	Elliot	So, uh...heh. How many outfits did you try on before you picked that one?
24401	J.D.	Not too many.
24402	Carla	You know, on a first date, I could see what a guy was wearing and know exactly how far he was gonna get that night.
24403	Elliot	Oh, me, too.
24404	Carla	Yeah, he is.
24405	Elliot	Whoa! That guy's gettin' a hug at the door. Heh.
24406	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24407	Elliot	And that guy is getting a fake name and a phone number with six digits.
24408	J.D.	I know how ridiculous this looks.
24409	Carla	I don't think you do.
24410	J.D.	But the entire ensemble works together, and the jacket never comes off.
24411	Carla	The top won't go up.
24412	J.D.	It'll be awesome.
24413	J.D.	Sorry about your hair.
24414	Kylie	Don't beat yourself up. I got a scrunchie.
24415	Kylie	There!
24416	J.D.	What the hell was that?
24417	Kylie	It's a poor little possum! We should take him to the vet!
24418	J.D.'s Narration	It was Sophie's Choice. Either heartlessly leave the possum there to die or wrap that little guy up in my sports coat and reveal the short-sleeved nerd jersey that lurked beneath.
24419	J.D.	Careful. His, uh, little hoof is bleeding on the gear shift.
24420	Kylie	Oh. Sorry.
24421	Vet	Yeah, this thing's dead. That'll be a hundred-twenty dollars.
24422	J.D.'s Thoughts	A hundred and twenty dollars for a stupid dead rat!?
24423	Kylie	I think it's so sweet that you're depressed about that poor little possum.
24424	J.D.	I'll always remember him. Little Carlton.
24425	J.D.	Anyway, we only lost about a half hour. We can still make that reservation!
24426	J.D.	Oh, there's possums everywhere!
24427	Kylie	No, no no no. It's just a box.
24428	Kylie	A...talking box.
24429	Kylie	I think your shirt stopped the bleeding.
24430	J.D.	Great!
24431	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24432	Carla	Happy birthday, Laverne!
24433	Nurse Roberts	Thanks, Carla.
24434	Turk	Did your brother make you face cake?
24435	Nurse Roberts	Sure did!
24436	Carla	Wow.
24437	Turk	Think I could have a piece of that face cake?
24438	Elliot	I heard there's face cake!
24439	Nurse Roberts	Back off!
24440	Turk	Outstanding.
24441	J.D.	Nurse? Do me a favor, please bandage this gentleman up, little bit...fix him up.
24442	J.D.'s Narration	I think they sensed that my first date wasn't going perfectly; and even though I could smell face cake in the air, it was about to get worse.
24443	Danni	Dr. Dorkian, I presume?
24444	J.D.'s Thoughts	The ex-girlfriend from hell.
24445	J.D.	Danni, love to stay and talk, but I'm giving Kylie here a tour of the I.C.U.
24446	Bum	Hey. Hey, hey! You were gonna take me back to the underpass!
24447	J.D.	After the tour! What is it with you and the underpass?
24448	Dr. Cox	She's your nightmare sister. You take her out to dinner.
24449	Jordan	I spent the whole day with her. She stole a sweater!
24450	Danni	So what? You're the one wearing it.
24451	J.D.	Thanks for the shirt, Lonnie.
24452	Lonnie	Are you doing this because I forgot to shave this morning?
24453	J.D.'s Thoughts	Good lord! That's a one-day mustache?
24454	J.D.	No, Lonnie.
24455	J.D.	It's so great, because the residents are practically our slaves.
24456	J.D.'s Thoughts	Aggghhh! I just said "slaves" to my new black girlfriend!
24457	Kylie	Unfreeze, J.D. It's over.
24458	J.D.	Well, let's see. "Fatigue, fever, malaise." Have you been to Hong Kong, sir?
24459	Patient	Yeah...?
24460	J.D.'s Narration	And then I said something stupid.
24461	J.D.	Could be SARS.
24462	J.D.'s Narration	I forgot that if any doctor suspects SARS, it's cause for immediate quarantine lockdown.
24463	Dr. Cox	What have you done, Newbie?
24464	Danni	Quarantinis, anyone?
24465	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24466	Dr. Kelso	Mr. Donaldson hasn't been to Hong Kong in twenty years, so I bet my one remaining testicle no one has SARS.
24467	J.D.	Kylie, angry mob. Angry mob, Kylie.
24468	Danni	SARS sucks.
24469	Dr. Cox	Okay. You can direct any technical questions to my former sister-in-law.
24470	Danni	Hi.
24471	Doug	Hi.
24472	Dr. Cox	Otherwise, let's bear in mind that we are short-handed there are only four doctors here.
24473	Turk	I counted more than that.
24474	Dr. Cox	I'm talking legitimate doctors, turtle head.
24475	Todd	There's only two of us.
24476	Dr. Cox	You are so very useless, I counted you both twice.
24477	Todd	Yeah you did!
24478	J.D.	So be honest is this the worst first date you've ever been on or what?
24479	Kylie	I don't know. I think it's kind of exciting...being in a hospital, getting to see you in action. I just wish I could be your assistant.
24480	J.D.	Say no more. Lonnie, shirt!
24481	Lonnie	No!
24482	J.D.	Don't make me say pants. I'll do it.
24483	J.D.	Still tanning, I see.
24484	Kylie	He's your bitch, isn't he?
24485	J.D.	Yeah.
24486	Kylie	That is so cute! I'll go change.
24487	Elliot	So, Kylie looks like she's having fun.
24488	J.D.	It's a front. She's miserable. So far the highlight of the night's been putting the possum to sleep and that's not a euphemism.
24489	Elliot	J.D., seeing a young doctor do his job is an amazing turn-on for a girl.
24490	Kylie	So what first, doctor?
24491	J.D.	Well, you need a chart.
24492	Kylie	Lonnie! Chart!
24493	J.D.	You look ridiculous.
24494	J.D.'s Thoughts	Except for that glorious mustache.
24495	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24496	Danni	Hey, grouchy pants! Do you wanna hang out?
24497	Dr. Cox	Does "hang out" mean choke you?
24498	Ted	Hey, Danni, what's shakin'?
24499	Ted	Turk and Carla's wedding we made out?
24500	Doug	So did we.
24501	Danni	Was it at the same time? Because I have a habit of doing that at people's weddings.
24502	Dr. Cox	Leaving. Good show, fellas.
24503	Danni	Wait for me, Perr-Perr!
24504	Doug	Smooth maneuver, hoover. You scared her off.
24505	Ted	You were the one who was embarrassingly forward!
24506	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24507	Turk	I'm bored. I'm a surgeon, and there's no surgery.
24508	Carla	Why do you think I brought you in here? We're short-handed. Mr. Dempsey needs his bedsores redressed.
24509	Turk	Baby, that's a nurse stuff, I don't have the expertise.
24510	Carla	Turk, any idiot can be a nurse.
24511	Turk	I know, I just think
24512	Carla	I knew you thought that! I knew it.
24513	Turk	You tricked me!
24514	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24515	Ted	Say she's mine, Murphy!
24516	Doug	Not until you kill me! Aiiee!
24517	Dr. Kelso	The only thing I detest more than treating patients is treating patients on an empty stomach. I'm famished!
24518	Janitor	We've been in here for eight minutes.
24519	Dr. Kelso	I haven't eaten since yesterday.
24520	Janitor	That's an incredibly boring story, with a fantastic......FINISH!
24521	Dr. Kelso	Five bucks says you can't do that twice.
24522	Janitor	You're on.
24523	Janitor	Double or nothin'.
24524	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24525	Elliot	So how's it going with Kylie?
24526	J.D.	There was nothing exciting going on....
24527	Bum	Got twenty bucks?
24528	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24529	Dr. Cox	So, Nurse Ghandirella, I need you to suction this guy, do a wet-to-dry dressing change, and, oh, what the hell, go ahead and top him off with one of your special, special sponge baths happy ending optional, his choice, not yours.
24530	Turk	This guy's in a coma.
24531	Dr. Cox	Not all of him.
24532	Dr. Cox	Not here, not here, not here, not here, not here, not here
24533	Turk	Danni!
24534	Dr. Cox	not he-he-re!
24535	Danni	Hi!
24536	Dr. Cox	Oh, good! You're here!
24537	Danni	Yeah, sure. I'd love to.
24538	Danni	Hey, didn't I go to your wedding?
24539	Turk	Yeah. You threw up on my gram-gram.
24540	Turk	Hey! You can't get inside my head! Hey, mentally? Strong!
24541	Turk	You can't smoke in here.
24542	Danni	I don't see any signs.
24543	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24544	Dr. Kelso	So how much does he owe me, Barbarino?
24545	Todd	Six hundred so far.
24546	Janitor	Dammit, man, you cannot afford this. Stop...stop...stop...!
24547	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24548	J.D.	Come on, Steve! Stay with me, buddy!
24549	Bum	I want more money.
24550	J.D.	WHAT!?
24551	Bum	Fifty bucks or I tell the girl.
24552	J.D.	I don't have it!
24553	Bum	Get it!
24554	J.D.	Elliot, I need another doctor over here, stat!
24555	Elliot	Yeah?
24556	J.D.	Gimme thirty dollars.
24557	Elliot	I gave you twenty, I'm tapped!
24558	J.D.	I need a dermatologist over here, stat!
24559	Dr. Johnson	Oh yeah! Time to shine!
24560	J.D.	Look, I paid this guy to fake a heart attack. He wants fifty bucks, we only have twenty.
24561	Dr. Johnson	You know, I feel like you guys just use me for my money.
24562	J.D.	You have a trust fund! Now gimme the money!
24563	Dr. Johnson	Ehhh!
24564	J.D.	CLEAR!
24565	Bum	I'm alive!
24566	J.D.	J.D., one Lord, zero.
24567	J.D.'s Narration	Just like that, love was in the air. It was as if our first date got other people talking about some of theirs.
24568	Elliot	I had this one first date where the guy took me to play paintball. All he does the whole time is shoot me in the face. After two years with that guy, I'm like, "That's enough!" You know?
24569	Janitor	Ha ha! First dates, huh?
24570	Todd	I went out with this girl, she was like the worst first date ever. I take her for a romantic ferry ride, and for some reason I decide to take it out
24571	Carla	Okay. Your turn is done.
24572	Turk	Yeah...you know what? Really don't wanna hear about this one. Okay!
24573	Dr. Cox	...And she didn't like the pizza I ordered because it had anchovies on it. You believe that?
24574	Carla	It had anchovies.
24575	Dr. Cox	And pineapples.
24576	Carla	And pineapples?
24577	Dr. Cox	And red peppers.
24578	Carla	And green peppers.
24579	Turk	Ohhh.
24580	Carla	Wait red peppers!
24581	Turk	NOOOOOOOOOOOO!
24582	J.D.'s Narration	I could hear the pain in my best friend's voice, and I could feel how little I cared...because by the way Kylie was looking at me, I knew she thought I was sexy.
24583	Kylie	You know something? Seeing you in your element today, you seem so...
24584	J.D.'s Thoughts	Here it comes sexy!
24585	Kylie	Genuine.
24586	J.D.'s Thoughts	She would have said sexy if I had a mustache.
24587	Kylie	You know, James lied all the time, and I don't know...it's just nice to be with a guy I can trust.
24588	J.D.	Cool.
24589	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, no.
24590	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24591	J.D.	I don't deserve this....
24592	Elliot	So, you just tell her the truth, she's mad at you for a little while, and then she forgives ya.
24593	J.D.	I see what you're saying! There's no downside! Kylie!
24594	Turk	You dated the devil.
24595	Carla	Turk.
24596	Turk	And you lied to me.
24597	Carla	No, uh-uh! No. You never asked me if I dated Dr. Cox. You can ask me anything, I would never lie to you.
24598	Turk	Do you sometimes wish I had hair?
24599	Carla	Yes.
24600	Turk	This is a nightmare. I'm standing here living in a nightmare.
24601	Carla	Okay, maybe I'm guilty of a lie of omission.
24602	Turk	'Cause you're a lie omitter!
24603	Carla	I know this may be asking too much, but could you please try and keep it together until we can get home and talk about it?
24604	Turk	Fine.
24605	Carla	Thank you.
24606	Lonnie	Carla, I like your hair that way.
24607	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24608	Dr. Kelso	Laverne, I bet you're tempted to break open that face cake and just tear it apart.
24609	Nurse Roberts	No one's touching this.
24610	Dr. Kelso	Oh, I don't care. I'm not even hungry.
24611	Janitor	Dr. Kelso, I don't have seven hundred dollars....
24612	Janitor	That actually sounded like the word "cake."
24613	Dr. Kelso	You get me that damn face cake, and you are free and clear.
24614	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24615	Danni	Hi, Glenn.
24616	&	Hey!
24617	Doug	I'm Glenn.
24618	Ted	I'm Glenn!
24619	Ted	Look, let's not go down that road again. Come on. Shake.
24620	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24621	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, it's time to come clean.
24622	J.D.	Kylie, I brought you here because I wanted to tell you
24623	Doug	Say I'm Glenn!
24624	J.D.	...That's peculiar...
24625	Danni	J.D.! J.D.! Look at me!
24626	Kylie	Ugh! That's exactly the kind of girl my ex-boyfriend would have dated.
24627	J.D.	I barely know her.
24628	J.D.'s Thoughts	And the lies begin again.
24629	J.D.	I certainly would never sleep with her.
24630	J.D.'s Thoughts	That's it you're stronger than this. Not another lie!
24631	J.D.	I race motorcycles.
24632	J.D.	Excuse me.
24633	J.D.	What the hell are you doing?
24634	Bum	I need more cash.
24635	J.D.	For what?
24636	Bum	I'm puttin' DSL in my box.
24637	J.D.	Fine! But know this: you've been nothing but a disappointment to me since the moment I ran over you.
24638	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24639	Dr. Cox	Hey, baby.
24640	Carla	Keep it together.
24641	Dr. Cox	Do you remember that quarantine we had seven years ago? It was just you and me, all alone late at night here in the I.C.U.?
24642	Turk	That's it.
24643	Carla	Turk!
24644	Dr. Cox	Come on. If he wasn't such a jealous baby, it wouldn't be such a big deal.
24645	Carla	Give him a break! What if you found out Jordan had a history with somebody here?
24646	Dr. Cox	Oh, fair enough.
24647	Dr. Cox	In the brief eighteen months that Jordan and I weren't together, how many of you had your way with her?
24648	Dr. Cox	Bear in mind, I'm gonna need absolute honesty here or I will brain you.
24649	Dr. Cox	Anyway, whoever taught Jordan that reverse cowgirl position...it's long overdue, but thank you.
24650	Dr. Mickhead	You're welcome.
24651	Carla	You're a freak.
24652	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24653	Nurse Roberts	Who ate my face cake?!
24654	Dr. Kelso	He did.
24655	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24656	Elliot	Wow, he is really out.
24657	J.D.	A mild sedative fell into his juice box.
24658	Elliot	Look, J.D...I know why you're lying about everything. You don't think you're good enough for Kylie. I mean, you've always had this insecure thing even though you're this funny, weird, amazing guy. I mean...that's why I fell in love with you, and I'm betting if you just act like yourself, Kylie will too.
24659	J.D.	Thanks, Elliot. Really.
24660	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24661	Elliot	No, it's not.
24662	J.D.	What do you call that bra you wore for your date last week?
24663	Elliot	Oh, the Miracle Lift Super Push-Up bra?
24664	J.D.	Carla, when you first started dating Turk, didn't you tell him you loved watching NBA basketball every weekend?
24665	Carla	Yeah.
24666	J.D.	And how many games have you watched since he proposed?
24667	Carla	One. But only because that time he made me choose between watching basketball or having sex.
24668	Elliot	Ah...heh.
24669	J.D.	Exactly.
24670	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24671	Turk	I don't understand why Carla didn't tell me about you guys.
24672	Dr. Cox	Maybe it's because she's really in love with me, and together we injected you with diabetes to very slowly get you out of the picture.
24673	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24674	J.D.'s Narration	They say all horrible things eventually come to an end.
24675	Dr. Kelso	The lab results are back, and there is no SARS. The quarantine is over. So, bye-bye, everyone.
24676	Nurse Roberts	That looks like my neck!
24677	Nurse Roberts	Oh, this does not end well for you.
24678	Dr. Kelso	You are going to pay every cent of that seven hundred dollars!
24679	Janitor	Double or nothin'!
24680	Janitor	We're even. Good night, sir.
24681	J.D.'s Narration	Dr. Kelso made me realize that lies come back to haunt you even little ones about cake.
24682	J.D.'s Narration	Heck, even a lie of omission shook the foundation of a couple that was much more established than Kylie and me.
24683	J.D.'s Narration	And I knew I couldn't let her go out that door.
24684	Kylie	Let's go.
24685	J.D.	Kylie, wait.
24686	Kylie	Is there anything else?
24687	Danni	Adios, assface.
24688	J.D.	I had sex with her. A lot.
24689	Kylie	Why are you telling me this?
24690	J.D.	If I don't come clean now, whether it's a few weeks or months or years from now, I know it's gonna come back to haunt me and ruin us, and I don't want that.
24691	Kylie	I'm not looking for a project.
24692	J.D.	Yeah.... I understand. It's....
24693	Kylie	So get it together.
24694	J.D.	Wait. You know, if we if we leave like that, that's how we're always gonna remember this night. I don't want that.
24695	Kylie	So...what do you want to do?
24696	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24697	J.D.'s Narration	Things were amazing with Kylie. But before I could get more emotionally invested, I needed answers to some questions that were very important to me.
24698	J.D.	Name three spin-offs of the sitcom 'Happy Days'.
24699	Kylie	'Mork & Mindy', 'Laverne & Shirley', and 'Joanie Loves Chachi'.
24700	Turk	You marry her. You marry her now! You marry her!
24701	J.D.	Okay, okay, we passed Section One "Sitcoms about or involving Asian-American diner owners." Now on to Section Two "Fat, tubby T.V. husbands and the crazy-hot women that would never actually be married to them."
24702	Carla	Hey, we're missing 'Sanford and Son'!
24703	Turk	What!?
24704	Carla	Yes!
24705	J.D.'s Narration	Turk was freaked out because Carla never joins us on 'Sanford and Son' night. Or 'Cheers' night. I think it was because she was feeling a little romantically competitive with Kylie and me.
24706	Turk	Woman! Woman!
24707	Carla	Hm?
24708	Turk	I am not a lollipop!
24709	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24710	J.D.'s Narration	Carla certainly tried to be as adorable as us...
24711	J.D.	Uh! Darn it! You won!
24712	J.D.'s Narration	...unfortunately, Turk wasn't on the same wavelength.
24713	Turk	AHHH! DO YOU SEE WHAT YOU GET, CARLA!? DO YOU SEE WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU MESS WITH THE WARRIOR!?!
24714	J.D.	YES! Ten to nine!
24715	Kylie	Hi.
24716	J.D.	Hi.
24717	Kylie	Bye.
24718	J.D.	Bye.
24719	J.D.	Ahh. Kylie's in class all day and she bartends at night, and I'm still working sixteen-hour shifts, so we try to make sure we kiss at least once a day. Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, she takes a cab over here; Tuesdays and Thursdays, I scooter to my baby!
24720	Turk	Honey. I haven't foofied in bed in like a week!
24721	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24722	Newscaster	With twenty-seven deaths so far, this strain of E. coli from tainted meat is quite serious. So if you're a big meat-eater, be careful!
24723	J.D.'s Narration	The reason we were upset was that every time the media reports on some weird health crisis, everyone who sees it thinks they have it.
24724	Elliot	Oh, it's not so bad. It's only a few people here.
24725	Elliot	OKAY, OKAY! EVERYBODY JUST SHUT UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP!
24726	Elliot	Ahem. Thank you. Now, who's first?
24727	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, there's always one positive when something like this happens.
24728	J.D.	WOOOOOOOOOO! WOOOOOOOOOHOOHOOHOOOO! I LOVE MEDICINE!
24729	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24730	Elliot	Uh, Dr. Cox! We are having a bit of a crisis here.
24731	Dr. Cox	I see that. It seems you two have worn the same outfit.
24732	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24733	Dr. Cox	Barbie, if it's of any consolation, it looks slightly better on you.
24734	Elliot	No, I'm talking about Thank you.
24735	Dr. Cox	Sure.
24736	J.D.	What the hell are we supposed to do?
24737	Dr. Cox	Loretta, relax, I've been involved in every ridiculous T.V.-induced panic there is. Poison pills, SARS, West Nile, North Face, South Fork, East River, monkeypox, pop rocks, toilet snakes, mad cow, bird flu, swine flu, and, quite frankly, every other flu that you could really only catch if you're actually fornicating with the animal it's named for.
24738	And as a parting gift, I will tell you this	Narrow it down to two symptoms vomiting and diarrhea. Because it's just not E. coli unless it's firing out both exits.
24739	J.D.	I sure hope I don't have dog flu.
24740	J.D.	Well, Mr. Bernstein, do you have vomiting and diarrhea?
24741	Mr. Bernstein	No.
24742	Woman	No.
24743	Man	No.
24744	Woman 2	No.
24745	Man 2	No!
24746	Woman 3	No.
24747	Mr. James	No.
24748	J.D.	Okay, then, Mr. James, you're free Wait a second, Charles James? I was watching the 'Cheers' DVD the other night are you Charles James the writer?
24749	Mr. James	Yeah, that's me.
24750	J.D.'s Thoughts	Just. Stay. Calm.
24751	J.D.	Uh, Elliot, I need to take this gentleman upstairs for some more, uh, tests.
24752	Elliot	J.D., don't leave me here.
24753	J.D.	This is very important! He may even need a surgical consult.
24754	&	Nooooorrm!
24755	Mr. James	Yeah, I get it.
24756	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24757	Carla	Whoa-ho! What are you doing? No tongue before ten.
24758	Turk	Baby, J.D. and Kylie can make time for that stupid appointment kiss once a day we should be able to do it twice a day!
24759	Carla	Love is not a competition.
24760	Turk	Okay.
24761	Carla	Make it three times.
24762	Turk	All right, bet. See you at noon?
24763	Carla	Noon.
24764	Dr. Kelso	You youngsters. If there is one thing I have learned, it's that you can't schedule love.
24765	Dr. Cox	I think your credit card statement would beg to differ.
24766	Dr. Kelso	Okay, listen up, everyone. For budgetary reasons, we are turning the bathrooms on even-numbered floors into patients rooms. To sum up, floors two and four are no longer for one or two.
24767	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24768	Carla	Well?
24769	Dr. Cox	I'm sorry, would you please repeat the question?
24770	Carla	Are you just gonna roll over like that?
24771	Jordan	That's weird, I asked him the same thing last night.
24772	Carla	Where's the outrage? The anger? The hate?
24773	Jordan	Again, last night!
24774	Carla	You've gone soft.
24775	Jordan	Okay, now it's getting spooky.
24776	Carla	Look, you're the only one who can stand up to Kelso.
24777	Dr. Cox	Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to present Man Not Caring.
24778	Carla	Okay, Jordan, little help.
24779	Jordan	If you don't do what she wants, I'm going to stop having sex with you and start making love...to you.
24780	Dr. Cox	Where is that bastard?! KELSO!
24781	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24782	Turk	My wife's name's Carla.
24783	J.D.	Yeah!
24784	Turk	Yeah! Like Carla from the show.
24785	J.D.	Just like it.
24786	Mr. James	Wow.... I've never actually met anyone who had the same name as a character on the show.
24787	J.D. & Turk	Really?
24788	Mr. James	No.
24789	J.D.	Oh, well, that's understandable
24790	Turk	Yeah.
24791	J.D.	I mean, there's a lot of Sams....
24792	Turk	There's probably a lot of Carlas
24793	Elliot	Excuse me, J.D.! Ahem. I just spent the last three hours interviewing two hundred and twelve hypochondriacs half of whom don't speak any English! Do you have any idea how embarrassing it is to mime "diarrhea"!?
24794	J.D.	Talk about your Dianes!
24795	Turk	Oh, damn! It's kiss time!
24796	Carla	Ooh!
24797	Turk	Ahh. Baby.
24798	Turk	Baby!
24799	Turk	Come here, girl! Right here! That's where I want it! I want it right there!
24800	Turk & Carla	Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah!
24801	Carla	Where've you been?
24802	Turk	I was up at the Nurses' Station!
24803	Carla	I was looking all over for you!
24804	Turk	We
24805	Turk & Carla	Gotta go.
24806	Dr. Cox	Bob. Bob.
24807	Dr. Cox	Sorry, Madge.
24808	Dr. Kelso	What do you want, Perry?
24809	Dr. Cox	Bob, enough of the stinking budget cuts, already!
24810	Dr. Kelso	Noted. Now, if you will excuse me, I have to fire someone.
24811	Dr. Cox	Oh, baloney, old man!
24812	Dr. Kelso	I have to cut twenty-seven thousand dollars from the cafeteria budget! And my idea of getting it all back by charging a hundred bucks for a piece of cake went right out the window when Fat Frank decided to go on that power diet!
24813	Fat Frank	I lost over two hundred-thirty pounds so far!
24814	Dr. Kelso	I don't know why he keeps wearing those pants.
24815	Dr. Cox	All right, fair enough. Now I got your little budget reports! You don't know who to fire, do you!
24816	Dr. Kelso	Fine. Keep 'em. You do it!
24817	Dr. Cox	Watch and learn. I'll do it, and I'll do it without firing a single person.
24818	Dr. Cox	I have to fire someone.
24819	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24820	Elliot	I can't believe you left me all alone for a stupid T.V. writer.
24821	J.D.	Oh, like that is any different from the time you spent all night hanging out with your favorite weatherman from channel 4!
24822	Elliot	The man had a massive heart attack! I was nothing but professional!
24823	Elliot	Okay, he's stable! Take the picture, Carla!
24824	J.D.	What do you want me to do?
24825	Elliot	I want you to go in there and tell Mr. James that there's absolutely no reason for him to be up here.
24826	J.D.	Mr. James, how long have you had that cough?
24827	Mr. James	Oh, a couple of months now.
24828	J.D.	Am I wrong, Elliot, or is that the kind of cough that needs a chest x-ray?
24829	Elliot	Probably.
24830	J.D.	Thank you.
24831	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24832	Figsack	Hey, yo, Turk.
24833	Turk	What's up?
24834	Figsack	I got a break. You wanna play some ball?
24835	Turk	Definitely.
24836	Turk	Baby. Yeah, I'm not gonna be able to make our next appointment kiss.
24837	Carla	I'm swamped, too. Yeah, right now I'm helping Dr. Schwartz reset a patient's leg. Oh, I think you got it, Dr. Schwartz.
24838	Carla	You're a liar!
24839	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24840	Jordan	Oh, for God's sake, Perry! Adjust your bra, man up, and fire the one with the least pathetic story!
24841	Dr. Cox	Do you really think I know any of these people's stories?
24842	Janitor	Well, let me fill you in. First we have Hank four kids, trying to make it on a dishwasher's salary. Next one is Mike lost half his leg in a motorcycle accident. And then there's Judy been here thirty years, just two away from retirement.
24843	Jordan	You're...you're friends with all these people?
24844	Janitor	You kidding me? I read their files. I read everybody's files, Ms. Manic-Depressive, Dr. Drinks A Lot.
24845	Dr. Cox	Hold your horses. Just tell me who the last person hired was, would you please?
24846	Kenny	Looks like you folks could use a little refresher! Serving people like you who save lives every day, makes me happier than a kitten chasing a leaky cow! God bless ya! God bless ya.
24847	Dr. Cox	I have to fire Opie, don't I.
24848	Jordan	You think?
24849	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24850	Elliot	Metastatic lung cancer? How was he even walking around with this?
24851	J.D.	At worst I thought maybe he had a bad case of bronchitis.
24852	Elliot	This is gonna suck.
24853	Mr. James	Why'd they move me up here?
24854	J.D.	Uh, Mr. James, I'm not quite sure how to say this, but...you have lung cancer...
24855	J.D.'s Narration	It was strange telling Mr. James he may only have a few weeks to live when just a few short hours ago we all thought he was fine.
24856	J.D.'s Narration	...or realizing your relationship may not be as stable as you thought...
24857	Carla	We couldn't even make it one day.
24858	J.D.'s Narration	...or having to do someone else's dirty work for them...
24859	Dr. Cox	Say, Kenny? Can I talk to you for a second?
24860	J.D.'s Narration	...there are moments when we all wish life was more like a sitcom.
24861	Elliot	I'm so sorry.
24862	J.D.	I'm sorry, too, sir.
24863	Mr. James	Well, the good news is I won't have to eat my wife's cooking anymore, right!
24864	J.D.'s Thoughts	J.D.'s sitcom fantasy will be back after these messages!
24865	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24866	J.D.'s Thoughts	J.D.'s sitcom fantasy is filmed in front of a live studio audience.
24867	Mr. James	It's weird, there's just so many things I never got to do in my life...like go to a carnival or take a ride in a hot-air balloon.
24868	Elliot	We can do all that! We are gonna give you the best day ever!
24869	J.D.	Elliot, a word!
24870	J.D.	A hot-air balloon seems kind of dangerous, I mean, he could get hurt.
24871	Elliot	What's he gonna do? Bruise one of his giant malignant tumors?
24872	J.D.	Safety is always important, Elliot.
24873	Elliot	Oh, my God. You're afraid of balloon rides, aren't you!
24874	J.D.	It's floating wicker propelled by fire!
24875	J.D.	Besides, I defy you to find one other thing that I'm afraid of!
24876	Janitor	Mopping time! Mopping time! It's mopping time!
24877	Janitor	Yes, it's mopping time, my friend! And as you know, I always like to start in the exact spot you're standing. Let's get to work.
24878	Janitor	Here we go.
24879	J.D.	Is that my new sweater?!
24880	Janitor	No, this is my new sweater mop.
24881	J.D.	It went dynamite with my beige cords!
24882	Janitor	You mean my beige cord sponge?
24883	Kenny	You You wanted to see me?
24884	Dr. Cox	Hell yeah, I wanted to see you. I wanted to tell you that I...I think you're doing a great job. Boy, that meatloaf today, it was it was virtually hairless.
24885	Kenny	I took off the gloves and...it makes the hair a lot easier to...pick out.
24886	Dr. Cox	Get outta here.
24887	Dr. Kelso	Perry? Why the hell is he still here? When I go back down to the cafeteria, there had better be only three workers there! Unless Margaret spits out another kid that woman's like a Catholic bunny.
24888	Dr. Kelso	Get it done!
24889	Dr. Cox	Why? Why am I having such a hard time with this?
24890	Jordan	Because apparently you have girl parts!
24891	Dr. Cox	Kelso said that if we can cover his salary in the budget, that Kenny can stay! But where are we gonna come up twenty-six thousand, three-hundred and seventy-two dollars?
24892	Dr. Cox	You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
24893	Jordan	Yeah! That that ohhhh! That we invite Muscles, here, to hang a banner in our bedroom that says "It takes three to party"?
24894	Dr. Cox	All right , knuckleheads! I need one of you to win this talent show!
24895	Elliot	I can do Shakespeare in German!
24896	Elliot	In college I double majored in theatre and classic languages.
24897	J.D.	Does that degree come with headgear and allergies?
24898	Dr. Cox	Let's take a look at our other options. Gandhi? You appear to be a man that is utterly without talent. Unless, of course, you wanna count the fact that you are the twentieth-best basketball player in a predominately white hospital?
24899	Dr. Cox	Jordan, your only skill is illegal in twenty-six states.
24900	Jordan	It's twenty-seven. Arkansas buckled.
24901	Dr. Cox	Carla, that makes you my girl. Hell, we could crank up the humidity and watch your hair explode, that'd be terrific.
24902	Dr. Cox	Which leaves me, and, unless all of you wanna see me turn a two-syllable word into a six-syllable word, I re-he-he-he-he-heally think that we should keep looking.
24903	J.D.	You know what, save your breath! I'm about to get in a hot-air balloon and get Evil Knievel on my own ass!
24904	J.D.	Come on, Elliot! Let's go French kiss the sun!
24905	Carla	You know, you're wrong about Turk he has many, many talents. Yeah, he's really good at not finding five seconds to kiss his wife.
24906	Turk	Wow! That's interesting, because you're really good at that, too!
24907	Carla	Oh, really?
24908	Turk	Really.
24909	Carla	Really?
24910	Turk	Really!
24911	Carla	Because at least I can remember how long we been married or what our song is!
24912	Turk	I don't know the name of it, but I know it goes like this!
24913	Carla	Are you humming the "let's all go to the movies" song?
24914	Turk	Is that not our song?
24915	Carla	It's sung by hot dogs!
24916	Mr. James	What an amazing day! A balloon ride! Lunch by the beach! And my first carnival!
24917	Elliot	Yeah. Sorry you missed out on getting your face painted.
24918	Mr. James	Well, they only had time to paint one more face, so I let the kid behind me go, make him stop crying.
24919	J.D.	That was awesome!
24920	Dr. Cox	Spidergirl.
24921	Dr. Cox	All right, talent show's about to start.
24922	Mr. James	Talent show? I'd love to see it, but I'm too tired to get out of bed.
24923	J.D.	That sucks for you!
24924	J.D.	I'm just kidding! We're gonna do it right here!
24925	Elliot	Oh, Romeo, Romeo, Warum bist du Romeo? Verleugne deinen Vater und entsage deinem Namen. Oder wenn du das nicht willst, so SCHWÖRE hier...
24926	Carla	Gesundheit.
24927	Janitor	Hey, I'm wondering, what's the story with steel wool? I mean, is it steel or is it wool?
24928	Janitor	Make up your mind, steel wool. Are there iron sheep hopping around in Scotland?
24929	Janitor	Oh, brother. Look, I, uh...either start laughing or I start unplugging your machines.
24930	J.D.	And if any of you cows, goats, or ducks have any questions, don't be afraid to ask me! I'm just like all of you, only giant and human!
24931	J.D.	Thank you. I hope you enjoyed our production of World's Most Giant Doctor Goes to the Farm.
24932	Turk	So what did we end up going with?
24933	Turk	Ah! You went with the farm idea!
24934	Dr. Cox	Oh my God, we're doomed.
24935	Dr. Kelso	Okay, Perry! That's it, it's over. The only act left to see is you firing that guy.
24936	Jordan	Wait, wait, wait! There's one more contestant!
24937	Dr. Cox	Oh, no. Is that Kenny?
24938	Kenny	Hi, I'm Kenny.
24939	Jordan	Yeah it is.
24940	Kenny	Isn't she lovely? Isn't she wonderful? Isn't she precious? Less than one minute old...
24941	Carla	Hey, that that's our song!
24942	Turk	Yeah, I know, I told him to sing it.
24943	Kenny	...Isn't she lovely, made from love!
24944	Dr. Cox	All right now, Bobbo, you give it to him. You know he deserves it.
24945	Dr. Kelso	The winner!
24946	Dr. Cox	Atta boy!
24947	Carla	Uh, Turk and I are gonna go home and spend some time together. Some GOOD TIME!
24948	Turk	And by "good time" she means bumping uglies!
24949	J.D.	Well, I hope you had a good day, Mr. James!
24950	Elliot	Wait a second! This chart isn't for Charles James, it's for James Charles! He's the one who has cancer, not you!
24951	J.D.	And who cares about him! He's anti-Semitic!
24952	Mr. James	Well, that's a load off my mind!
24953	J.D.	Hey everybody!
24954	J.D.	Thanks for coming so quickly.
24955	J.D.	You know, this is the kind of thing I normally say out loud in my head, but since we're all here...
24956	J.D.	It just seems like, in the end, everything always works out. Because as long as we
24957	Elliot	Mr. James? Mr. James, can you hear me?
24958	J.D.	Wait, this isn't right.
24959	Elliot	We're gonna intubate!
24960	Elliot	dopamine! Wide open! I need an ET tube. Where's anesthesia?
24961	J.D.'s Narration	Unfortunately, around here things don't always end as neat and tidy as they do in sitcoms.
24962	J.D.'s Narration	Relationships aren't always magically fixed in thirty minutes you have to work on them.
24963	J.D.'s Narration	Problems don't always have easy solutions.
24964	Dr. Cox	Hey, Kenny, once again I'm...I'm real sorry.
24965	Dr. Kelso	Welcome to my world. Now, imagine going home to my wife.
24966	J.D.'s Narration	And around here, nice people don't always get better.
24967	J.D.'s Narration	And at times like that, it's comforting to know there's always one thing that can pick your spirits up.
24968	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24969	J.D.'s Narration	Kylie wanted to take things slowly. So, seventeen dates in, I was basically embroiled in the world's longest make-out session.
24970	Kylie	Too much kissing?
24971	J.D.	No, no. Come on, I still have a little saliva left.
24972	J.D.'s Narration	As I felt the onslaught of what can only be described as a vicious tongue cramp, I decided it was time to let Kylie see my favorite dance. The "For God's sake, invite me to stay over" dance.
24973	J.D.'s Thoughts	The dance begins with a subtle hint.
24974	J.D.	I am so pooped.
24975	J.D.'s Thoughts	Step Two: Sashay her into sympathy.
24976	J.D.	It's chilly out there.
24977	Kylie	It is cold.
24978	J.D.'s Thoughts	Finally, sweep her off her feet with your vulnerable cuteness.
24979	J.D.	You know what I call this weather? Snuggle weather.
24980	J.D.'s Thoughts	Tip the band leader and fluff up the pillows, because this dance is done.
24981	Kylie	You should go.
24982	Teddy Bear	Yeah, hit the bricks, bitch. You got no game! Ha ha ha ha ha!
24983	J.D.'s Narration	I wasn't the only one having relationship trouble.
24984	Lately, Turk and Carla had lost their sizzle. And as a couple, when you reach a roadblock, you can do one of two things	Look inward and try and solve your problems together...or blame someone else.
24985	Carla	You have to move out.
24986	J.D.	What? Is this about the bra catapult thing? Because if it's that big a deal, I can throw my own water balloons. I don't need those C-cups.
24987	Carla	J.D.! We're newlyweds! That's hard enough, and when you're around Tell him, Turk.
24988	Turk	You're all up in our space!
24989	J.D.	What? When have I ever been all up in your space?
24990	Carla	This is nice.
24991	Turk	Mm-hmm.
24992	J.D.	Whooooo! Sorry about the twosie, guys.
24993	J.D.	Huh. And here I thought that was a lovely evening.
24994	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
24995	Dr. Cox	Guys, guys, guys. You've all been working here for two years. Now why do I have to keep teaching you the same stuff?
24996	Lonnie	Can we take a break? The sun is scorching, and I'm very fair-skinned.
24997	Dr. Cox	You've only been out here for eight minutes.
24998	Lonnie	Whatever.
24999	Jordan	Ah, the intern car wash. Are you saving up so you can finally get those pec implants replaced?
25000	Dr. Cox	Ron is coming to town today
25001	Jordan	Mm.
25002	Dr. Cox	Speaking of which, I need to see you put on something a bit nicer.
25003	Jordan	You know, this whole competition thing that you have happening with your high school buddy, it is very, very boring. You know, like you were the homecoming king, he was the prom king. You went to medical school, he went to business school. You got divorced, he got divorced.
25004	Dr. Cox	Yeah, but he never has to see his wife anymore, so technically he's got me beat on that one.
25005	Jordan	Eh.
25006	Dr. Cox	Look, I am not going to let this weekend become about who's a bigger man. Ron's bringing his kid I can't wait to meet the child. And when he pulls in here in his crappy rent-a-car and he gets one look at my hand-polished Porsche, well, naturally, I'll have the lead.
25007	Jordan	Very exciting.
25008	Ron	Hoo-hoo! Hey. Hey, guys. Oh, I know the chopper seems like a bit much, but, uh, there was crazy traffic, so I'm having my assistant drive my rental car over from the airport ah!
25009	Ron	Well, it hardly seems worth it now, but what the hell? Ha! So, Perr, what are you driving these days?
25010	Ron	Well, that ol' girl needs a wash.
25011	Dr. Cox	Thank you, Ron.
25012	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
25013	Elliot	I can't believe Turk and Carla are kicking me out.
25014	Elliot	Mm. When I was fifteen, my parents threatened to do the same thing, so I called them on it.
25015	J.D.	They let you stay?
25016	Elliot	Nope. I lived with the Babcocks for two years.
25017	J.D.	Oh.
25018	J.D.'s Thoughts	All right, Carla calls the shots. Appeal to her rational side.
25019	J.D.	Carla, I totally understand you guys need your space, but with work and my financial situation, finding a new place is gonna be, minimum, two to four years.
25020	Carla	Come on, Bambi. Aren't there any other married couples that want to live in a small apartment with a 29-year-old man?
25021	J.D.'s Thoughts	She called me a man!
25022	J.D.	Turk, I've always had your back and you always had mine. Are you sure you want to go through with this?
25023	Turk	It was my idea.
25024	J.D.	I banged your first girlfriend.
25025	Turk	Chantal?
25026	J.D.	Now, look, I need a favor. Let me try it. I'll move out for a week; if you still like it, I'll move out for good.
25027	&	Agreed
25028	J.D.	All right. And d-d-d-don't worry about John Dorian, because I may be poor in pocket, but I'm rich in friends!
25029	Elliot	Nope.
25030	J.D.'s Thoughts	That's okay, because when God closes a window, he opens a door.
25031	Kylie	I'm just not sure I'm comfortable with you sleeping here.
25032	J.D.	Kylie, I hear you. But trust me, this week is not gonna be about sex. Even though I think we both agree that's where we'd eventually like our relationship to end up, right?
25033	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
25034	Ron	It's good to see you, buddy.
25035	Dr. Cox	It is great to see you, I'll tell you that!
25036	Ron	Looks like we got ourselves in a little walking hug here. What say we, uh
25037	Dr. Cox	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
25038	Ron	So look at you, Mr. Big Time Doctor!
25039	Dr. Cox	How about you, Mr. Big Time...I don't actually know what you do.
25040	Ron	Man, I've told you a hundred times: I run mergers and acquisitions for a large private equity hedge fund.
25041	Dr. Cox	No, no. You do hedge clippings for a big farm.
25042	Ron	Wha?
25043	Dr. Cox	You privately acquire hedgehogs.
25044	Ron	You know what, your crush on my mom was cute when we were fourteen, but the woman's 85 now. You need to back off. Or we can ask her out to dinner. I'll have her pop in her "going out" teeth and you two can see if there's any real spark.
25045	Ron	Jordan.
25046	Jordan	Hi.
25047	Ron	Will you be joining us for dinner?
25048	Jordan	No way. Every time we go out, the whole night turns into a giant pissing contest.
25049	Dr. Cox	No, it doesn't.
25050	Dr. Cox	First one who tags the dog wins.
25051	Ron	Count it.
25052	Dr. Cox	You know, I've seen that dog around the neighborhood. I think we killed its spirit.
25053	Ron	Yeah.
25054	Dr. Cox	Look, why don't you bring Nathan over to our place tonight? The kids can play, and we can forget all about this competition crap.
25055	Ron	I'd like that.
25056	Dr. Cox	So would I.
25057	Dr. Cox	Jack is going to kick Nathan's ass at playing!
25058	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
25059	Carla	Woo! How great is it not having J.D. around, huh?
25060	Turk	Ha! So great. So great.... Now what?
25061	Carla	Well, let's see. Did it on the couch.
25062	Turk	Uh-huh.
25063	Carla	Did it in the kitchen.
25064	Turk	Oh, yes, we did.
25065	Carla	Wanna do it on J.D.'s bed?
25066	Turk	I think it's about time someone did.
25067	Turk	You don't really want to have more sex, do you?
25068	Carla	God, no, I didn't even want to do it in the kitchen.
25069	Turk	Whenever J.D. and I are bored, we like to play a little game called "toe or finger"?
25070	Carla	Uh-huh?
25071	Turk	You close your eyes, and I run either a toe or finger underneath your nose and try to guess which one it is! Huh!?
25072	Carla	Usually when J.D. gets off work, we gossip about hospital stuff.
25073	Turk	Baby, that sounds a little immature.
25074	Carla	Okay! Then, you know, what the hell are we supposed to do?
25075	Elliot	Hi, guys! Thanks for inviting me over!
25076	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
25077	J.D.	Thanks for letting us crash here, man.
25078	Todd	The Todd's not accustomed to receiving gentleman callers.
25079	J.D.	Okay....
25080	Todd	Oh, I don't swim.
25081	J.D.	Oh, I don't I don't have one of those, Todd.
25082	Todd	No problem.
25083	J.D.	Extra-medium.
25084	Todd	This'll work. And it'll look good, too.
25085	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
25086	Dr. Cox	All right, Jack, listen to me. Ron's in the bathroom diapering his kid. When he gets out, it's playtime.
25087	Ron	27-second diaper change.
25088	Dr. Cox	I can change a diaper in twenty seconds.
25089	Jordan	Oh, my God!
25090	Dr. Cox	Say, Ronnie, what say we let the kids play for a while?
25091	Ron	You know, uh, Nathan is actually in the 90th percentile in height.
25092	Dr. Cox	Jack's only in the 85th.
25093	Ron	Aw.
25094	Dr. Cox	Of course, he's in the 99th for head size.
25095	Ron	Congratulations. Your son's the Hamburgler.
25096	Dr. Cox	Head size is directly related to intelligence.
25097	Ron	Really?
25098	Dr. Cox	Oh....
25099	Carla	Oh! And Laverne told me that Nurse Tisdale is sleeping with that married albino radiologist.
25100	Elliot	Oh, I feel so bad for his wife.
25101	Carla	Elliot! It's not about empathy, it's about judging people.
25102	Elliot	Can't we do something else?
25103	Turk	Okay, you know what, I vote Elliot goes home! Because she's all up in our space, honey! She's in our space!
25104	Elliot	Oh, why? Because I don't want to dish about other people behind their backs or smell your toe?
25105	Turk	Or finger!
25106	Elliot	All I've seen so far is the toe, Turk!
25107	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
25108	Jordan	See you tomorrow, guys!
25109	Jordan	Look, Perry, we just have to accept Jack the way he is, love him unconditionally, and enroll him in some sort of block-building class.
25110	Dr. Cox	Look at these things, Jordan.
25111	Jordan	Yeah?
25112	Dr. Cox	The color coordination, the the symmetry. A two-year-old shouldn't be able to do this kind of stuff.
25113	Jordan	What are you trying to say?
25114	J.D.'s Narration	They say just admitting there's a problem is half the battle...
25115	J.D.'s Narration	...even if it's something you didn't expect...
25116	Elliot	What is wrong with you guys?
25117	Carla	We miss J.D.
25118	J.D.'s Narration	The bottom line is, when the warning signs are right in front of you, there's no denying the truth.
25119	Dr. Cox	Nathan has classic signs of Autism.
25120	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
25121	Dr. Cox	Ron's kid doesn't make eye contact, he barely speaks, and he freaked out when you tried to cuddle him. I mean, hell, if he was an adult, he'd be, well...you know...me. But those behaviors in a child could point towards Autism. I think it's pretty obvious what we have to do.
25122	Jordan	Grit our teeth, get through the weekend, never speak to Ron again?
25123	Dr. Cox	Exactly.
25124	Jordan	Mm-hmm.
25125	Elliot	I cannot believe what I just heard!
25126	Dr. Cox	The tick-tocking of your biological clock leading you towards the corner of Celibate and Spinster Way?
25127	Jordan	Sometimes it's great to already have a bastard child.
25128	Dr. Cox	You said it.
25129	Elliot	You know, it is our obligation as doctors to tell someone when there is a problem.
25130	Elliot	Good God, you smell like baby.
25131	Dr. Cox	I've only actually met the child once, so I think it's pretty important that we figure out a way to spend some alone-time with him.
25132	Jordan	Perry, if I'm gonna be spending a lot of time with someone else's child, it's gonna be with our neighbor's 17-year-old.

25134	J.D.	Hello! Anybody home?
25135	Carla	J.D., we're right here!
25136	J.D.'s Thoughts	Tell them you want to come back!
25137	J.D.	I just came by to get my toothbrush.
25138	Turk	Carla took your toothbrush out the bathroom and put it in the hall closet.
25139	J.D.	Finger. Bingo.
25140	Carla	We should ask him back.
25141	Turk	Baby, no. We're too proud. We are the proud Turks.
25142	J.D.	Hey, guys! The heater's broken again.
25143	Carla	What happened?
25144	J.D.'s Thoughts	I clubbed it with a Mag-Lite.
25145	J.D.	I could probably stay and fix it. It could take three, four, five days.
25146	Turk	I did a triple bypass yesterday. I think I could fix the heater.
25147	J.D.	Suit yourself.
25148	Janitor	So I hear you're homeless. I wanna volunteer, give you a place to stay.
25149	J.D.	I don't think so, buddy.
25150	Janitor	Listen, crash in my garage. I guarantee you there will not be another person in there.
25151	J.D.	You're gonna slather jam on my face and sic a family of raccoons on me, aren't you!
25152	Janitor	Damn it. I've become predictable.
25153	J.D.	I'm out.
25154	Janitor	Oh, yeah? Well, from what I hear I'm your last option.
25155	J.D.	Options?! I got cable TV and a dead dog! I got plenty of options!
25156	Ted	Come on in. I've got a huge king bed. It'll be nice to have a buffer between me and my mom.
25157	Lonnie	Sorry, bro. We're a little crowded tonight.
25158	J.D.	Lonnie, you have three kids?
25159	Lonnie	That I know of.
25160	Ed McMahon	Yeah?
25161	J.D.	Does Doug Murphy live here?
25162	Ed McMahon	The pathologist?
25163	J.D.	Yeah.
25164	Ed McMahon	No. He moved out.
25165	J.D.	Okay.... But, Mr. McMahon, would you mind
25166	Ed McMahon	Hi-ohhhhhhhhhhh!
25167	J.D.	You are correct, sir!
25168	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
25169	Ron	So, why do you wanna baby-sit my kid? You think I can't handle my own kid?
25170	Dr. Cox	No, that's not it at all. I think you're great with your kid. You're fantastic with your kid. In fact, in fact if you want, you can baby-sit my kid.
25171	Ron	Are we really doing this? 'Cause I'll baby-sit the hell outta your kid.
25172	Dr. Cox	Oh, bring it on, daddy.
25173	J.D.	Who needs a baby-sitter? I'll do it! You don't even have to pay me in cash, just pay me in hot showers. And you don't have to, like, wash me unless you want to, but that could be weird. I don't know.
25174	Dr. Cox	Newbie, I've got this one covered.
25175	J.D.	Come on, you two are interracial best buddies. I, too, have a black best friend. Go out, enjoy it! Celebrate your uniqueness! I can do it!
25176	Ron	I'm sorry. Did you just call me black? Because the last time I checked, the correct term was "African-American."
25177	J.D.	Well, Turk lets me call him Brown Bear.
25178	Ron	Who the hell is Turk?!
25179	J.D.	I should go.
25180	Dr. Cox	Angry black man. It never disappoints.
25181	Ron	I pull it out when I need to.
25182	Dr. Cox	Well, what do you say?
25183	Ron	Well, I do have a lot of work to get done.... You can watch Nate.
25184	Dr. Cox	You got it.
25185	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes the worst thing is getting exactly what you want.
25186	Dr. Cox	Nathan? Look at me.
25187	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
25188	Turk	Baby?
25189	Carla	Hmm?
25190	Turk	Could you get me a towel so I could wipe this sweat from my head?
25191	Carla	They're all dirty, okay? J.D. used to wash them.
25192	Turk	It's so hot! When the hell is he gonna finish fixing the heater?!
25193	Carla	It's okay! He's a professional I'm sure he's almost done.
25194	Janitor	This...should not have been removed.
25195	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
25196	Kylie	Todd made you wear a banana hammock to bed?
25197	J.D.	It was horrible. I kept imagining I was an Olympic diver.
25198	Kylie	Well, it means a lot to me that you would go through all that just to respect my boundaries.
25199	J.D.	Thanks, Kylie. I can just sleep on the couch.
25200	Kylie	You don't have to crash on the couch.
25201	Kylie	Well, Dr. Dorian, are you gonna join me?
25202	J.D.'s Thoughts	I couldn't have planned it better.
25203	Carla	J.D.!
25204	J.D.	I don't want to come home. It took me a month to get here from the couch.
25205	Kylie	Uh, J.D., maybe you should go home.
25206	J.D.'s Thoughts	Get the moment back! Say something hot!
25207	J.D.	Perhaps we could invite Turk and Carla to join us on the bed?
25208	J.D.	I'll go.
25209	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
25210	Elliot	I think it is so great that you're gonna talk to your friend. And I know it's gonna be hard, so if you need me, you just say the word and I will jump right in.
25211	Dr. Cox	I need to talk to you about Nathan.
25212	Ron	That little guy's my life.
25213	Elliot	I've gotta go.
25214	Ron	What's up?
25215	Dr. Cox	Ron, there is no easy way to do this, so I'm just gonna go ahead and say it.
25216	Ron	This is...this is unbelievable.
25217	Dr. Cox	I know, but the good news here is that we found out early, so you can be as proactive as you
25218	Ron	No, no, no. You are unbelievable. I mean...you can't handle the fact that my kid is better than your kid at building blocks, so you tell me there's something wrong with him?!
25219	Dr. Cox	That's just not gonna happen. No way.
25220	J.D.'s Narration	At first I was a little disappointed that I wasn't sleeping at Kylie's, but it was good to be home.
25221	J.D.	I'm home!
25222	J.D.	You guys moved couch?
25223	J.D.'s Narration	It's always nice to let your friends know that you appreciate them.
25224	Turk	I'm glad you're home, buddy.
25225	J.D.	I missed you, my African-American friend.
25226	Turk	Call me Brown Bear.
25227	J.D.	Brown Bear.
25228	Dr. Cox	This, uh...is a classmate of mine from medical school. He's located up in your area now. I think he'd really be able to help you.
25229	J.D.'s Narration	But sometimes you just can't quite find words to show that appreciation.
25230	Ron	You know, uh...I just wanna say that, uh, I'm gonna handle this kid situation so much better than you ever could.
25231	Dr. Cox	Oh, give me a break. I would kick your ass in situation-handling. I'm a doctor, for God sakes. And, for the record, the Vegas odds-makers are makin' Coxy a heavy favorite.
25232	Ron	Well, then, I would just bet on me and make a bundle.
25233	Dr. Cox	You know what? I probably would, too.
25234	J.D.	Aha! Behold, the Twinkie from the first day we moved in! I owe you an apology, Turk.
25235	Turk	Of course.
25236	Turk	Heh. Want some?
25237	Carla	No.
25238	Turk	Okay, fine. More for me.
25239	Carla	So, Bambi, what's the deal with all the things you do around here?
25240	J.D.	What do you mean?
25241	Carla	The laundry, the fixing the radiator, the listening to me gossip and playing stupid games with Turk. How do you make yourself do all that stuff?
25242	J.D.'s Narration	At the end of the day, the best thing to do for your friends is to be honest.
25243	J.D.	I don't know, I never really thought about it. I guess when you care about someone, you'll do whatever you can to make 'em happy.
25244	J.D.'s Narration	You just have to hope that your honesty doesn't make them realize something they didn't wanna know.
25245	Carla	We're in trouble, aren't we.
25246	Turk	Yeah.
25247	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
25248	J.D.	*Kylie and I still haven't slept together, but I had a feeling her
25249	Kylie	I have a surprise for you tonight.
25250	J.D.	*God, I hope it's sex. Or a pony. I'll bet it's sex because I don't
25251	Kylie	Wait right here. It's for your scooter What are you doing?
25252	J.D.	Nothing. I was just going to do a little laundry. I assume your
25253	Kylie	Why is it always about sex with you?
25254	J.D.	It's not! Look. Kylie. I'm just really proud of my abs. Or... ab.
25255	J.D.	*Turk and Carla were having some relationship trouble of their own.
25256	Turk	Baby, I don't understand why we can't discuss this after The A-Team.
25257	Carla	Turk, a lot of married couples hit roadblocks their first year, but
25258	Turk	Okay. Let's do this.
25259	Carla	Okay. What's bother
25260	Turk	Hey hey! There he is! My buddy hit it and quit it, didn't he?
25261	J.D.	*Hell no.* Hell yes! Now if you'll excuse me, it's time for my nightly
25262	Carla	See Turk? This is our problem. We're trying to have a serious
25263	Turk	Okay, you know what bothers me? Every little thing with you becomes a
25264	Carla	When have I ever made a mountain out of a molehill?
25265	Carla	Turk! If you can't remember to put the cap on the toothpaste how are
25266	Carla	I guess I could work on it a little.
25267	Elliot	Okay. The patient is in shock so the first thing we want to try to
25268	Dr. Cox	I know. I wasn't -ing you to indicate an incorrect answer. I
25269	Elliot	Ah, you're a wonderful teacher! Now stop -ing me in front of
25270	Dr. Cox	You're right Barbie. Carry on.
25271	Elliot	Ahem. So, when you're dealing with cardiogenic shock,
25272	Dr. Cox	BONG!
25273	Elliot	Let's keep moving.
25274	Janitor	You know, I don't really appreciate you messing with my lady.
25275	Dr. Cox	Your lady.
25276	Janitor	Blonde Doctor and I are going to end up together. I'm talking the
25277	Dr. Cox	I guess it wouldn't be the first time the janitor got the girl. Oh,
25278	Janitor	You want to place a wager?
25279	Dr. Cox	I do. But here I really have no need for a cracked thermos and two
25280	Janitor	How about my van for your Porsche?
25281	Dr. Cox	I suppose when I win I could destroy your vehicle and make you
25282	Janitor	Bet.
25283	Turk	Alright. Give me all the details on Kylie.
25284	J.D.	Dude it was so naughty. We're kissing, right, and she's like "I think
25285	Turk	Damn you, ruptured spleen! To be continued!

25287	Molly	Howdy, stranger. Do you still want me?
25288	J.D.	Yes please.
25289	Molly	Hey stranger. Ouch!
25290	J.D.	*So Molly's back in town. She definitely wants me.*
25291	Molly	Bye. How you doing, J.J.?
25292	J.D.	That's J.D.
25293	Molly	Oh, right. I was just thinking of that Jimmy Walker sitcom.
25294	J.D.	Good Times?
25295	Molly	Not great, my sister had a miscarriage.
25296	Elliot	Molly? Oh my God! You look fantastic!
25297	Molly	So do you!
25298	Elliot	How's Milwaukee?
25299	Molly	It's okay. I'm just here to see a patient.
25300	J.D.	*Even though she did the fake forget-my-name thing, she's here for me.
25301	Patient	They've landed. Grab some blankets and all the canned goods you can
25302	Molly	Apparently he's gotten really possessive of me. He won't talk to the
25303	J.D.	Molly, I'm sure he's not that possessive.
25304	Patient	Get away from my doctor!
25305	J.D.	Get him off! Get him off!
25306	Molly	Patrick, down.
25307	Turk	It is so good to laugh like this with
25308	Dr. Cox	I'm on a break here, Newbie. Just tell your shiny headed roommate
25309	J.D.	Would you give him a break? He's talking to his wife.
25310	Carla	Has anybody seen Mr. Jennings' file? Oh,
25311	Dr. Cox	This just got interesting.
25312	J.D.	Who are you talking to?
25313	Turk	Rosanna.
25314	J.D.	Your college girlfriend?
25315	Turk	Yeah.
25316	J.D.	Can I say hi?
25317	Turk	Yeah.
25318	J.D.	Hey Rosanna.
25319	Turk	Dude, what the hell!
25320	Rosanna	Hello? Hello? J.D.?
25321	J.D.	This phone is indestructible! If it has a camera, I'm so getting one.
25322	Rosanna	Is anybody there?
25323	Turk	Dude!!!
25324	J.D.	Why are you talking to your college girlfriend?
25325	Turk	We're just friends!
25326	Kelso	Ahhh, just friends... I was just friends once with a Vietnamese girl.
25327	Cox	Unlike you, Bobbo, Gandhi here is in a healthy relationship. I mean,
25328	Turk	He gets me.
25329	J.D.	Give me a pound, dawg.
25330	Kelso	Does he know you were being sarcastic?
25331	Cox	I hope not.

25337	Molly	So, you seeing anyone?
25338	Elliot	I went on a few dates with a guy named Rick, but then he met my mom
25339	Molly	She didn't like him?
25340	Elliot	No, she loved him. They're in Aruba.
25341	J.D.	God, I'd love to get with Molly.
25342	Turk	Dude, you're pretty horny for a guy who claims to be getting it on a
25343	J.D.	What are you implying?
25344	Turk	Let's just say a little birdie told me that you and Kylie haven't

25346	Turk	Nurse Birdie.
25347	Nurse Birdie	Well, you haven't.
25348	J.D.	I trusted you!
25349	Turk	Dude, it's been a month.
25350	J.D.	Oh really Turk? Has it been a month? Because time just flies when
25351	Turk	Look. Kylie hasn't slept with you so what she's saying is that she
25352	J.D.	She did go to a movie with her brother-in-law.
25353	Turk	That's perfect. Dude, you can have your cake and eat it too. It's like
25354	of this positive energy back to Carla. Now this is what you do	you go out
25355	J.D.	That is the dumbest idea I've ever heard.
25356	Todd	So once you've got the hole at the bottom of the popcorn box, it's

25358	Ted	You want to get Elliot, get in good with her best friend.
25359	Janitor	Who's Elliot? Oooh.
25360	Ted	Trust me. The way I got my girlfriend in junior high was by getting her
25361	Janitor	And how'd you do that?
25362	Ted	I posed as her dad so she could rent a car. I lost my hair in eighth
25363	Todd	Tough break five.
25364	Janitor	I'm going in. Um. We should be friends.
25365	Molly	Okay.
25366	Janitor	Do you like vanning?
25367	Molly	I don't know what that is.
25368	Janitor	It's kind of my thing. It's like taking a long drive in a car, only
25369	Molly	I'm still not getting it.
25370	Janitor	Could you hang on for one sec?
25371	Carla	Turk. I found your cell phone in the parking lot.
25372	J.D.	Four stories and not a scratch. What are you made of?
25373	Carla	You got three missed phone calls. All from a Rosanna. Isn't that your
25374	Elliot	So, what's been going on with you?
25375	Molly	I went to India for two weeks.
25376	Kelso	Ladies, this is a hospital, not the junior league. Let's break it up.
25377	Molly	I moved to Milwaukee four months ago.
25378	Kelso	Welcome back.
25379	Elliot	So this trip to India sounds so exotic.
25380	J.D.	Hey, Kylie. I was calling to see how your day was going.
25381	Molly	...this ninety degree cave and sweat would just be dripping off our
25382	J.D.	Naked sweat drips...
25383	Kylie	What?
25384	J.D.	Um, nothing, Kylie. It's a new band called the Naked Sweat Drips. They
25385	Molly	...And then I got so flexible I could put my legs behind my head.
25386	Kylie	J.D., are you there?
25387	Molly	You should come.
25388	Elliot	Oh, frick on a stick. I gotta go. I want to hear the rest of the
25389	J.D.	Feet up behind her head.
25390	Kylie	Who has their feet behind their head?
25391	J.D.	A patient, Kylie. Horrible car accident. You gotta wear your seatbelt,
25392	Molly	Hey. I'm getting out of here. Do you want to grab a beer?
25393	J.D.	*They say the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry.*
25394	Carla	I can't believe you've been talking to her.
25395	Turk	Now honey, is it possible you're making mountains out of molehills?
25396	Carla	Dammit!
25397	J.D.	*Still, sometimes, plans go exactly like they're supposed to.*
25398	Elliot	You paged me?
25399	Janitor	Yeah, look. I made a bet with Dr. Cox that you would go out with
25400	J.D.	*And the success of those plans can take even the most hardened men by
25401	Elliot	Do you mind? I'm trying to have a private moment with my man.
25402	Cox	Oh God...
25403	Elliot	I got lipstick on you.
25404	Janitor	No. Leave it.
25405	J.D.	*And sometimes, even the best of men can go awry.*
25406	Kylie	So, are you coming over tonight?
25407	Carla	Hey J.D.
25408	Turk	Buddy, you should try that cake I was telling you about!
25409	J.D.	Actually, Kylie. I... I can't tonight.
25410	J.D.	*If having my cake and eating it too meant being with Molly, then
25411	Elliot	Hey guys, you going out?
25412	J.D.	Yeah! You should come with us!
25413	Molly	That's the 'Close' button.
25414	J.D.	Oh no, it's the 'Close' button. When somebody gets close it activates
25415	Molly	Fancy.
25416	J.D.	*Oh no! She's got a pinky hold! Elliot's got the pinky strength of a
25417	Elliot	You're pressing the

25419	Cox	I gotta tell you there, Supercuts. I've seen a lot of crazy things at
25420	Janitor	I'm going to paint your Porsche mint green so it looks like my
25421	Kelso	Trong Tree,
25422	Carla	Whoa! Rosanna gets her own personal ringtone but I don't?
25423	Turk	Baby, I don't have to answer this.
25424	Carla	It's cool. I got the ring that matters, right?
25425	Kelso	Nurse Turkleton, I want to talk to you about these discharge We can talk later.
25426	Elliot	You need to come get a drink.
25427	Carla	Yes I do.
25428	Elliot	Janitor! So, did Dr. Cox pay up?
25429	Janitor	No! No! He says that he needs to see us on an actual date. In a
25430	Elliot	Okay, meet me at Stanwick's?
25431	Janitor	Sure.
25432	Janitor	Sorry guys, I can't go clubbing tonight. Daddy's got a date.
25433	Ted	Aw man! I ironed my going out hair!
25434	Molly	You know, they make thongs specifically for low-riders now.
25435	Elliot	They don't work for me. I still can't sit down without showing the
25436	J.D.	*Some guy... I never get credit for anything!*
25437	Carla	So you guys think I'm overreacting about this whole Turk thing?
25438	Elliot	Phone calls from an ex would drive me nuts!
25439	J.D.	*I knew how to get rid of both of them, but I can't do that to Turk.*
25440	Mr. Peeps	If you don't do it, I will.
25441	J.D.	*Mr. Peeps? Why are you British?*
25442	Mr. Peeps	I'll explain later. Just lose the extra bitches.
25443	J.D.	Carla, go talk to Turk. Share with him your feelings. That's what he
25444	Carla	Yeah?
25445	Elliot	Come on. I'll drive you. I gotta go to dinner anyway.
25446	Mr. Peeps	You're welcome.
25447	Molly	We should probably go too. It's getting late.
25448	J.D.	Oh, no no no. I just ordered two drinks.
25449	Carla	Hey Turk.
25450	Turk	I promise, I will visit you soon.
25451	Carla	I don't care if I seem crazy.
25452	Turk	Anything for you. You know that.
25453	Elliot	College was weird. I was so worried about being liked that I let my
25454	Janitor	Oh, I'm sure he'll be here soon. I kissed a dude once. It was at furnace camp.
25455	J.D.	*Okay J.D., you're a little drunk. And you know what happens when you
25456	Molly	It's tough making new friends in Milwaukee.
25457	J.D.	*I said control yourself!* You know
25458	Molly	You think so?
25459	J.D.	I do. *I knew at that moment what would happen if I reached over and
25460	Cox	Well, if

25462	Elliot	Wait, why did we just go out if you already have his car?
25463	Cox	Oh, my goodness. He actually tricked you into a date. This is so very
25464	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
25465	Elliot	You're unbelievable.
25466	Janitor	You're the only one around here that treats me like a real person.
25467	Elliot	What did you just say?
25468	Janitor	There was one other girl, a few years ago... Red Haired Doctor. She
25469	Elliot	You know what, it's okay. I actually had a good time.
25470	Janitor	Thanks. Elliot.
25471	J.D.	Oh, Kylie. I'm sorry. I hope it's okay that I stopped by. What was that for?
25472	Kylie	I was thinking about how patient you've been with me. How right
25473	J.D.	Wait, are you saying that you're ready? Awesome.
25474	Kylie	First, let me set the mood.
25475	J.D.	And Kylie, you're right. It is fate. Because I was out with this girl
25476	Kylie	You blew me off tonight to be with some random girl?
25477	J.D.	Well, she's not a random girl. I mean, I had a crush on her long
25478	Mr. Peeps	I will kill you!
25479	Kylie	You should go.
25480	J.D.	*I was in trouble. And if I didn't play my cards right, I knew what
25481	J.D.	*See, that's the thing about trying to have your cake and eating it
25482	Ted	We can fix that.
25483	Janitor	You guys are out.
25484	Randall	She's at a Ludacris concert with her birth mom.
25485	Janitor	I lose my van to him, and I lose Margo to gangsta rap. Bad day.
25486	J.D.	*And really, who wants to risk something important, just for a silly
25487	Turk	I did it! Cut off all ties with Rosanna. Forever.
25488	Carla	Baby, that took like twenty seconds. How did you do that so quickly?
25489	Turk	It was easy. I just told her I was married.
25490	Carla	You've been talking to this girl you used to sleep with, and you
25491	Turk	She never asked?
25492	Carla	It's no big deal. Because if you're lucky, maybe you won't be married
25493	Turk	Baby. Baby!
25494	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
25495	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
25496	J.D.	*In my four years there have been many emergencies at Sacred Heart, but none like this one, because today * Where is he? *Dr. Cox's son needed two stitches.* Dr. Cox, got here as soon as I
25497	Cox	Shut it, Newbie. Your blacker half is trying to concentrate.
25498	J.D.	How are you holding up?
25499	Turk	I'm a little nervous.
25500	J.D.	Well now you make me all nervous.
25501	Cox	I'd focus, because that tiny patch of skin on my son's forehead is more important to me than the entirety of your whole high-fiving, head-shaving, air-balling, mole-lipping, insulin-needing existence, which I guarantee you will come to an abrupt very unnatural end.
25502	Turk	Okay, I'm done.
25503	J.D.	*We all held our breath together.*
25504	Cox	The surgeon lives!
25505	J.D.	The Todd forgot to breathe again. Starting CPR.
25506	Elliot	Mr. Gerst, what seems to be the problem?
25507	Gerst	I took some pills.
25508	Elliot	Come on, help me out here. Were they happy pills, sad pills, sleepy pills, wake up pills, sane pills, pain pills, brain pills, Spain pills...
25509	Gerst	Man pills? The commercial says I should consult a physician if the condition persists for more than four hours.
25510	Elliot	If what persists? Oh! Um... Let's just say you took uppers.
25511	Turk	Hey dude, check out what I found when I was taking out the trash!
25512	J.D.	That is the most ridiculous hat I've ever seen. *And I must have it.*
25513	Turk	I've got time.
25514	J.D.	*Turk and Carla were having relationship troubles so she'd been staying at Elliot's for a few days.* You were late the last time.
25515	Turk	Yeah, but I set the clock ahead an hour last night so I wouldn't be late.
25516	J.D.	Yeah, but last week I set it back three hours so we could see what it felt like to live in Honolulu.
25517	Turk	Yeah, but then I set the clock ahead five hours so I wouldn't feel like a skeeve for watching porn in the middle of the day.
25518	J.D.	But then I set it back forty-three minutes to 8:08, turned the clock upside-down to see if it looked like the word Bob, which incidentally, it totally does
25519	Turk	That's true.
25520	J.D.	Which means that it's actually...
25521	Together	9:52!
25522	Turk	Oh my God, dude, I've got to be downtown in like eight minutes!
25523	Turk	Dude, we're never going to make it in time! Take the shortcut through that hedge!
25524	J.D.	You got it, player! Hold on buddy!
25525	Turk	That was a thick bush!
25526	J.D.	Oh really, Turk, was it a thick bush? Because there's berries in my ass! Just go!
25527	Turk	Sorry. My bad, dude, my bad.
25528	J.D.	Don't worry, Turk, I got 'em!
25529	Carla	Turk, why are you wearing pajamas?
25530	Turk	Uh, I really want you to come home and on the off chance you said yes, I'd be ready to snuggle. And that would hopefully lead to but not necessarily require relations of the intimate nature.
25531	Carla	Turk, with everything that's happened I'm just having trouble trusting you.
25532	Turk	Baby, if there's anyone in this world that you can trust, it's me.
25533	Carla	Turk, you're the one I don't know if I can trust, so how am I supposed to trust that I can trust you telling me that I can trust you?
25534	Turk	My head hurts.
25535	J.D.	I wish I knew how it was going. Sorry about your hogs, fellas. Enjoy the free espressos. Warlord, I told you to sip it. Use your words.
25536	Warlord	Warlord... burn mouth.
25537	J.D.	Yeah he did, because he wasn't listening. Napkin on your lap, Satan's Valet. Thank you.
25538	Cox	Hey. What are you doing, Frankenstein?
25539	Janitor	Photo journal. For my photography class.
25540	Cox	Terrific, could I see your camera? Very interesting. Oh, there's film in it.
25541	Janitor	Hey! All my pictures were in there! Dead patient with fancy shirt. Dead patient without fancy shirt. Me in fancy shirt being yelled at by angry family.
25542	Cox	Do you have any idea what events would unfold if Jordan were to actually see that picture? It is a heartwrenching tale of woe involving Jordan's second cousin who plays for the New England Patriots and me having a Super Bowl ring removed from my esophagus. No, Jordan's never going to see these stitches.
25543	Janitor	Well, I hope you realize this means war.
25544	Cox	Ah, buzz off, you big monkey.
25545	Elliot	Poor Mr. Gerst. I wonder what that's like, to have an erection for nine hours.
25546	Todd	Ask me in twenty minutes.
25547	Elliot	Oh, get this. He doesn't even have erectile dysfunction. I mean, why would you take those drugs if you didn't need them?
25548	Cox	What's this? Why, it's a dummy-gram. And it's addressed to you, Barbie. Let's read it and find out what's in there. "You are disturbingly naive. Stop. Almost fifty percent of ED drugs are taken by recreational users. Stop."
25549	Elliot	That can't be true.
25550	Cox	Everyone. Would you go ahead and close your eyes for a second? Great. Now, would all the men in the room who've tried Mr. Happy pills go ahead and grab your fork and bang your glass. Thank you!
25551	Elliot	Ted! Everyone stopped.
25552	Ted	Oh. Dammit!
25553	Turk	Dude, she's got this whole trust issue with me.
25554	J.D.	Just tell her she can trust you.
25555	Turk	I did. But apparently if I'm the one she didn't know she could trust, how's she supposed to trust she can trust me telling her she can trust me?
25556	J.D.	My head hurts.
25557	Turk	Yeah, mine did too. That's why I need you to go in.
25558	J.D.	No way, dude. It's never smart to get in the middle of someone else's relationship.
25559	Turk	I'll let you wear my top hat.
25560	J.D.	Hey! Wanna grab a beer?
25561	Carla	If you lose the hat.
25562	Jordan	Hi.
25563	Cox	Hello there.
25564	Jordan	What's with all the band-aids?
25565	Cox	Oh, Jack was just getting nutty, having some fun. See, I even let him put one on me.
25566	Jordan	Really? Are those stitches?!
25567	Cox	What are the odds you'd pick that one? Jack just He just fell off of the jungle gym.
25568	Jordan	You're not careful enough with him!
25569	Cox	What about the time you had him and he brained himself on the coffee table?
25570	Jordan	That was an accident.
25571	Cox	Just a quick question. Why is it an accident when he's with you, but when Jack gets hurt on my time it's because I'm not careful enough?
25572	Jordan	Because, I
25573	Cox	Oh dear God, you're speechless. I won! I won an argument! Jack, it's unprecedented. We'll be at the playground drinking beer. Oh God, we love beer!
25574	Paper Clip Intern	That guy needs to do some serious thinking about baseball.
25575	Todd	He wouldn't even let me see it.
25576	Elliot	Hey meathead! Oh good, you both looked. Now, Mr. Gerst came here for help, and we're doctors, so how about we try and treat him with at least a little bit of dignity and respect, okay?
25577	Kelso	That man is a human sundial!
25578	Carla	Oh, it's so nice to get out. Oh, hey do you know who sings this song?
25579	J.D.	No, but I can tell you who doesn't sing it. Billy Joel, who brought us such hits as "Uptown Girl" and "Matter of Trust". And speaking of trust, do you know who's really trustworthy? Turk. I call him Turkey Turkey Turkey Turkey Trust Trust. A little nickname.
25580	Carla	J.D., I know what you're trying to do and it's very sweet, but the last couple of days have been so messed up and confusing, I'd love to just try and forget about it and have a few drinks, okay?
25581	J.D.	But I told Turk I'd talk about him constantly until you made me leave.
25582	Carla	I'll let you put the hat back on.
25583	J.D.	Two appletinis, guv'ner!
25584	Dad	Look at my girl. Right back up on the monkey bars, even after she chipped her tooth there last week.
25585	Cox	That's nothing. My kid's got a forehead full of stitches from leaping off the jungle gym.
25586	Dad	When my wife's not around, I let my daughter stand on my shoulders.
25587	Cox	Really? Wait til you get a load of this. Okay, here we go. What a Come here you. You come here, you. A little girl approaches him.]
25588	Girl	Giant Man, why are you making that noise?
25589	Janitor	Oh. Well, cause my camera doesn't make a real sound, and it's more fun that way. See, here you go. Look happy. Look sad. Look crazy. Look like you're going away.
25590	Elliot	You're coming in because you need to set an example of professionalism and you're certainly not going to do that by making fun of that man's slinky-doo.
25591	Kelso	Don't pull me, I'm your boss for God's Hello!
25592	Elliot	So, Mr. Gerst. Your situation doesn't seem to be reversing itself. I think we're going to need to schedule a procedure to relieve the... uh...
25593	Kelso	Woodiness.
25594	Gerst	My fiancee's only twenty-four and she said she wanted to do something special this morning. Turns out she just meant having breakfast with her family. The pills didn't really kick in until just about the moment I'm introduced to her ninety year old grandma. Sure enough, that little lady gives me the waist hug from her wheelchair.
25595	Elliot	Excuse me, I need that chart.
25596	Kelso	Sweetheart, it's not healthy to hold it in. Just let it out. You know you want to.
25597	Elliot	I'm fine.
25598	Gerst	I pulled away from that encounter with all of Grandma Helen's breathing apparatus.
25599	Kelso	My work here is done.
25600	Elliot	Oh my God, I can't stop! Sorry! I have to pee!
25601	Carla	J.D., why are we sitting up here?
25602	J.D.	Because you can see Elliot's whole apartment from up here.
25603	Carla	J.D., you're drunk!
25604	J.D.	Carla, I'm not as think as you drunk I am. I mean...
25605	Carla	Then why can't you let go of the couch?
25606	J.D.	I can let go of the couch, if I so choose.
25607	Carla	Okay, let go of the couch. Let go! You see?
25608	J.D.	*There are many things we can't control, no matter how strong we might be. Like a kneejerk reaction.*
25609	Elliot	I'm so sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
25610	Gerst	It's okay.
25611	J.D.	*Or a Janitor who has it in for you.*
25612	Jordan	Hi! Look what someone was nice enough to give me.
25613	Cox	Janitor!
25614	Carla	Thank you, for helping me have some fun tonight.
25615	J.D.	You're welcome. *And sometimes, you let go of the control you do have in a brief moment of weakness.* Sorry. Drunken accident.
25616	Carla	Nothing happened.
25617	J.D.	Right.
25618	Carla	Good night.
25619	J.D.	Good night.
25620	Carla	Good night.
25621	J.D.	Good night.
25622	Carla	Buenas noches.
25623	J.D.	Buenas... those things.
25624	Carla	Good night.
25625	J.D.	*Like she said, everything's fine.*
25626	J.D.	*There's nothing like the rays of the morning sun kissing you awake and gently reminding you that you got drunk and kissed your best friend's wife.* Oh my God!
25627	Carla	Oh my God. So it really happened?
25628	J.D.	Yeah, but it was nothing!
25629	Carla	Nothing!
25630	J.D.	No! There wasn't even any tongue!
25631	Carla	No tongue!
25632	J.D.	It was just a friend kiss!
25633	Carla	Were your lips parted at all?
25634	J.D.	No, I pursed them like this.
25635	Carla	I don't know, J.D. I remember my one lip being on top of your upper lip and my other lip being somewhere in the middle of yours, which means your lips were apart and I don't think that's a friend kiss.
25636	J.D.	Yes it is! It's a friend kiss and we will never talk about this to anyone ever!
25637	Elliot	What's going on?
25638	J.D.	Nothing.
25639	Carla	J.D. and I kissed.
25640	J.D.	Carla!
25641	Elliot	You kissed? Like a friend kiss?
25642	J.D.	Yes!
25643	Carla	No!
25644	J.D.	Carla! You're killing me!
25645	Elliot	Why did you close my window?
25646	Elliot	Oh no, she wrote "J.D. and Carla kissed" on the paper and she's going to tell Turk!
25647	Carla	No! Stop her!
25648	J.D.	Don't worry, ladies. I've closed the window.
25649	Elliot	J.D., I don't have a messenger monkey.
25650	Cox	Alright, fine. I'm a little rougher than you are, but guess what? The two of us have two distinctively different parenting styles. You're an overbearing hypercautious psychotic, and I'm... well, you know... fun? And I think if we could meet somewhere in the middle, I think Jack's going to be terrific! And besides, it's not like I ever put him in any real danger.
25651	Jack	Flip.
25652	Jordan	Flip? What does flip mean, Perry?
25653	Cox	Jack probably thinks that Mommy and Daddy are being a little too sarcastic with each other.
25654	Janitor	Maybe. Or, it's because every time he says "Flip" Daddy does a little trick where he grabs Jack by the ankles, he flips him upside down, he drops him down onto his shoulders, and then puts him in a little baby trapeze, shoots him across the sandbox without a net.
25655	Jordan	You are never taking Jack to the park without me. Ever!
25656	Cox	Jordan! A trapeze?
25657	Janitor	Yeah! Photoshop. You can do anything! Here I have you wearing a duck's bill. Get it? Because you're a quack! No? Ha ha ha ha, come on!
25658	Elliot	I'm such a horrible person. I mean, there I was, up on my high horse about Mr. Gerst and then I just turned out to be just as bad as everyone else.
25659	Kelso	Sweetheart, give yourself some credit. You're much worse than everyone else.
25660	Elliot	Maybe I was. But you know what? I'm going to try to better myself, and unlike you, I'm going to follow through, Mr. "Sign up on the Hospital Bulletin Board for Private German Lessons and then Never Show Up"! Yeah, that's right. That was my flyer! I waited at that coffee shop for hours.
25661	Kelso	I broke up with my German mistress. She smelled like sauerkraut.
25662	Elliot	I'm so sorry. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go into that room right now, and own up to what I did.
25663	Gerst	Hello? Did someone come in?
25664	J.D.	I had to hide from Turk, so I went to the one place that I knew no one would ever venture. Ted? Ted?
25665	Ted	A little help!
25666	J.D.	Ted, what are you doing?
25667	Ted	I like to do stomach crunches after lunch.
25668	J.D.	Ted, lunch was four hours ago.
25669	Ted	Yep, I wasted most of my Tuesday.
25670	J.D.	It's Wednesday.
25671	Ted	Aw, man! I missed the Gilmore Girls!
25672	Turk	There you are. Hey Ted. So how'd it go last night?
25673	J.D.	Whoa! What's with the fifth degree?
25674	Turk	Don't you mean third degree?
25675	J.D.	No, because this is two degrees worse. I can't breathe, it's like you're all over me. I'm trapped in a death coffin.
25676	Turk	Calm down, I just want to see if you got anywhere with Carla.
25677	J.D.	*Alright, he knows your lying face, but silence is incriminating too. So think. What's between silence and talking?*
25678	Carla	Turk? I thought you could take me over to Elliot's place to get my stuff so I could move back in.
25679	Turk	Yeah, su Really? Alright, but meet me downstairs, okay?
25680	Carla	Okay.
25681	Turk	I owe you one.
25682	J.D.	Ted, you should probably sit down. You're looking a little purple.
25683	Ted	I know my own body.
25684	J.D.	Thanks for saving my ass.
25685	Carla	Well, I wasn't saving your ass. I didn't realize how easy it is to make little mistakes. They're stupid little mistakes that seem like nothing but can snowball on you and take your whole marriage with it, you know? I feel like I really understand now how Turk could have let stuff like that happen, you know? So I forgave him.
25686	J.D.	I guess I'm glad we kissed then.
25687	Carla	Me too.
25688	Turk	You guys ready?
25689	Carla	Yeah, we are. Let's do it.
25690	Jordan	Okay. We just saw the plastic surgeon. Jack's fine. But if the cut was four inches to the left and seven inches deeper, it could have potentially scratched his eye.
25691	Cox	That was a close one.
25692	Woman	What a sweet little angel! Can I just give him a little squeeze?
25693	Jordan	Of course.
25694	Cox	Back off there, lady. How's about you save up all that energy for the cruise? Go on get out of here. Hippity hop to the barbershop. Come on, Mom. Jordan, this hospital is literally crawling with germs and disease and in all fairness, you don't know if that lady is a sickie or if she was here visiting a sickie and she ran her sickie hands all over her sickie face.
25695	Jordan	I normally never let people touch him.
25696	Janitor	Oh really? Because these photographs would beg to differ. Old lady, kissing Jack. Teenage girl, hugging Jack. Homeless man, holding Jack.
25697	Cox	Jordan!
25698	Jordan	That's just Carl. He holds Jack when I get a bikini wax! What's the matter with me? I mean, I don't think twice about people holding him, and yet I obsess about things like broken arms, broken legs, choking, kidnapping, drowning, silly putty, bad babysitters, pretty babysitters...
25699	Cox	Yeah, I pretty much freak out over staff infections, blood disease, mumps, measles, sex, drugs, rock and roll, and definitely all registered independents. So I think between us we've got everything covered.
25700	Jordan	Was this taken at my mother's house?
25701	Janitor	I gotta go.
25702	Gerst	Dude, that did not happen.
25703	Elliot	Forty-seven... Forty-eight minutes. I'm not sure, I nodded off for a while. Mr. Gerst, I'm so sorry for laughing at you. But I have to tell you a story. When I was in the seventh grade, I was at a roller rink and I needed to go to the bathroom. So I just skated right on into a stall and I did my, uh, private business. And then when I went to pull up my pants, I started rolling towards the door, which as it turned out wasn't latched. Now, I don't know if you've had any experience roller skating with your underpants around your ankles it's very difficult to stop. Unless of course, you know, you scream so loud that they turn off the music and everyone is looking at you. Anyway, that's how I wound up with the nickname "Roller Moler".
25704	Gerst	I'm sorry?
25705	Elliot	I have a mole on my ass.
25706	Gerst	Why are you telling me this?
25707	Elliot	Because I owned up to it. This is funny, Mr. Gerst. And if you don't just embrace it and become part of the joke then it will follow you around and devour you.
25708	Gerst	Can I get a look at that mole?
25709	Elliot	No. Ahem. No.
25710	J.D.	This is nice. The three of us sitting together again like the Three Musketeers.
25711	Carla	Yeah! And I need you guys to scrape your plates before you put them in the dishwasher!
25712	Turk	She's back! My baby's back!
25713	J.D.	*Carla was right. If a relationship is going to work, it has to be based on trust. Like a wife trusting her husband again.*
25714	Dad	Hey. Kid's back on the jungle gym. Guess your wife backed down.
25715	Cox	You bet your sweet ass she did.
25716	J.D.	*Even if it involves a compromise.*
25717	Cox	Hey Jack! Just blink when you want me to get you down. Just give me the old blink-a-rooney. Terrific athlete. I'm thinking 2016 Olympics. Oh God, was that a blink? Excuse me.
25718	J.D.	*Or a patient trusting his doctor to help him hold on to his dignity.*
25719	Gerst	Yeah! And then I pulled off Grandma's breathing apparatus. No, I'm serious!
25720	J.D.	*It may take a lot of work, but it's worth it.*
25721	J.D.	Wow, that was a moist kiss. Wish I was wearing an apron.
25722	Turk	Baby, from here on out I hide nothing from you. It's a clean start for us. Sports time!
25723	J.D.	*Because in the end, things work out for the best.*
25724	Carla	J.D. and I kissed.
25725	J.D.	*Or not.*
25726	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
25727	J.D.'s Narration	Let me explain, Turk & Carla's marriage was in trouble because of some dumb stuff Turk had done. So last night I took Carla out to smooth things over.
25728	J.D.'s Narration	Long story short, we smooched.
25729	J.D.	Sorry, drunken accident.
25730	J.D.'s Narration	It was barely more than a friend kiss, so we decided not to tell Turk... or so I thought.
25731	Carla	J.D. & I kissed.
25732	J.D.'s Narration	Was it a comfortable silence? No. And I'm going to be the one who breaks it. Unfortunately I have one of Rowdy's hairs in my mouth... uh-oh!
25733	J.D.'s Narration	I guess there's a lot of things that can knock you on your ass...
25734	J.D.'s Narration continues	Like, for instance, when your 17-year-old neighbour doesn't see you as a smoking hottie anymore...
25735	Jordan	Oh, Pedro I can't seem to find my pencil. Do you have any idea where it might be?
25736	Pedro	Oh it's right there between your bosoms, ma'am.
25737	Jordan	Ma'am??? You just ma'amed your way out of me ever buying you beer again!
25738	Jordan	Ma'am?
25739	J.D.'s Narration continues	And of course, the one thing you can always count on to knock you on your ass...
25740	Dr. Kelso	AARRGGHH!
25741	J.D.'s Narration continues	Floor Wax.
25742	Janitor	Uncanny. Dr. Kelso, while I got you here, I need to discuss a hospital matter of grave importance.
25743	Dr. Kelso	What is it?
25744	Janitor	I'm not happy with my uniform.
25745	Dr. Kelso	Ahh new Janitor uniforms, top priority. Right up there with silk jammies for the patients and a cat door for the ICU.
25746	Janitor	I made some sketches.
25747	Dr. Kelso	This one has a cape!
25748	Janitor	That gives me the option of fighting crime.
25749	Janitor	After work, of course. Now this one, got sort of a medieval thing going.
25750	Dr. Kelso	Is he on a horse?
25751	Janitor	It's his steed, sir.
25752	Janitor	That's for clean-ups in outer space. This one's outer space, evening wear. This one's just a kangaroo... sometimes I draw kangaroos.
25753	Dr. Kelso	You know I could look at the demented crayon scratchings of a madman all day, but I got a hospital to run. Did you wax over there yet?
25754	Janitor	No sir.
25755	Janitor	I'll get a new uniform or I'll wax everything in your WORLD!
25756	Dr. Cox	Oh hey there wait 'til you get a load of this, they're giving me a teaching award tonight so I'm gonna need you to go ahead and holster up 'the twins' as you'll be playing the role of "arm-candy".
25757	Jordan	Yeah, I'm not going. If I wanna hear someone go on & on about how great you are, I'll just listen to you during sex.
25758	Dr. Cox	I'm hearing the hate but I'm not seeing the hate. You...
25759	Dr. Cox	Oh my God! Did you Botox you face into an expressionless mask?
25760	Jordan	Pedro called me ma'am.
25761	Dr. Cox	Ah damn it Jordan, come on. Now you know I'm generally OK with you putting any poison you want into your body, but this is the first time I've ever won anything!
25762	Jordan	It's not that bad.
25763	Dr. Cox	Reeeaaaly? Show me happy...
25764	Dr. Cox	Sad...
25765	Dr. Cox	Silly...
25766	Dr. Cox	Amused, bemused, c-mused...
25767	Dr. Cox	Show me angry.
25768	Dr. Cox	AARRGGHH!!
25769	Dr. Cox	Got angry down.
25770	J.D.'s Narration	When we got to work, not a whole lot had changed. The silence was killing me...
25771	Turk	You kissed my wife.
25772	J.D.'s Narration continues	I miss the silence.
25773	Turk	Did you like it?
25774	J.D.	Well that's kind of a trick question, Turk. I mean if I say yes, it's like I'm saying "damn dude, your wife is hot & I'd like to get me some of that". But if I say no then I'm all like "yo, I know she's your wife but you can keep that fish-lipped bitty".
25775	Turk	What about you Carla, did you like it?
25776	Carla	NO! His lips are chappy.
25777	J.D.	I can't use lip-balm; I always end up eating it. When I was little I used to spread it on crackers.
25778	Elliot	Ah, well if it isn't the happy couple. Oh and Turk's here too.
25779	Elliot	Ooo-K are we not laughing about this yet?
25780	Carla	Turk, look, I'm so sorry but you have to believe me. It was barely anything.
25781	J.D.	It was barely even a kiss dude; it was like an accidental lip bump, like oops.
25782	Turk	WHOOAAA! Don't even look at her. Sit on the floor.
25783	J.D.	Sitting .
25784	Carla	Fine, I'll show you with Elliot.
25785	Todd	Something wonderful is happening.
25786	Elliot	I don't understand why you're butting in on my patients, you know outside of your usual arrogance & God complex.
25787	Dr. Cox	I don't know what you're talking about. Kiss my ring.
25788	Dr. Cox	However, if you'd like to know about why I'm butting in, it's because your young patient Lindsay here, when she was 10 years old, I'm the one who diagnosed her with epilepsy and now that her medication is no longer controlling her seizures, I'd like to know what's going on. Besides, over the years, Lindsay and I have developed quite a rapport.
25789	Dr. Cox	Hey Lindsay, what's up girlfriend?
25790	Dr. Cox	See, rapport.
25791	Dr. Kelso	That damned Janitor waxed the counter. Gimme that phone.
25792	Janitor	It doesn't have to be like this.
25793	Dr. Kelso	I know, here.
25794	Janitor	It's beautiful.
25795	Dr. Kelso	Now you don't have to put it on today, but...
25796	J.D.	Hey we're kind of in the middle of something here!
25797	Janitor	This'll just take a second.
25798	Janitor	Nice, huh?
25799	J.D.	Who gets a tattoo of a mop? Can I get up, my butt is asleep.
25800	Turk	NO!
25801	Carla	Turk, you know how I was so upset because you started calling your ex-girlfriend? I just couldn't understand how a married person could slip up like that, now I do. I'm so sorry.
25802	J.D.	Me too buddy.
25803	Turk	Guys, as insane as this may sound I'm actually gonna be OK with this. Just do me a favor, no more apologies and no more explanations and for the love of God, honey, no more girl-on-girl kissing demonstrations.
25804	Todd	Something horrible has happened.
25805	Elliot	Tell you why Lindsay's seizures are back, her blood work shows her Dilantin is at zero. She's not been taking her medicine.
25806	Dr. Cox	What!?! I'm gonna give that girl a serious talking to.
25807	Elliot	With all due respect, Dr. Cox, maybe I should talk to her.
25808	Dr. Cox	With no due respect whatsoever, why?
25809	Elliot	Well she's a teenage girl, that's an awkward time. You know, your breasts are growing... not always symmetrically. Um, you like boys. Maybe one gives you a ride home, you think something's gonna happen but it doesn't and that just makes it official that you're a lop-sided freak. Happy ending though; lefty caught up in college, ha, ha.
25810	Dr. Cox	Barbie! I have a finite amount of brain space and your inspiring story of the little breast who couldn't just pushed out my memory of the 1980 Olympic Hockey team's victory at Lake Placid. Miracle on Ice... gone!
25811	Dr. Cox	Listen to me carefully, I know all about what it's like to be a teenage girl, wah wah wah. Course, I never had to try to convince my mother that I sure would have liked a navel ring.
25812	Elliot	Oh well we were all going to Jamaica and my friend Susan...
25813	Dr. Cox	Brain space.
25814	Carla	Turk, you've been so awesome but we still need you to know how innocent that kiss was.
25815	Turk	Guys, it's cool, don't even worry about it.
25816	J.D.	Just watch buddy.
25817	Carla	See?
25818	Turk	Argh! Get your hands off my woman!
25819	Jordan	Owwww! I think you separated my shoulder, the pain is excruciating.
25820	Turk	What?
25821	Nurse	Looking good Janitor.
25822	Janitor	Well thank you, petite-lady.
25823	Todd	Wow, that colour really brings out your package.
25824	Janitor	Thank you, supposedly-straight-surgeon. It's a good day.
25825	Ted	Hey buddy, that's a great suit.
25826	Janitor	Don't punch the new uni.
25827	Ted	Ha, ha, ha, little boy blue, blow your horn.
25828	Janitor	He didn't stop. Stop! This hallway is closed; you have to find another way around.
25829	J.D.	Whatever. You got something here though.
25830	Janitor	What's that?
25831	J.D.	Well I don't know, you just look so cute in your little blue outfit; I wanted to give you a tickle.
25832	Janitor	Alright, what the hell is going on?
25833	Dr. Cox	Feel free to take notes. Alright there Blossom, here's the hot gossip. You're having seizures again because you're not taking your medication. If this continues, you will be dead... and I'm not talking about the "oh my God, if I don't get invited to the prom I'm going to die" type of dead I'm talking, dead dead. Is that clear enough for you? Because if it's not I could of course text you on my Blackberry, or my Blueberry or my Chuck Berry, although technically Chuck Berry is a black berry. The point is you gotta to stop wasting everybody's time and grow up, is that clear to you sweetheart?
25834	Lindsay	Yes doctor Cox.
25835	Dr. Cox	Atta girl.
25836	Dr. Cox	Barbie! Feel free to kiss my ring.
25837	J.D.'s Narration	It's nice when things get back to normal.
25838	Carla	Hey guys.
25839	J.D. & Turk	Hey.
25840	J.D.	Carla, you gotta try these sweet potato fries, they're amazing!
25841	Carla	Put some ketchup on it.
25842	J.D.	You got it.
25843	Turk	AAAHHHHHHH!!!
25844	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
25845	J.D.'s Narration	Like I said before, small things can knock you on your ass...
25846	J.D.'s Narration continues	Whether it's realizing that no-one's afraid of you anymore...
25847	Janitor	Good lord!
25848	J.D.'s Narration continues	Or finding out that you have no idea how to deal with a teenage girl...
25849	Elliot	Nice work.
25850	J.D.'s Narration continues	The important thing is to not make a scene in the cafeteria.
25851	J.D.	Want another one?
25852	J.D.	AARRGGHH!
25853	Carla	Turk!
25854	Turk	What? What! Were you gonna eat that? How about this, let's all have fries, huh, let's all have fries! You want fries!?!
25855	Carla	Turk, you said you were OK!
25856	J.D.	My fries!
25857	Turk	Well apparently I'm not OK, am I Carla? Apparently I'm not! You know why? Because kisses just don't happen, they don't! Now this is somebody's fault and I wanna know who's? HUH!
25858	Turk	Don't eat that fry!
25859	Turk	I may have lost my cool here.
25860	Carla	No.
25861	J.D.	No Turk, it's understandable.
25862	Turk	I'm sorry. The only way I'm gonna have closure here is if I can blame one of you guys. I just gotta figure out who.
25863	J.D.	Don't worry, this'll all be fine. You know Turk, I mean, whomever he blames will get the silent treatment for a couple of days, then he'll make snarky comments for a few months and then, sooner or later, he'll be laughing about the whole thing. It's just like the time I slept with his family's cleaning lady.
25864	Carla	You slept with Tuni?
25865	J.D.	I was staying in their guest-room & she was buffing the nightstand and she just kept on buffing. But hey, thanks for taking the hit on this one.
25866	Carla	Me? Na-a na-a, you're his best friend, all you have to do is say "I'm sorry", high-five him & go "DAAAAHHHHH!"
25867	J.D.	Oh but all you have to do is have sex with him & he'll forgive you. If I have sex with him he'll probably end up madder.
25868	Carla	You know what; let's not play into his blame game.
25869	J.D.	Agreed.
25870	J.D.	Dude she was pouring drinks into me & she knows I put out when I'm drunk.
25871	Carla	He took me to a bar.
25872	J.D.	DAAAAHHHHH!
25873	Carla	I didn't ask him to walk me home.
25874	J.D.	I'm telling you dude, she was all over me. Like ants on candy.
25875	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
25876	Carla	You think you're talking to Turk, don't you?
25877	Carla	Idiot.
25878	Dr. Cox	Look Lindsay, I'm real sorry if I upset you before, I truly am. I probably should have asked you why you stopped taking your medication and to be honest with you I was, I was hoping you'd be able to give me the answer to that one right about now.
25879	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
25880	Dr. Cox	Sooooo Linz-o, ha h-it must be kind of cool having the same name as that Lindsay Lohan. Gosh, she's super-cool. Just between you, me and the I.V. I guess I've probably seen "Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen" oh, I don't know, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8-9 times ha h- what a film. Whew!
25881	Dr. Cox	That girl, that girl is a robot. I spent 3 hours in there and got goose-egg.
25882	Elliot	That's so odd that she didn't respond to you, because you know sooooo much about teenage girls.
25883	Dr. Cox	Alright, look, Barbie I'm about to say 4 words that I've never said to you before, that I'll never say again.
25884	Dr. Cox	Go on, get out of here!
25885	Dr. Cox	I need your help.
25886	Elliot	Fine, but I have 3 rules. One, when we're in the room you say nothing. Two, I get to say whatever I want about you. And three, if you break rule 1 or 2, I get to boing your curls.
25887	Dr. Cox	What the hell does "boing" mean?
25888	Elliot	Boinnng!
25889	Dr. Cox	Oh God this is gonna kill me.
25890	Janitor's Thoughts	Alright, just put on your mean face and order shall be restored.
25891	Janitor	Yeah hi, nut!
25892	Janitor	What? I don't even know you.
25893	Janitor	Yeah, yeah, happy birthday.
25894	Janitor	You gave me a cursed uniform!
25895	Dr. Kelso	Ha, ha, ha, it's not cursed, its simple psychology. I chose Robin's-Egg blue because it has a calming effect on people & I knew it would be the thorn in your paw. Other colours evoke different reactions, for example bright orange has been found to provoke hostility.
25896	Ted	Doctor Kelso, I wanna thank you again for the tie.
25897	Todd	Fist Five!
25898	Ted	OWW! It's the third time today.
25899	Jordan	Aw, please don't make me go to this banquet tonight.
25900	Dr. Cox	Jordan, this award came from my interns. So the least you can do is show up & support me.
25901	J.D.'s Narration	And just like that it was time for the moment of truth...
25902	J.D. & Carla	Hey Turk!
25903	Turk	'Sup J.D.
25904	Carla	The silent treatment.
25905	J.D.'s Narration	Be gracious.
25906	J.D.	I got 3 words for you; sucks to be, adding a fourth, you .
25907	J.D.'s Narration	After sharing a quick victory dance with Roland, the heavy-set orderly who, coincidentally, was my victory dance coach...
25908	Roland	Pop the hips, pop the hips J.D.
25909	J.D.	OK, there it is. Thanks Roland, one day I'll get it.
25910	Roland	I doubt it.
25911	J.D.'s Narration continues	I got to thinking about relationships, about how people fall in love...
25912	J.D.'s Narration continues	Have kids...
25913	J.D.'s Narration continues	Grow old together...
25914	J.D.'s Narration continues	And say goodbye...
25915	J.D.'s Narration continues	And then for some reason I thought about the circus... but then I was back on relationships...
25916	J.D.	Back to your room Mr. Johnson, you've got one ventricle!
25917	J.D.'s Narration continues	And I couldn't help thinking that maybe it wasn't luck that made relationships last. Maybe it was just a matter of who takes fewer hits...
25918	Carla	You don't have to talk to me, just wave if you're gonna give me a ride home.
25919	J.D.'s Narration continues	And I realized I should have been the one to take that hit, not Carla.
25920	Elliot	Hey Lindsay.
25921	Elliot	Oh, don't worry. He's not allowed to talk.
25922	Lindsay	Is that true?
25923	Elliot	You may nod.
25924	Elliot	Ah, ah. Bup, bup.
25925	Elliot	You know Lindsay when I was 15 I cut my own bangs. Oh that's right Percival; it's a high-school hair story.
25926	Elliot	Anyway, Judy Keenan told me that she would also cut her hair off; it was like a suicide-pact, only with bangs. I cut off my hair and, of course, she backed out. But even though my bangs looked horrible, I kept them that way. Mostly because those stupid bangs were the only thing in my life that I felt I had control over, you know?
25927	Lindsay	I'm so tired of everyone telling me what to do; when to be home, what to wear, when to take my medicine. I mean, I'm the one who's sick, right? I can handle my own life.
25928	Elliot	How 'bout I tell your parents that from now on the prescriptions for your medicine will be given directly to you? You'll be in charge of getting your Dilantin, taking it, everything.
25929	Lindsay	Thank you.
25930	Elliot	Great.
25931	Elliot	I don't have a ring, but you can kiss my ass.
25932	Janitor	Feared in grey? Beautiful in blue? Feared in grey? Beautiful in blue?
25933	Ted	I'm gonna grab a fry, some ketchup. Ah, it's cold.
25934	Janitor	That's it.
25935	Janitor	I'm back!
25936	Turk	That was weird, ha, ha.
25937	Todd	No, that was weird.
25938	Turk	What are you doing?!
25939	J.D.	That was all it was! And if you still need someone to blame, why don't you try blaming yourself?
25940	Turk	You're absolutely right. It's my fault you kissed my wife.
25941	Turk	HI-YAH!
25942	Ted	Aw man, I'm going home.
25943	J.D.	Dude, who do you think you're talking to, you think you've been the World's greatest husband? Please, I was there when you were flirting with your ex-girlfriend & neglected to tell her you were married. I was there when you tried to hook up with that waitress, the day before you got engaged. And I was definitely there when you hooked up with that nasty ass stripper at "Boobies, Boobies, Boobies".
25944	Turk	That wasn't me that was you!
25945	J.D.	I know but I told her my name was Turk. Look the point is, think of the millions of times you chose to not to hang out with your wife, 'cause you were trying to hang out with me. You know, maybe it's time you started acting like a real husband, instead of acting like some sort of crazy... cowboy.
25946	Turk	A cowboy?
25947	J.D.	I don't know, it just came to me.
25948	J.D.	You know I'm right Turk.
25949	J.D.'s Narration	When your pride's at stake, you can't help but have questions...
25950	Dr. Cox	Just tell me, how did you know what was bothering her? Tell me now so that we don't have to talk anymore, ever.
25951	Elliot	How is it that no man understands that every woman, whether she's 16 or 60, still has that awkward, insecure, self-conscious teenage girl inside of her?
25952	J.D.'s Narration continues	A lot of times, the answer is about sacrifice...
25953	Dr. Cox	Hey!
25954	Dr. Cox	Look here, I was thinking maybe, maybe you'd rather just stay in tonight. You know have some pizza watch, watch some movies, what do you say?
25955	Dr. Cox	Are you trying to smile?
25956	Dr. Cox	You're so damned cute.
25957	J.D.'s Narration continues	Sometimes sacrifice is only wearing your new uni when you're not at work...
25958	Janitor	OK how about this one? Three blue-jays fly into a bar & they say, "we just want to wet out beaks". Ha, ha, ha... no? Sorry Dan, you tell one.
25959	J.D.'s Narration continues	Other times, it's about swallowing that damn pride...
25960	Carla	J.D., would you hand me the wine please? Turk's not talking to me.
25961	J.D.'s Narration continues	But ultimately, big or small, sacrifice is about doing something you don't really wanna do.
25962	J.D.	Hey guys, I know we talked about this before but, I'm moving out.
25963	Carla	Really?
25964	J.D.	Man, you guys need your space.
25965	Turk	Wow, thanks man.
25966	J.D.	You're gonna miss me though.
25967	Elliot	Hey, you could turn his room into a gym.
25968	Turk	We ain't putting no gym in my media room.
25969	Carla	Who's media room?
25970	Turk	Our media room.
25971	Carla	Yeah
25972	Turk & Carla	Yeah!
25973	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
25974	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
25975	J.D.'s Narration	One of the reasons Turk and I are so popular around here is that we love helping our fellow doctors.
25976	J.D.	Hey, Hooch!
25977	Hooch	That's my name....don't wear it out.
25978	J.D.	Classic Hooch! Listen, even though I'm not gonna be paid, I'm gonna cover your shift at the clinic tonight so you can do Mr. Schindler's endoscopy.
25979	Turk	And I'm gonna cross-cover all of Dr. Turner's patients so Turner can assist you on the procedure.
25980	Hooch	Why you guys going through so much trouble?
25981	Dr. Kelso	Who's doing the endoscopy on Mr. Schindler?
25982	&	Turner and Hooch!
25983	J.D.	Were you doing Hooch?
25984	Turk	Yeah!
25985	Hooch	Everyone hates you guys.
25986	J.D.	Oh, Hooch!
25987	Turk	Hooch is crazy!
25988	J.D.'s Narration	As much as Hooch loved us, it was even better to see Turk happy. See, he and Carla had recently started couples therapy, and I'm not sure he was enjoying it.
25989	Therapist	Carla says you cry after you orgasm. Would you like to talk about that?
25990	Turk	No, not really.
25991	J.D.'s Narration	I decided to help their marriage by moving out. Partly because Carla and I had accidentally kissed and messed things up, but mostly because it was time. Still, finding an apartment has not been easy.
25992	J.D.	I'm so sorry about your father. I'm sure he lived a wonderful life at... 14 Maple Drive, Apartment 4B. Was he lucky enough to enjoy a washer and dryer in his unit while he was alive?
25993	J.D.	Ever mention any hot neighbors?
25994	J.D.	What are you doing in the on-call room?
25995	Turk	Nothing.
25996	Carla	I gotta go.
25997	Turk	Okay.
25998	J.D.'s Narration	Thankfully, Turk had gotten over the whole kissing incident. Still, there's a weird new thing he does whenever he says goodbye.
25999	Turk	Okay, I'll see you around.
26000	J.D.	Agh! ...Peace, homey!
26001	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26002	Elliot	Uh, do you guys think that Clarissa is more attractive than me?
26003	Dr. Cox	Yes.
26004	Dr. Cox	Who's Clarissa?
26005	Elliot	She's the short, balding woman in the pharmacy.
26006	Dr. Cox	Oh, then definitely yes.
26007	Elliot	She just got engaged. Bad comb-over and all!
26008	Carla	When Clarissa beats you to the altar, it might be time to hang up the ovaries.
26009	Elliot	Too mean!
26010	Carla	Are the guys here really that bad?
26011	Ted	Twelve minutes door-to-door! That's a personal best, sucko! Agh!
26012	Todd	Nurse, suction.
26013	Nurse	The patient's not even here yet.
26014	Todd	I know.
26015	Elliot	I just wish once a cute, thoughtful guy would walk through the door.
26016	Jake	Hi. I need some help. My neighbor fainted and she doesn't like ambulances, so I brought her in myself.
26017	Elliot	Let me take this one, Jenny, you've got a phone call.
26018	Jenny	Uh, I'll call them back.
26019	Elliot	Your mom died.
26020	Jenny	WHAT?!
26021	Elliot	Her mom's fine. It's just a little running joke we have. She'll be laughing later. Got you, Jenny!
26022	Elliot	Dead mom jokes always funny. Heh.
26023	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26024	J.D.	So, Betty, you're back with us. And I see you brought a young, handsome buck with ya. What are you, trying to make me jealous? You know you're my gal!
26025	Betty	Who are you?
26026	J.D.	I'm Dr. Dorian. Uh, I'm the one that's taken care of you the last nineteen times you've been in here. She's getting a little forgetful you know how that happens. Are you a relative?
26027	Jake	Uh, no, neighbor. I only met her once.
26028	Betty	It was raining, and you were wearing a blue sweater!
26029	J.D.	That's a lovely memory, Betty. You know what else is a lovely memory that Sunday I spent eight hours helping you join the Wilford Brimley fan club. You don't remember that, do ya.
26030	Jake	If everything's all right here, I'm kind of on my way to the airport. I'm going kayaking with some friends in New Zealand.
26031	Elliot	Cool! So, what are you gonna do there?
26032	Jake	Mostly kayaking.
26033	Elliot	Ohhh.
26034	Jake	So, uh, Betty, I'll check on you the second I get back, okay? You get better, now!
26035	J.D.	So Elliot, the first thing we're gonna need to do is....
26036	Betty	Is Dr. Reid coming back?
26037	J.D.	Oh, don't worry about her, Betty, you're in good hands with Dr. Dorian.
26038	Betty	Who's that?
26039	J.D.	That's me! Betty, Dr. Dorian. 'Cocoon'. Wilford Brimley. Steve Guttenberg. The whole day. No?
26040	Elliot	Hey, Jake. Heh. So, uh, you're probably rushing home to wipe the old person smell off before your trip, huh?
26041	Jake	Excuse me?
26042	Elliot	No , I'm just kidding. I love old people. Still, there's no denying they have a distinctive smell. I mean, it's nothing bad, it's like a...general mustiness.... Like, you know, when you get your cast taken off and...skin mold....
26043	Jake	Well, I got a flight to catch. You guys need me to sign anything?
26044	Dr. Cox	Nah.
26045	Carla	No, you're good.
26046	Jake	Okay, then.
26047	Dr. Cox	Hat's off, there, Barbie. That was one potent combination of verbal diarrhea and stunned silence.
26048	Carla	You should've just asked him out men love that.
26049	Dr. Cox	No, Carla, men don't love that. It turns out we don't love picnics, foreplay, candles, baths, photo albums, or when you drive so that we can relax, and as always we're not that big on Hugh Jackman. Lookit, the only thing men actually care about as far as dating is concerned is The Chase. If you want that guy to look your way, listen to me carefully, ignore the living hell out of him.
26050	Carla	That's the worst advice I've ever heard!
26051	Dr. Cox	Good point, Carla. Say, you don't happen to have any other gems you wanna lay on us before you run off to couples therapy to sift through the wreckage that is the first year of your marriage, do ya?
26052	Elliot	Look, Dr. Cox, I'm sure that you are fantastic at picking up men, really
26053	Elliot	but I can handle this one on my own, thank you.
26054	Elliot	Ow! Some people just cannot take a good "your mom's dead" joke, you know?
26055	Dr. Cox	Ah.
26056	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26057	Carla	Anyway, I worry that sometimes when I'm tense, I could be a little condescending.
26058	Therapist	Actually, I've noticed that.
26059	Carla	Have you really noticed it, Mr. Therapist?
26060	Therapist	Chris. What's going on with you?
26061	Turk	Nothing worth talking about.
26062	Therapist	This is your third visit, and you've yet to say anything real about how you're feeling.
26063	Turk	That's because I don't think there's anything wrong with our relationship.
26064	Therapist	I think you pretend that everything's okay even though, deep down inside, a lot of things are bothering you. So, come on, tell me what you're thinking right now.
26065	Turk	I'm staring at that picture above your head. Yeah, now, is that one of those psychological ink-blot tests where I try and figure out what it is? Because if so, I'm seeing a duck.
26066	Therapist	Let's take a break.
26067	Carla	Yeah.
26068	Turk	Okay.
26069	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26070	Dr. Turner	But Hooch, if the patient just has simple cellulitis, why aren't the antibiotics working?
26071	Hooch	Dammit, Turner! It just doesn't make sense!
26072	J.D.'s Narration	Even though I had created a super medical crime-fighting team, I felt lousy. See, I had just told Betty that her lungs had finally given out and she wasn't gonna leave the hospital this time.
26073	Betty	So...what are my choices?
26074	J.D.	Well, we could put you on a breathing machine, but it's unlikely you'd ever come off of it. Or I could just make sure you're as comfortable as possible.
26075	J.D.'s Thoughts	"As comfortable as possible." I've said that a million times and I still have no idea what it means.
26076	J.D.	There you go, Betty! That's every cotton ball in the hospital!
26077	Betty	Ohhh! I am very, very comfortable!
26078	J.D.	Then you're ready to die.
26079	J.D.	Look, Betty, is there anyone you'd like to talk this over with?
26080	J.D.	She just wants to talk to you for a minute.
26081	Jake	Yeah? About what?
26082	J.D.	Just about how and when she should die.
26083	Jake	Oh, that's not a problem. I counsel most of my random neighbors on their deathbeds.
26084	J.D.	Look, this woman is alone, she's depressed, and for some reason she feels like she's connected with you.
26085	Jake	Look, I'm sorry, but I wouldn't know what to say.
26086	J.D.	That's great! Keep it light! Open with a joke, and before you know it you and your raft will be on a four-hour trip to New Zealand!
26087	Jake	No, it's more like fourteen hours.
26088	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh no. You're dangerously close to revealing that geography is your Achilles heel. Say something smart to regain credibility.
26089	J.D.	Vasovagal syncope is mediated by the autonomic nervous system. And Betty needs you, pal. She does! Come on, do it. You'll feel good, trust me.
26090	Jake	Trust you? You don't even know where New Zealand is.
26091	J.D.	You can dance your way there from Old Zealand.
26092	Jake	You an idiot?
26093	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26094	Janitor	Elliot. My neighbor fainted too! Hey, you wanna go clubbing tonight? And I don't mean dancing I mean going up to the roof and killing rats.
26095	Elliot	Janitor. I thought we were done with this?
26096	Janitor	I know. Thought I'd give it a shot.
26097	Elliot	Ugh. Just...put her back in her room.
26098	Janitor	She's not a patient. I got her at the mall!
26099	Elliot's Thoughts	Oh my God, here he comes. Okay, this is easy, just compliment him tell him he has a square head. That's not a compliment! What shape is a compliment? Triangle? Uh, pyramid? Circle! Circle head! Oh my God, you're stuck on shapes and Square-Head's almost here! To hell with it, just do what Dr. Cox said and ignore him.
26100	Jake	Hey, Elliot.
26101	Elliot	Mm.
26102	Jake	So that girl's kinda cute, what's her story?
26103	J.D.	She's a dude.
26104	Jake	Nuh-uh.
26105	J.D.	Gotta look at the Adam's apple, buddy.
26106	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26107	Turk	Couples therapy is killing me.
26108	Todd	I don't know how you do it make love with your lady in front of some old dude who's filming you?
26109	Turk	That's not couples therapy, Todd.
26110	Todd	Then what did I do?
26111	Turk	You did amateur porn!
26112	Todd	Sweet!
26113	Turk	J.D., you got a sec?
26114	J.D.	Sure.
26115	Jake	Okay.
26116	Turk	So check this out: Our therapist says I'm the type of guy who pretends everything's okay even when I'm upset deep down inside.
26117	J.D.	Well, I think that's true. I mean, if you look at the whole Carla kissing thing, I think intellectually you moved on, but emotionally you're still upset. You'll get there, though, pal.
26118	Turk	I'm not upset!
26119	J.D.	Really? Oh, okay. I'll see you later. Bye.
26120	J.D.	Ow! You see!
26121	Turk	See what?
26122	J.D.	Let's try it again. I'll see you later, buddy. Bye!
26123	Turk	Bye.
26124	J.D.	OW! Always the same spot! It's like your fingers are stone!
26125	Last time	I'll see you later. Buh Hey! Look at yourself!
26126	Turk	I've been hitting you.
26127	J.D.	Yeah, you're like the brown Hulk.
26128	J.D.	Hey. How's it going in here, you two?
26129	Jake	Oh, pretty good. Pretty good. We, uh, we talked about her past. Betty even let me in on a few of her romantic trysts from her younger days you familiar with Mr. David Brinkley?
26130	J.D.	No way!
26131	Jake	Yeah.
26132	Betty	Betty!
26133	Jake	And when we finally got down to talking for real, well, it became pretty obvious that...Betty had already made a decision.
26134	J.D.	Okay.
26135	Narration	The thing that impressed me most about Jake besides his perfectly square head was that he faced this whole Betty thing straight on.
26136	Elliot	He thinks I'm cute. He thinks I'm cah-yute. He thinks I'm cute, he thinks I'm cute, he thinks I'm cute...
26137	J.D.'s Narration	...He didn't hide because he was afraid to admit someone was right...
26138	Elliot	...I'm cute.
26139	Dr. Cox	Barbie? Why so happy?
26140	Elliot	No reason.
26141	J.D.'s Narration	...He didn't run because he was scared of facing his own feelings...
26142	Turk	Baby, I'm not gonna be able to make therapy tonight. I got surgery.
26143	Carla	Fine.
26144	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, he wouldn't've been able to do it if it weren't for his secret weapon...
26145	J.D.	Dr. John Dorian.
26146	Jake	What?
26147	J.D.	Wha?
26148	Jake	You just said your name in a weird kinda summing-up way.
26149	J.D.	No I didn't, Jake.
26150	Dennis	Ah, so you're Jake! Uh, as I understand it, you just talked my sister into ending her life. Long story short: I'm a lawyer, I'm suing you. Once again: Sister dying, brother lawyer, suing you!
26151	J.D.	See, that's summing up in a weird way.
26152	Jake	Yeah.
26153	J.D.	"Brother lawyer." That's it.
26154	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26155	Jake	I can't believe this is happening.
26156	J.D.	Everything's gonna be fine, you just trust me.
26157	Ted	Is that him?
26158	J.D.	Yes. Here's Ted, our brilliant hospital attorney. Sharp as a tack.
26159	Ted	Mark my words, Jake! We're gonna take every last cent you have!
26160	J.D.	No, no, Ted, we're on his side.
26161	Ted	Oh. Here's my card.
26162	Jake	This is a post-it.
26163	Ted	I don't get real cards until I win a case.
26164	J.D.	Go take a nap, Ted.
26165	Jake	He spelled "attorney" wrong.
26166	J.D.	"Buy Groceries. Kill Self."
26167	Jake	Just admit it you're just here from the future to destroy me.
26168	J.D.	I am not from the future, Jake!
26169	J.D.	Yes! It finally worked! What are the odds?
26170	Jake	I don't know what the odds are, J.D., but what I do know is I'm about to go down to my truck, get my kayak paddle, and go Greg Barton on your ass.
26171	J.D.	Who's Greg Barton?
26172	Jake	He's a famous kayaker.
26173	J.D.	Oh, Greg Barton!
26174	Jake	I hate you, J.D.
26175	J.D.	I know.
26176	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26177	Elliot	Dr. Cox, this is the most painful thing I've ever done, and I was a cutter for a week in high school my shop teacher thought scars were sexy, but that is a whole other story. The point is your advice really worked with Jake, and I'd really appreciate it if you'd give me some more help.
26178	Dr. Cox	Oh, no problem Barbie. Let me just finish writing this, uh, prescription. You'll be all squared away.
26179	Elliot	This a prescription for "no."
26180	Dr. Cox	Correctomundo. It's to be taken with food every Saturday night while you're eating alone.
26181	Elliot	I don't think you understand the severity of the situation here! I am dangerously close to giving up men altogether!
26182	Dr. Cox	And on behalf of men everywhere and I do mean everywhere, including the ones in the little mud huts let me be the first to say thanks and alleluia!
26183	Carla	Elliot, do you see the problem with trying to appeal to its human side?
26184	Elliot	He doesn't have one.
26185	Carla	Exactly! But what does he have?
26186	Elliot	A shaved chest, a closetful of tiny tee shirts, and the eyes of a madman.
26187	Dr. Cox	OHHHH! I'm sorry! The correct answer she was looking for is "a giant ego"! I have a giant ego!
26188	Elliot	Dammit! I knew that!
26189	Carla	Would you just appeal to it so I can go get something to eat?
26190	Elliot	You're...amazing.
26191	Dr. Cox	And I'm in!
26192	Elliot	Oh! Ah!
26193	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26194	J.D.	Dr. Kelso, you can't do that.
26195	Dr. Kelso	I didn't. Your friend Turkleton did. And I can do whatever I want. You look ridiculous.
26196	Turk	I thought we were doing mustaches on Sunday?
26197	J.D.	I didn't do this, Kelso did!
26198	Turk	You invited Kelso to Mustache Sunday?
26199	J.D.	Enough with the mustaches, dude! Are you responsible for breaking up Turner and Hooch?
26200	Turk	I need an excuse to get out of couples counseling. Dude, I can't open up, man, I just can't do it. Besides, this way no one gets hurt.
26201	Dr. Turner	We had a hell of a run, man.
26202	Hooch	Just get outta here.
26203	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26204	Jake	Well, maybe I should just go talk to him.
26205	J.D.	Forget Dennis, he's a horrible person, okay? We'll never be able to change his mind. We need to focus on Betty, okay? We'll just have her explain how she feels, problem solved. Betty's in a coma. You know what? I'm gonna talk to Dennis he seems like a reasonable guy.
26206	Elliot	Hey, Jake. How's it goin'?
26207	Jake	Oh, heh, I've had better days. How are you?
26208	Dr. Cox	Listen to me, Barbacious, you gotta stay the course here. You gotta keep ignoring him.
26209	Elliot	But I am already ignoring him. How do I ignore him more?
26210	Dr. Cox	Aha. Piece of cake. First you engage him, then you ignore him.
26211	Jake	Elliot? I said, How are you?
26212	Elliot	I actually don't have time for this, okay? I'm a doctor!
26213	Jake	But you asked me how I was.
26214	Elliot	Yeah, trying to save lives here. It's not always about you!
26215	Jake	Buddy, you would not believe the day I'm having.
26216	Janitor	Quiet, jackass. What'd you say to Elliot to make her run off like that? 'Cause if you hurt her....
26217	Jake	I didn't say anything! Everyone around here is crazy.
26218	Janitor	That's not true. Let me put down my bag of rats and explain something to you....
26219	Jake	Bag of rats? Those alive?
26220	Janitor	Most of 'em are. I put a dead one in the middle, that way all the live ones get a good look at him, they start toeing that line. Know what I'm saying?
26221	Jake	I very much don't.
26222	Janitor	Pretty simple. Take a canvas bag....
26223	Janitor	Jailbreak!
26224	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26225	J.D.	Look, you're gonna do whatever you want with your sister, but Jake's just trying to help. He's a stand-up guy, I think you should leave him alone. If you do, I think it would be dy-no-mite! Sorry, I was just watching 'Good Times' in the doctors' lounge.
26226	Dennis	Yeah. I'm gonna screw him to the wall.
26227	J.D.	Can you believe this guy?
26228	Dr. Kelso	Son, look around. There's an old man with Alzheimer's who no one bothers to come visit. This morning I had a chat with a woman who refuses to stop using cocaine even though she's six months pregnant. And just last week I saw an older woman fall and break her hip because some guy was too busy to hold the door open for her!
26229	J.D.	Sir, you laughed and pointed when she fell.
26230	Dr. Kelso	I didn't say it wasn't funny; I just said it happened. Come on, when's the last time you saw a glimpse of humanity in this place.
26231	J.D.'s Narration	Kelso had a point. I mean, in the outside world you'll occasionally see a stream of cars drive by an old woman with a flat tire. But around here, every time you round a corner, well...
26232	Husband	She fell again.
26233	J.D.'s Narration	...Anyway, I knew what I had to do.
26234	J.D.	Just go, Jake! No one here knows your last name if anything happens, he'll never be able to find you. Go enjoy your little rafting thing in New Zealand which, incidentally, is ten thousand miles east of Australia, and famous for alcoholism and clam chowder. I've been brushing up on my New Zealand.
26235	Jake	You've been brushing up on New England.
26236	J.D.	Oh. Well go, anyway, wherever it is you're rafting.
26237	Dr. Cox	Where's he going?
26238	J.D.	He just left!
26239	Dr. Cox	Barbie. Go get him! I...believe in you?
26240	Elliot	Nnnno, you don't. You just want me to go and embarrass myself so you can laugh at me! Just like the time you told me the hospital fund-raiser was a costume party! I walked into a black-tie dinner dressed as Clarence Thomas....
26241	Dr. Cox	I was in a costume, too.
26242	Elliot	You...wore an Armani tux.
26243	Dr. Cox	I went as someone who doesn't make a fool out of himself. How'd you not get that?
26244	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26245	Dennis	Thank you.
26246	Dr. Kelso	Hey! I personally see to it that every inch of this building is up to the highest standards and codes!
26247	Dr. Kelso	Well, that's just bad timing!
26248	Janitor	Come back here!
26249	Janitor	Come on, fellas!
26250	J.D.'s Narration	And then something surprising happened.
26251	Dennis	Well, look who's back.
26252	Jake	Look, buddy, I, uh, I barely know your sister, and I certainly don't know you, but like it or not, she told me what she wanted and I'm gonna honor that. Anyway, I'm gonna go ahead and stay here 'til I can figure out a way to make you understand that, even if I have to get myself a lawyer.
26253	Jake	Not you.
26254	Janitor	They're smart, they are organized...and they've got my keys!
26255	J.D.'s Narration	It's amazing how a selfless gesture can affect so many people.
26256	Turk	I've got something I'd like to share today.
26257	Carla	Really?
26258	Turk	Yeah.
26259	J.D.'s Narration	One man was pushed to make the right decision.
26260	Dennis	Just make her as comfortable as possible.
26261	J.D.'s Narration	And another man realized it's okay to be a decent human being for once.
26262	Dr. Cox	Well, he's definitely leaving for good this time, there, Barbie. I'd, uh, I say go for it.
26263	Elliot	Why won't you leave me alone?
26264	Dr. Cox	Oh, I don't know.... Maybe because the NHL is on strike and I'm not getting my fill of toothless men knocking the hell out of each other. Or, maybe because for the first time in four years I'd actually like to see you happy for a change. You believe whatever you want, I don't really care. Jake the Snake is bearing down on you, and if I were you, I'd step up to him, look him straight in the eye with those beautiful blues, and...invite him out for a cup of coffee before he escapes.
26265	Elliot	Hey, um...can I buy you a cup of coffee before you escape?
26266	Jake	What, now?
26267	Elliot	I me I mean "go"?
26268	Jake	Yeah, that'd be nice.
26269	Elliot	Great.
26270	Dr. Cox	That's a cute couple. I give 'em a week.
26271	Janitor	I can make sure of that.
26272	Dr. Cox	No, thanks.
26273	Elliot	Oh, congratulations, Clarissa!
26274	J.D.'s Narration	As for me, seeing Jake come back and do the right thing restored my faith in humanity.
26275	Lady	I can't believe that six young men stopped to help an old lady change a tire!
26276	J.D.	And don't you forget who put that tire on and tightened those lugnuts, Martha! Okay, sweetie, have fun at the swap-meet! Drive safe.
26277	J.D.'s Narration	Yep. It sure feels good to do the right thing.
26278	J.D.	Righty loosey, lefty tighty.
26279	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, "righty tighty! lefty loosey!" Ohhhh, man. It still feels good.
26280	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26281	J.D.'s Narration	No one wants to live out their last years in a hospital, but people do. There's really not much we can do for them except try to protect their dignity. And, of course, bet on them.
26282	J.D.	Come on, Mr. Gilmore.
26283	Turk	Come on, Colonel Mustard!
26284	Turk	HA! Pay up.
26285	Mr. Gilmore	Can I get some Jell-O, please?
26286	J.D.	Jello-O is for winners.
26287	Mr. Gilmore	What?
26288	J.D.	I'm just kidding. We'll have some sent right to your room, big guy.
26289	Mr. Gilmore	Thank you.
26290	J.D.	Dude, you're not gonna believe how much trouble I'm having finding a place to live.
26291	Turk	What happened with that little guest house you went to see?
26292	Realtor	It's fully furnished, and the owner of the main house is just great. In fact, if you look out the window, you can see him right now.
26293	Owner	Ohh, he's perfect.
26294	J.D.	Perfect for what?
26295	J.D.	Yeah, I think I'm gonna keep looking.
26296	J.D.'s Narration	Things were going better for Elliot.
26297	Elliot	Thanks for the movie.
26298	Jake	You're welcome for the movie.
26299	J.D.'s Narration	For some reason, Jake was able to handle the piping hot giant bowl of crazy that is Elliot Reid.
26300	Elliot	Oh God.
26301	Jake	What is it?
26302	Elliot	I just locked the door when a black guy walked by. Now he's gonna think that I think he's dangerous 'cause he's black; and not just black, but with an actual 'fro and everything which, trust me, I don't find scary at all. Not like the zigzags and the cornrows and stuff. My life's ruined!
26303	Jake	No it isn't.
26304	Jake	Hey, did you think she was locking the door 'cause you're black?
26305	Black Guy	No. I just thought she was locking the door.
26306	Jake	Thanks, man.
26307	Jake	Better?
26308	Elliot	Coolio! Let's go get some ice cream!
26309	J.D.'s Narration	Unfortunately for Jake, he still had to pass muster with Turk and me. And nothing is quite as daunting as our "good guy test."
26310	J.D.	Well, I could use a beer.
26311	Jake	I got this round. Be right back.
26312	J.D.	Good guy.
26313	Turk	Great guy.
26314	J.D.	Yeah.
26315	Turk	Oh, my God!
26316	J.D.	Excellent choice.
26317	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26318	Janitor	Aaaand finished. I remember the bordello being a little bit bigger and there were probably a few more prostitutes, but maybe I just remember it that way 'cause I was a kid it was my twelfth birthday. I asked for a bike. I got a 48-year-old whore.
26319	Doug	It's beautiful. It's almost a shame I get these casts off in a week.
26320	Janitor	A month.
26321	Doug	A what?
26322	Janitor	Yeah, I worked too hard on this you can take 'em off in a month.
26323	Doug	I'll call my orthopedist.
26324	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Murphy, I'd have more sympathy if this were the first time you broke both your feet working in the morgue.
26325	Doug	Sir, it's like those corpses are out to get me!
26326	Dr. Kelso	Heh! If only. Anyway, uh, I need you to give up this thing . No offense, son, but I can't have a delusional bozo like you driving a motorized vehicle around this hospital.
26327	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26328	J.D.	What are you doing?
26329	Ted	Dr. Kelso told me to stand here at exactly 12:05 with my lunch, but I don't know why.
26330	Dr. Kelso	Thanks, Ted!
26331	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26332	Dr. Cox	All right, everybody! Gather around here, circle it up, will ya? Bring it in nice and tight. Look, I know I'm pretty quick to point out other people's mistakes but...I have a son now, and I also realize that it's important to recognize when someone does something right. Mr. Blake down in Bed 3 came in here with what seemed like a basic heart block. But someone took the time to find out that recently he'd been camping and correctly diagnosed him with Lyme Carditis. Now, I'm sure some of your are gonna think this is a silly exercise, but I'd like that someone to step forward and stick your hand up in the air so that the group can recognize your great good work. This this is no time to be modest. Come now.
26333	Dr. Cox	Oh! My God! It was me! I did it, I'm a genius, I'm a huge brain in a ripped up body, I am Jesus H. Cox...M.D.
26334	Lonnie	That's me, daddy.
26335	J.D.	Put your hand down, Lonnie.
26336	Dr. Cox	And then there was the resident who confirmed that misdiagnosis.
26337	J.D.	In my defense, I was up late watching a 'Designing Women' marathon.
26338	Dr. Cox	And, last but not least, there was the surgeon who wanted to crack open Mr. Blake's chest like a walnut and put in a pacemaker that he didn't even need. Now, he's too modest to introduce himself to the group, so I'll do the honors. He is so black, so bald, and he can't eat cupcakes because he's got diabetes. Ladies and gentlemen, Chris Turk!
26339	Turk	Can you just get out of here so we can get back to work?
26340	Dr. Cox	Not until people start chanting my name so that I can exit the room with my hands held high above my head in a victorious gesture. Capisce? You see, this diagnosing machine, this fabulous thing? Well, it runs on props, so I'm going to need to hear it. Come now.
26341	Group	Cox...Cox...Cox...Cox...Cox...Cox....
26342	Dr. Cox	Me. Me. Me. Oh, so me!
26343	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26344	Elliot	I've never connected with a guy like this before. I mean, even though it's only been two weeks, I already feel like I know Jake better than I know myself.
26345	Carla	What does he do for a living?
26346	Elliot	I should know that.
26347	Turk	What's the sex like?
26348	Elliot	What makes you think that I have slept with him?
26349	Dr. Kelso	For starters, you've known him more than ten minutes.
26350	Elliot	You are a weird and angry man!
26351	&	Two bits.
26352	Elliot	Look, I have just been thinking about all of my relationships, and every time one has potential, I go too fast and ruin everything. Long story short, Jake's not getting any.
26353	J.D.	Oh, please, you're a half a glass of wine away from nuding up and doing your go-to move.
26354	Turk	Which is?
26355	J.D.	Her on top, eyes closed, yelling, "Don't look at me! Don't look at me!"
26356	Elliot	Sex is disgusting!
26357	Carla	I know, sweetie.
26358	Elliot	Look...I am attracted to Jake, but I'm an adult. I can control my urges.
26359	Elliot	No means no!
26360	Jake	'Night, Elliot!
26361	Elliot	Goodnight, Jake!

26363	Dr. Kelso	I'll check back with you after I look in on a few other patients!

26366	Janitor	Four, please.
26367	Dr. Kelso	Try not to breathe on the chrome, Lurch.

26374	Taco Guy	One second.

26376	Dr. Cox	I eat here all the time.
26377	Turk	Ah, yeah.
26378	Dr. Cox	Guy's choking!
26379	Dr. Cox	I can't clear his airway. Call 9-1-1! Let's go!
26380	Turk	He'll be brain-dead by the time they get here
26381	Dr. Cox	Come on!
26382	Turk	I'm gonna do an emergency trach. Lemme get a knife!
26383	Turk	A clean knife!
26384	Dr. Cox	Hey now, great work back there, Gandhi. What a story, huh? Blood, bravery, illegal immigrants it had it all. Hell, when you tell Carla about this, the next time you two have sex, there's a slight chance that she actually just might think about you.
26385	Turk	Heh! Perry, Perry, Perry. You know what the difference between us is? Well, besides the fact that I can carry a conversation without checking my own reflection every five seconds?
26386	Dr. Cox	I'm sorry. I I get lost in my eyes.
26387	Turk	Anyway, I'm not gonna tell anyone about this because, unlike you
26388	Turk	unlike you, I got in medicine to help people, not for my own personal glory.
26389	Dr. Cox	Yeah, now that's just a load of crap. Turns out the only reason anybody ever does anything is to feed the ego. Because that's what we are ego monsters. Mark my words: eventually you will tell people what'cha did.
26390	Turk	Yeah, we'll see.
26391	Dr. Cox	Yeah, we'll see.
26392	Turk	Yeah, we will see.
26393	Dr. Cox	We will so see.
26394	Turk	You wanna call it?
26395	Dr. Cox	That's a pretty good idea.
26396	Turk	See you later.

26398	Elliot	I don't know how much longer I can avoid sleeping with Jake, man.
26399	Carla	You know, like how you can swallow your whole fist.
26400	Elliot	Huh!
26401	Guys	No way! She can't do that! Nooo!
26402	J.D.	Calm down, boys. Let me just ask.
26403	J.D.	Can you really swallow your whole fist?
26404	Elliot	Yeah.
26405	Guys	Ohhhhhhhhhhhh.
26406	J.D.	Shhh. Don't ruin it.
26407	Carla	Men are twisted.
26408	Elliot	Do you guys have any other ideas?
26409	J.D.	You know what, I really don't have time to be dealing with your little sex pickle.
26410	Dr. Kelso	Really? She spent two years dealing with yours.
26411	Carla	Ha!
26412	J.D.	I hate that thing.
26413	Janitor	Sir, you probably haven't noticed this, but the floors around here are so clean you can see yourself in them.
26414	Dr. Cox	Huh! Why, you handsome son of a gun!
26415	Janitor	I know we haven't care of that whole asbestos thing from the '90s, and I know some toilets flush upward...
26416	Dr. Kelso	Get to the point. My battery power's running low.
26417	Janitor	The one thing that I'm proud of is that these floors are so clean you could eat off of 'em.
26418	Dr. Kelso	Why is that?
26419	Janitor's Mom	If you're going to throw food on the floor, you can just eat there from now on.
26420	Janitor	Soup night was the worst.
26421	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26422	Dr. Cox	All righty! Point-proving time. Carla, I assume tubby hubby here told you all about what happened at the taco stand?
26423	Carla	Please, tell me you didn't try to get free guacamole again by telling them you were married to one of their people.
26424	Turk	No, I did not! Because I don't have the need to make everything about me. See, I'm not that pathetic.
26425	Carla	So what did happen at the taco stand?
26426	J.D.'s Narration	There are certain people in life who know how to push your buttons.
26427	Dr. Cox	Well, the guy started choking, so naturally I sprung into action and gave him an emergency trach.
26428	Dr. Cox	Yeah.
26429	J.D.'s Narration	So it's important to have a plan to deal with it. Even if it means never being alone with someone.
26430	Jake	Wow, this 'Body Heats a sexy movie, huh?
26431	J.D.	Mmm. Doesn't Kathleen Turner have dynamite nerps?
26432	Elliot	Yeah.
26433	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, if that person is stubborn, there's not much you can do.
26434	Dr. Kelso	Yeah, I'm sorry, son, I'd love to help you out, but I could give a horse's patootie about your floors.
26435	Janitor	My floors are my children! I'VE GIVEN THEM NAMES!
26436	J.D.'s Narration	The key is to figure out a way to not let them get the best of you.
26437	Dr. Cox	Honestly, it was like Death and I had a staring match, and, well, Death blinked. Now, all of you know I'm not one to toot my own horn, but, uh...beep, beep.
26438	Turk	Okay, that's it! That's it! I can't take this anymore! That's it! I saved the guy, people! Death blinked at me! You got that? He blinked at me! Okay?
26439	Dr. Cox	Yeah-ha-ha-ha!
26440	Dr. Cox	Ohh, doesn't that feel so much better? I'm so proud of you! Well struck! So well struck! Yes!
26441	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26442	Dr. Cox	And it's just the way I called it! Grampa Goatee to win, Pee-Pants to place, and Wrong-Way Wally not to finish!
26443	Carla	He does have glaucoma.
26444	Jordan	Well, I should have been told that!
26445	Dr. Cox	Wouldn't have mattered, Jordan. You know why? Because I am always right. It's something my...my old pal, Gandhi here, knows a little something about, because, you see, we are both egotistical peas in a giant narcissistic pod. And, to prove my point, I'm gonna go ahead and make a......unnecessarily showy but undeniably impressive exit. Rope time, Gandhi.
26446	Dr. Cox	Feel it. I'll see ya later.
26447	Jordan	I would so mock him right now if I wasn't so turned on!
26448	Turk	I'm not like that, am I?
26449	Carla	Actually, Turk, you are slightly Coxish. Yeah! I mean, the way you do that stupid victory dance every time you win the slightest argument?
26450	Turk	No I don't!
26451	Carla	Maybe not. Heh. You know, Turk, you were right! Next year is not a leap year!
26452	Turk	Dammit!

26454	Elliot	Thanks for giving me a ride to work. I hope you didn't mind J.D. tagging along.

26456	J.D.	Well, maybe next time she'll yell "shotgun" a little faster!
26457	Elliot	Bye.
26458	Jake	Bye.
26459	Carla	Elliot, you can't keep taking J.D. everywhere you go. Sooner or later, you're gonna have to trust yourself.
26460	Elliot	No, I won't, Carla. This system is working. Trust me, heh, I will not be having sex with Jake anytime soon!
26461	Jake	That seems like a...a strange thing to announce to your friends.
26462	Elliot	Oh....
26463	Jake	Just came back to get my keys.
26464	J.D.'s Thoughts	This is so awkward. Look away. Look away!

26471	Janitor	I did not!
26472	Dr. Kelso	You've got green paint on your face!
26473	Janitor	I do nn Well, that's not paint, that's...pudding. You know what, even if this was the Rascal you were riding around, you can't prove anything. And it's no good to hide it from me, 'cause I got keys to everything. Except the third floor mental ward. Someone stole that one.

26477	Mr. Hoffner	Why do I have to have my gallbladder taken out?
26478	Dr. Cox	Because, Mr. Hoffner, you have gallstones.
26479	Mr. Hoffner	Why do I have gallstones?
26480	Dr. Cox	Did you possibly eat a large gall-boulder and then fall on your stomach?
26481	Mr. Hoffner	Do I need my gallbladder?
26482	Dr. Cox	Oh my God, it is a completely useless organ. Oh, wait a minute, that's not completely true. Here, it turns out, we could remove it and then jam it in your mouth to keep you from asking the same question we've been going over for three straight days. Now, come on, we're both in a position to get some good news here: You're gonna feel better, and I'm gonna get the world's most annoying patient the hell out of my hair. Plus, you're in a bonus situation I hand-picked the surgeon that you're going to be torturing. Here he is now.
26483	Turk	Is this the gallbladder guy?

26492	J.D.	Two is your current boyfriend!
26493	Jake	Hello?

26497	Mr. Hoffner	So, uh, are you a good surgeon?
26498	Turk	I'm capable.
26499	Mr. Hoffner	"Capable." I'm not sure I want I want the surgery.
26500	Dr. Cox	Gandhi? A word?
26501	Dr. Cox	Lookit, I know what you're doing in there. You think that if you act like Dr. Sad Sack that the patient's gonna opt out of surgery and I'll have to spend yet another week with a man who has such an unnatural attachment to his gallbladder that, left to his own devices, he would rent a motel room and have sex with it. Now come on, I need you to sling that "I'm gonna get freaky-deeky with my chizzle and and slizzle up the dizzle for my...bee-aye...yitch" stuff that, you know, you do so well.
26502	Turk	Sorry, I'm not that guy anymore.

26504	Dr. Cox	Oh...dear...Lord...
26505	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26506	Elliot	Look, the reason I've been acting so weird and having my friends hang around us all the time is because I really think that we have a shot for something great, and I don't wanna go and ruin it by sleeping with you too fast. I mean, what was I supposed to do?
26507	Jake	Well, you...you could have just told me that.
26508	Elliot	Yes, but you're forgetting I'm a crazy person!
26509	Jake	Elliot, please, look, everybody has their stuff. 'Kay, like me. I'm an emotional person, but I've always had trouble expressing it. Well, here, tell me...tell me you like my shirt.
26510	Elliot	I like your shirt.
26511	Jake	Cool.
26512	Elliot	Uh, Buster's coming home.
26513	Jake	Cool.
26514	Jake	See, there's no difference, and Buster meant the world to me. I really like you, Elliot, but I'm an adult. I want this to be an adult relationship. If you wanna be patient and not have sex right away, then that's fine. 'Cause I think we have a chance for something great, too.
26515	Elliot	I want you so bad right now.

26520	Dr. Kelso	What were you doing?
26521	Janitor	Sleeping in a mop closet.
26522	Dr. Kelso	You forced me to do this! Either we figure out a way to share the Rascal, or neither one of us gets it. Your move. You've got about eight seconds before this thing becomes a pile of rubble.
26523	Dr. Kelso	Five seconds.
26524	Janitor	I doubt it.
26525	Dr. Kelso	You moved my car there, didn't you!

26531	Todd	Assisted five! I'll take it!
26532	Dr. Cox	Walk with me.
26533	I cannot believe that you of all people are the one I have to tell this to	Ego is good, you dumb-ass. It's the reason that guy wants you to be his surgeon , it's the reason that she is borderline attracted to you , and it's the reason she so desperately wants to marry you.
26534	J.D.	Page me when you're headed home!
26535	Dr. Cox	Bottom line, in medicine, half of pulling it off is believing you're the biggest, smartest bad-ass of a doctor to ever walk these halls. You wanna see how you end up if you don't believe that?
26536	Doug	I don't know how it happened again, but it did!
26537	J.D.'s Narration	As I gangsta-leaned down the hallway in the rad new wheels I found by the dumpster, I couldn't help but think how ego affects everything.
26538	J.D.'s Narration	Without a healthy dose of it, you can't trust yourself to do what you really want.
26539	Elliot	I don't think that we were going too quick at all. By the way, what do you do?
26540	Jake	I make and distribute Hungarian pornography.
26541	Elliot	Ohhh!
26542	Jake	I'm a real estate developer.
26543	Elliot	Oh, thank God!
26544	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, with too much ego you can end up losing something you wish you still had.
26545	Janitor	You okay?
26546	Dr. Kelso	I'm not used to walking from my office to the nurses' station.
26547	J.D.'s Narration	But with the right amount, nothing can get in your way.
26548	Turk	I am going to yank that gallbladder out of you so fast that your spleen is gonna say to your kidney, "WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO FRANK!?!" That's right, your kidney named your gallbladder Frank. I don't want you to worry about this another second, Mr. Hoffner, okay? 'Cause I'm the man. I am the man!
26549	Turk	Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwww, look at you! Hahaha! High five! Right there!
26550	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26551	J.D.'s Narration	So here I am. Sitting on a box, in an empty apartment with a dead dog, and a single tear on my cheek. I can't help but wonder how I got to this place.
26552	Turk	Who are these guys?
26553	J.D.	These are the last eight guys in the hospital who don't realize I suck at basketball.
26554	Turk	Ah.
26555	J.D.	Okay, so here's what's gonna happen: I finally mastered my running hook-shot, okay?
26556	Turk	Ah-huh?
26557	J.D.	So when we go to pick teams, I'm gonna hit that shot. Then you say, "I'll take that guy!" At which point, Carla is gonna page me . And I'll say, "Crap, I gotta go." And you go, "Damn! We just lost the best player out here!" Then there'll be eight guys in the hospital who think I'm good at sports, and word will spread.
26558	Turk	When do you find time to see your patients?
26559	J.D.	Between these thoughts.
26560	Turk	Oh. Okay. Let's play some ball!
26561	Turk	I got that guy.
26562	J.D.'s Narration	Elliot's boyfriend, Jake, had given her confidence to do things she'd never been able to do before.
26563	Jake	Okay, you ready to do this?
26564	Elliot	You know it!
26565	J.D.'s Narration	...Like talking to people when she's on the toilet.
26566	Jake	Uh, okay, uh, I know how comfortable you are with Carla, so I'm gonna have her do the talking, all right? You just say when.
26567	Elliot	There's cheeks on the seat, and I'm feeling good! Let's hear it.

26573	Dr. Kelso	That was me, folks.
26574	Ted	Three-twelve times four-eighty-one equals.... Sir, it's not giving me the answer!
26575	Dr. Kelso	It's a typewriter, you jackass!
26576	Ted	Oh, God, it's got my tie!
26577	Dr. Cox	Bob, this whole thing is only gonna take a couple of days, so why not let Jordan do it? Yes, she is a member of the board, but, hell, that only gets her out of the house once every couple of months or so. And I know she loves our son Jack with all her heart, but I think spending every waking moment with the child, I think...I think it's starting to get to her.
26578	Jordan	I hate you!
26579	Dr. Cox	So, whatta you say, there, Bobbo?
26580	Dr. Kelso	Welcome aboard! This will be your office for the next few days!

26586	Turk	Yeah.
26587	J.D.	Why are we lying in the parking lot?
26588	Turk	Your hook-shot knocked you unconscious, so I lied down next to you so everyone would just think we were chillin'.
26589	J.D.	Oh, thanks SCB! By the way, I should tell you something: I found an apartment, I'm moving out the day after tomorrow.
26590	Turk	Wow.
26591	J.D.	Yeah.
26592	Turk	What does "SCB" mean?
26593	J.D.	"Super Chocolate Bear."
26594	Turk	I love it.
26595	J.D.	I knew you would.

26597	Nurse	Someone stole a whole case of laxatives from the supply closet.
26598	Nurse Roberts	Don't look at me I'm as regular as rain.
26599	Janitor	Who wants a piece of pie!
26600	J.D.	Who made it?
26601	Janitor	Let's say my mom.
26602	J.D.'s Narration	As a doctor, you get good at piecing things together.
26603	Nurse	Someone stole a case of laxatives.
26604	Janitor	Who wants a piece of pie!
26605	J.D.'s Narration	This one was obvious.
26606	J.D.	No thank you.
26607	Todd	Free pie? Hell yeah!
26608	Carla	I can't believe you two have lived together for twelve years.
26609	Turk	Do you remember our first day together?
26610	Turk	Yo, they call me Chris One. What's the dilly-yo?
26611	J.D.	Welcome to our lair! I'm an eighth-level ogre magi with invisibility. And this is Randall!
26612	J.D.	You were a dork!
26613	J.D.	I'm glad nothing else around here is changing.
26614	Carla	You see, this is the time of year where everybody leaves for new jobs, but Turk's got another year of residency.
26615	Elliot	Yeah, and J.D. and I just took positions here as staff internists.
26616	Jake	Is that what you wanted to do?
26617	Elliot	There was an endocrinology fellowship with this amazing doctor over at County, but it was a little over my head.
26618	Jake	So you took a fall-back job because you were afraid to go for it?
26619	J.D.	Uhh, Jake...is it?
26620	Jake	Yeah, it's
26621	J.D.	I know your name, Jake, I'm being condescending.
26622	Todd	Out of my way! I got a doozy of a twosie!
26623	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26624	Dr. Cox	All right, then, before we jump in to rounds, I see it's time for my annual cologne intervention. Lonnie, you're killing us. And, honestly, what's the point? D'you understand that no matter how badly you wanna get freaky with Karen, here, that's just not going to happen, and here's why: She thinks you have the body of a fetus. Oh, Karen, did you tell me that in confidence?
26625	Karen	No, he knows.
26626	Lonnie	She drew me a picture.
26627	Jordan	Don't sweat it too much, kid. He wore so much cologne on our first date, I had to sell my Miata!
26628	Dr. Cox	WHY?
26629	Jordan	For funsies!
26630	Dr. Cox	Heel!
26631	Lonnie	Thanks for that.
26632	Jordan	Keep movin', fetus face.

26634	J.D.	Come here, boy! Come on, Rowdy!
26635	Turk	No, you come here and eat your steak!
26636	Carla	What are you doing?
26637	J.D.	Oh, whoever Rowdy goes to first, he gets to keep him.
26638	Carla	So, you moved back all the furniture and defrosted our dinner with your sweaty hands for a joke!?
26639	Turk	Yeah, we did....
26640	Carla	If he stays, I'll drive him out to the country and leave him there.
26641	J.D.'s Thoughts	Huzzah! He's mine!
26642	Elliot	I can't believe you talked me into this! I will never get this fellowship I don't interview well. It's the reason I didn't get into Harvard. The second the professor asked me what I hoped to accomplish in college, my nose started bleeding, and I sneezed and splattered his shirt with blood.
26643	Jake	You know, dammit, Elliot, how many people do you have to talk to while you're peeing before you start believing in yourself?
26644	Elliot	You're right.
26645	Doctor	So...why are you interested in this fellowship?
26646	Elliot	Ahem. Well, first off, I have incredible passion for the work you're doing. I've heard that you're an amazing doctor and I would be honored to have the opportunity to work with you, Mr. Gold.
26647	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26648	Jordan	Have a great day, honey!
26649	Dr. Cox	You have even a better one, you! You do it, you! Yeah, you have even a better one!
26650	Dr. Kelso	Perry, I get the feeling something is bothering you.
26651	Dr. Cox	Bob, people have a private life and people have a professional life, and usually those two hells are kept pretty separate. For instance, I don't know that much about your home life, other than the fact that you treat your wife like a dog, your dog like a wife, and your son like an androgynous ne'er-do-well who drained your retirement nest-egg to open up a yarn shop in Minneapolis.
26652	Dr. Kelso	Harrison posted his first profit this quarter.
26653	Dr. Cox	Aces.
26654	Dr. Kelso	Terrence.
26655	Dr. Cox	Terrence doesn't follow him around the shop all day telling him just exactly what color is "in" this season or showing all of the other employees that he is not in fact the boss of his own life. You see, the woman is everywhere! She's there when I work out in the morning, when I work out in the car on the way to work, and when I work out when I get to work. I can't seem to get away from her. And that used to be fine when she just came around for five minutes every month or so to feed on my dignity, but now, I'd honestly kill myself, Bob, if I wasn't convinced that Jordan wouldn't already be there waiting for me in the afterlife. You see, typical of her, she went ahead and signed us up for an eternal tandem bike-ride all along the banks of the River Styx.
26656	Dr. Kelso	I'm so glad you shared.
26657	Dr. Kelso	How would you like to make this a full-time job?
26658	Jordan	I'll have to think about it!
26659	Dr. Kelso	How could you not see this coming?
26660	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26661	J.D.	Hooch just got in the shower.
26662	Turk	Let the games begin.
26663	Hooch	Who the hell...put bouillon cubes in the shower head!?! Huh? Hm, did you do it? Hm? Did you? If it happens again, I will wait in my S.U.V., blast me some speed-metal 5.1 surround sound, heavy on the bass and someone...will be getting...mowed...down.
26664	Hooch	Deet-deet-deet!
26665	J.D.	Hooch is crazy!
26666	J.D.	I'm really gonna miss this kinda stuff.
26667	Turk	Why? We'll still be able to pull pranks on him after you move out.
26668	J.D.	Yeah, but we won't be able to stay up 'til six in the morning planning anything as genius as the soup shower! This is the end of an era, Super Choc.
26669	Turk	You know how you're prone to overly sensitive girly displays of sentimentality?
26670	J.D.	Guilty.
26671	Turk	Okay, now, if you reel it back a little bit, I'll get somebody to cover for me tonight, and I'll help you pack your stuff.
26672	J.D.	Oh! Can we cut words out of magazines that represent how we feel about each other and glue them into a "Friends Forever" collage?
26673	Turk	Hell no.
26674	J.D.	Oh. Well, can we drink beers and reminisce?
26675	Turk	Hell yes!
26676	J.D.	That's all I wanted to do anyway.
26677	J.D.'s Thoughts	Plus, I already made the collage.
26678	Turk	Now, listen to me. You gotta make tonight count. 'Cause you'll never be as cool as you were when you were rollin' with The Big Dog as your roommate, you know?
26679	J.D.'s Thoughts	No, I didn't know.
26680	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26681	Carla	Well, maybe Jake shouldn't have pushed you into that interview.
26682	Elliot	Maybe I should have covered my mouth when I sneezed blood the second time.
26683	Carla	Oh, come on, Elliot! He's always telling you what to do.
26684	Elliot	That's not true!
26685	Intercom	Hey, it's Jake, buzz me up.
26686	Elliot	Ohhh, my God, you're right.
26687	Carla	Don't let him be your puppet-master.
26688	Jake	Hey!
26689	Elliot	Hey.
26690	Jake	What's up?
26691	Elliot	I have a headache.
26692	Jake	Take some aspirin.
26693	Elliot	Don't tell me what to do! You're not the boss of me!
26694	Jake	Okay, what just happened?
26695	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26696	Jordan	So, do you think I should take the job? Perry?
26697	Dr. Cox	Oh. I'm sorry, honey. I was just thinking about this little boy in here. He's only eight years old and he's terminal. I just hope his parents spent as much time with him as they could you're here one minute, and then the next you're.... What, uh, what were you saying?
26698	Jordan	Nothing.
26699	Dr. Cox	Stick your hand out.
26700	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26701	Turk	Hey! Oh! Oh! J.D.! I got a mondo 82-inch pizza with our names on it! Dude! It's huuuu
26702	Turk	Dude? What the hell, we're supposed to hang and all of a sudden you moved out?
26703	J.D.'s Narration	It's hard to hide your emotions in front of people who know you well.
26704	Jake	Answer it.
26705	Jake	Or don't.
26706	Elliot	Hello?
26707	J.D.'s Narration	...Like excitement about a new job...
26708	Elliot	I got the fellowship!
26709	Jake	Hey!
26710	J.D.'s Narration	...Or disappointment about a lost opportunity...
26711	Jordan	I'm sorry, Bob, I can't take the job.
26712	Dr. Kelso	Maybe next year.
26713	J.D.'s Narration	As for me, I just didn't want Turk to know that he'd hurt my feelings.
26714	J.D.	I dunno, I figured it wasn't that big a deal. Anyway, I'm pretty tired from the move, so I'm probably just gonna crash.
26715	J.D.	...Sort of famished...
26716	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26717	Ted	Morning.
26718	Turk	Mm.
26719	J.D.'s Narration	Turk didn't even realize he'd pissed me off, so explaining my feelings to him was the smart move. I took a slightly different tack.
26720	J.D.	That seat's taken, ass-face!
26721	Turk	By who?
26722	J.D.	Hello there, Chocolate Bear Two.
26723	Turk	Hooch!? J.D., what the hell is going on here!?
26724	J.D.	I replaced your ass!
26725	Hooch	By the by, Johnny told me that you were responsible for my...brothy shower the other day.
26726	Turk	Well, you know....
26727	Hooch	If it happens again, I'm gonna take one of your fingers. That'll be my...funny prank.
26728	J.D.	Hooch is crazy.
26729	J.D.	Oh, sorry, old habit.
26730	J.D.'s Narration	I wasn't the only unhappy person in our hospital family.
26731	Carla	Sure, Jake, I'll tell you why it feels like I have a problem with you. The fact that Elliot jumps so high whenever you tell her to may seem harmless, but as a result she's been stealing all my sports bras! Seriously, the only one I have left is the one I'm wearing; and it works great, see? Huh?
26732	Jake	It works pretty nicely.
26733	Carla	It does, right?
26734	Jake	Okay, I'm obviously gonna have to guess what your point is here, but I think it's that I control Elliot? Which I don't. Here, watch this: Elliot, will you shove that guy?
26735	Jake	Why would you do that? I was tr I was trying to prove you don't do everything I say.
26736	Elliot	Well, clue me in, stud! That was Creepy Carl he runs an up-skirt website. ...I'm on it...
26737	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26738	Jordan	Oh, yeah, Ted, I moved the file cabinet.
26739	Dr. Cox	Why? It smells like that odd combo of flopsweat, hopelessness, and feet.
26740	Jordan	Yeah, I know, it's just...I guess this stupid job made me feel valid again, you know? You don't know. It's okay. See you at home.
26741	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26742	Janitor	Who's ready for a pie break?
26743	J.D.	No!
26744	Janitor	Come on, why not?
26745	J.D.	Why don't you ask Todd? Due to what can only be described as epic diarrhea, he's been on an I.V. drip for thirty-six hours!
26746	Todd	Make-it-stop five?
26747	J.D.'s Thoughts	Maybe I was being unfair to Turk. Maybe it's too much to expect a friend to just sense that you're upset and wanna talk about it.
26748	Elliot	Carla, I can sense you're upset. Talk to me.
26749	J.D.'s Thoughts	Okay, but Turk's a prideful guy, and it's hard for prideful guys to admit when they've been insensitive.
26750	Dr. Cox	Listen, Jordan, I've been incredibly insensitive.
26751	J.D.'s Thoughts	Touché, magic hallway.
26752	J.D.	Turk!
26753	Hooch	No, it's me Hooch, Vanilla Bear! Heh heh!
26754	J.D.	Hooch is crazy....
26755	J.D.	So, Hooch, this is it.
26756	J.D.'s Narration	Then things took a turn.
26757	J.D.	Wait, where's Rowdy?
26758	J.D.	There he is!
26759	J.D.	THERE HE IS!
26760	Hooch	I'll try.
26761	Turk	So where's Chocolate Bear Number Two?
26762	Hooch	Who else thinks they're faster than me, huh? Huh!?
26763	J.D.	Yo, Hooch is seriously crazy.
26764	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26765	Elliot	Well, look, Carla, Jake makes me happy! Plus, there's a decent chance he'll be my second serious boyfriend not to end up in bed with my mom or my brother Barry. And he doesn't always tell me what to do. I mean, sure, he did tell me to come up here and talk to you, but I was gonna do that anyway 'cause I wanted to ask if you thought I should wear hooker heels or flats with my pink skirt when we go celebrate my new job tonight but instead I'm trying to figure out what your problem is.
26766	Carla	Look! I thought you were staying, okay?
26767	I've been here for eleven years, and it's always the same story	I get really close to someone, they move on. I don't wanna be fifty, making friends with the new 25-year-old interns, Elliot. They'll make fun of me when we go dancing!
26768	Elliot	Not if I go with you!
26769	Todd	And then they kiss?
26770	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26771	Jordan	Look at him. What an angel.
26772	Jordan	Down! He's waking up!
26773	Dr. Cox	Hey, Jordan, um.... Lookit, I tried to guilt you into not taking that job.
26774	Jordan	Really?
26775	Jordan	Look, I don't wanna be one of those moms that never sees her kids. But I also don't wanna be one of those moms that stays at home but then resents her kids 'cause she wishes she was working so she could go to an office and feel bad about not being at home with her kids.
26776	Dr. Cox	Sweetie, you are an evil, soulless, chemically-enhanced battle-axe that I truly doubt is a hundred percent human, but...you are an amazing mom.
26777	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26778	J.D.	Just say you're sorry, give me a hug, and this'll all be over.
26779	Turk	Why do I have to say I'm sorry?
26780	J.D.	Dude, I don't mean to sound girly, but, for the last twelve years, you've practically been like...my wife.
26781	Turk	How is that girly?
26782	J.D.	Look, before, when you said I'd never be as cool as when I was living with you, you know there's some truth to that. I'm sorta like odd and geeky, and you've always sort of...validated me.
26783	Turk	J.D., you're just moving out.
26784	J.D.	Well, say things'll be the same.
26785	Turk	That's Carla and I gotta go.
26786	J.D.	Mmkay.
26787	Turk	All right.
26788	Janitor	No better pick-me-up than a slice of Mom's pie!
26789	J.D.	Why are you so obsessed with this!?
26790	Janitor	I dunno. I think it's 'cause this time, I wasn't trying to mess with you.
26791	J.D.	Really?
26792	Janitor	Really.
26793	Janitor	Huh?
26794	J.D.	Who would do this to themselves?
26795	Janitor	Totally worth it.
26796	J.D.'s Narration	As every piece of food I'd put into my body in the last year was rushing out of me, it got me thinking. The way some things never change shines a light on the things that do.
26797	J.D.'s Narration	Like when a new person comes into the hospital to stay...
26798	Jordan	My office keys, Ted?
26799	Elliot	I can't believe I'm actually doing this. You're meeting me out later, right?
26800	J.D.'s Narration	...Or an old friend leaves for good.
26801	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes the biggest changes are a result of an impulsive decision.
26802	Carla	I think we should have a baby.
26803	Turk	Whoa!
26804	Carla	Hm?
26805	Turk	Whoa!!
26806	Carla	What?
26807	Turk	I know you're feeling abandoned right now, but we just went through a really rough spot, and I'm not the type of guy to make life-changing decisions without thinking about it for at least, like...a few months.
26808	Turk	Let's make a baby.
26809	J.D.'s Narration	And so here I am a guy in an empty apartment with a dead dog. Oh, and that's not a tear on my cheek, that's just from the leak in my ceiling. And, yes, change is scary, but it's also inevitable. It's up to you to make the best of it. I mean, it's not like opportunity is just gonna fall in to your lap.
26810	Woman	Agh!
26811	J.D.'s Narration	Then again....
26812	J.D.	Howdy, neighbor, I'm Jonathan!
26813	Woman	Hi.
26814	Guy	You eyeballin' my woman?
26815	J.D.'s Narration	I hate change.

26817	Open	Hotel parking lot. A valet drives a Porsche convertible to the front door.
26818	J.D.'s Narration	Since my apartment's roof collapsed, I was living in a hotel. But that's not the only thing that's changed around here.
26819	J.D.'s Narration	Now that I'm an attending, I'm a licensed bad-ass. Elliot actually works at a different hospital. She's trying to lay low the first couple of weeks.
26820	Elliot	Woooooo!
26821	J.D.'s Narration	And Turk and Carla are trying to make a baby.
26822	Carla	Here you go, baby. I know you love foreplay, but I only have five minutes, so I made you a sandwich.
26823	Turk	That's the sexiest thing I've ever seen.
26824	Carla	Over here, Turk.
26825	Turk	My bad, baby.
26826	J.D.'s Narration	Yep, life was pretty different.
26827	Porsche Owner	Hey! You took my Porsche from the valet?
26828	J.D.'s Thoughts	This didn't feel like my scooter.
26829	J.D.	Ow! Look, no harm done. Here's your driving glasses, here's your driving scarf, and here are you driving gloves.
26830	J.D.	Fine, here's your driving sock.
26831	J.D.'s Narration	I didn't care, because now that I'm and attending, I had picked out a whole new look.
26832	J.D.	Morning, colleague!
26833	Dr. Cox	Oh, absolutely not.
26834	J.D.	Ooh, what, tall, dark and scary? I can wear whatever the hell I What are you doing?
26835	Dr Cox	This is my new, imaginary warning light. Whenever it starts blinking, a situation has ten seconds to resolve itself before I flash white with rage and kill someone. One, two, three, four...
26836	Dr. Cox	...seven, eight, nine and ten.
26837	J.D.	I had a little trouble getting my Baby Gap t-shirt off.
26838	Dr. Cox	It'll happen.
26839	J.D.	Ow.
26840	J.D.	Whoooaaaaahhhh! OK, you know, I'm gonna I'm gonna go with 'ow.'
26841	Janitor	How depressing is it being you? I mean seriously, would you equate it more with being a lifelong Cub fan or to, say, being born without lips?
26842	J.D.	Born without lips.
26843	Janitor	I know a guy. His house just burned down.
26844	J.D.	How sad.
26845	Janitor	Well, he was smoking in bed. He shouldn't have smoked. Because he looked ridiculous.
26846	Janitor	I have a snake face.
26847	J.D.	Listen, today, if you bother me, could you do it without being around me? Because I have new interns starting today. Can you imagine what it's like to see this place through their eyes for the first time?
26848	Todd	There's something on your shirt, kid.
26849	Camera	Huh?
26850	Todd	Ah ha ha! Classic.
26851	Jordan	Sparky! It's five dollars a minute to stare in public. It's free in private. Rrrrrr.
26852	Dr. Kelso	You're gonna love it here, sport!
26853	Ted	Get out while you still can!
26854	Camera	Uh...
26855	Ted	Seriously, get out while you still can.
26856	Laverne	Junior, have you seen Johnny? You know, the Alzheimer's patient who likes to tackle people?
26857	Camera	Mmmm, mm-mm.
26858	Laverne	Has anyone seen Johnny, the tackling Alzheimer's patient?
26859	J.D.	Hey! You must be Keith. Don't look so nervous, buddy, I got your back.
26860	Johnny	WHO AM I?!
26861	Laverne	I found him.

26864	J.D.	Someone's close enough for a hair-mussing! Digga-digga-digga-ha!
26865	J.D.	Dynamite bangs. Hey guys, follow me. Listen, if you're having trouble finding a vein for an IV, please don't page me. If you're desperate, you're lucky. This is a city hospital, there are plenty of heroin addicts around who are quite adept at this. Did you find a vein there, Reverend Mayhem?
26866	Heroin Addict	No problem.
26867	J.D.	OK, good work, buddy. Stay in school.
26868	J.D.	Mr. Kellerman, how're you feeling?
26869	Mr. Kellerman	Oh, not great.
26870	J.D.	Well, that's probably why you're here! Ha! Humor is a great ice-breaker for patients, OK? Follow me. Mr. Kellerman has congestive heart failure. OK, Lisa, I want you to start him on diuretics, OK? That way we'll loosen up some of the fluid around his lungs. The good news is, he'll go home tomorrow. Bad news is if he's not here he won't move up on the heart transplant list. See, in medicine there are lots of Catch 22's, a phrase made famous, I believe, by an old fisherman, who would stay out fishing until he caught how many fish? Anybody? That's right, 22. See, in 1492, Columbus
26871	Dr. Cox	Newbie! If you loved the sound of your very own voice any more, you'd probably just sit in a little room all day and sing to yourself.
26872	J.D.	Oh, you guys can skedaddle.
26873	Dr. Kelso	Booga-booga!
26874	Keith	Ahh!
26875	Dr. Kelso	I love interns! Gentlemen, a reminder, as attendings you are expected to turn in your insurance paperwork and your required urine sample by tomorrow.
26876	Dr. Cox	Bob, I'm not planning on doing any paperwork. But I did go ahead and leave my urine sample on your driver's side car door.
26877	Dr. Kelso	Perry, your lips, my ass, they should meet. Dorian, after four years, I can only hope that you are no longer following in his footsteps.
26878	J.D.	I turned in my paperwork already, but I'm gonna wait till tomorrow to turn in my urine sample out of respect for the fellows in the lab. There's an asparagus issue.
26879	Dr. Kelso	Now there's an answer that warrants a half-sincere pat on the shoulder.
26880	J.D.	Thanks, Dr. Kelso! You know he said half-sincere, but I think he was full-sincere. Feel my shoulder, it's still warm.
26881	Dr. Cox	Lindsay, by you reaching the level of attending physician, you've somehow managed to become a member of club that *I* belong to. Obviously, there was no vote, because if there had been, you would still hear the sound of my voice screaming, "Nay! Nay! Oh, dear God, one thousand times nay!" That being said, it's my obligation to let you in on the organization's one and only bylaw: We're men.
26882	J.D.	Yes we are.
26883	Dr. Cox	The women are men, the children are men, the men of course...*men.* So, I went ahead and took the liberty of making you five man cards.
26884	Dr. Cox	Hold them very dear because every time you drop the ball "manwise," I'm going to take one from you.
26885	J.D.	I don't need your approval, or your stupid man cards! Although the lettering is darling, have you ever done calligraphy?
26886	Dr. Cox	Thank you.
26887	J.D.	Damn it!
26888	J.D.'s Narration	That night, since we were low on cash, Turk snuck me into the movies.
26889	Turk	One, please.
26890	J.D.'s Narration	Afterwards, we talked about my living arrangements.
26891	J.D.	Are you sure about this?
26892	Turk	You shouldn't stay in a hotel, so why don't you just stay here until you find a place?
26893	J.D.	Carla was pretty psyched to get rid of me. Are you gonna tell her?
26894	Turk	I don't know, what do you think?
26895	Carla	Turk? Is that you?
26896	Turk	Yes, I'll be right in, baby.
26897	Carla	Mm, OK.
26898	J.D.	Turk, you left your gym shorts in here!
26899	Turk	Look. I gotta sex her up. I'll be back as quick as I can. So I'll be 'bout an hour and half.
26900	J.D.	W-w-w-wait! Could you quickly scratch my nose? Ah. Ooh. Okay. Okay.
26901	J.D.	Don't zip me up. NO! Turk! Turk! Whoa, Whooooaaa!
26902	Elliot	I'm a little sick of the Turks!
26903	Omar	Excuse me?
26904	Elliot	No, not you, Omar, I love your people. I'm talking about their lovey-dovey crap.
26905	Carla	Oh, babe, I borrowed your backpack this morning and all my change fell out the bottom.
26906	J.D.	Maybe someone or something had to gnaw a hole in it to keep from suffocating.
26907	Turk	And maybe someone already apologized for that about a hundred times.
26908	J.D.	Well maybe a hundred wasn't enough, I don't know!
26909	Dr. Cox	Absolutely no lover's quarrels!
26910	J.D.	Damn it!
26911	Turk	Elliot, by the way, what are you doing here?
26912	Carla	Oh, she hasn't talked to anybody at her new hospital yet.
26913	Elliot	How did this conversation become about me?
26914	J.D.	The Turks are sneaky.
26915	J.D.	Not you guys, I think Omar took my pudding.
26916	Omar	Mmmmm.
26917	J.D.	Hey Keith! Can I get your pudding?
26918	Keith	Uh...Eh..
26919	J.D.	Interns.
26920	Elliot	Oooh..
26921	Carla	Elliot, you should be excited about meeting people over there. You could totally reinvent yourself.
26922	Elliot	You're right! I am gonna tell them that I am the most perfect doctor ever, who never needs anyone's help with anything! Ha!
26923	Turk	That'll end well. Dude!
26924	J.D.	That's my pudding, Omar!
26925	J.D.	Huh. This guy's unbelievable.
26926	J.D.	OK, guys, for some reason Mr. Kellerman's fluid situation isn't getting any better. I think we should be more aggressive. Keith? Why don't you go get a Lasix drip.
26927	J.D.	Other way, Keith!
26928	J.D.	Uh, Jason, when you're filling out a female patient's exam report, her breasts can be healthy or unhealthy. Never "bangin' double-D's."
26929	Jason	There's so much paperwork. My dad was a veterinarian and he never had to do any. Sometimes I wish this place were more like a horse hospital.
26930	J.D.	I'm sorry, Mr. Larson, but I do not like the look of that leg.
26931	J.D.	We would have better hours. All right, gang, get out of here. Hey, everybody? Great work today.
26932	Janitor	How do you bother someone without being around them? That is the question.
26933	Dr. Kelso	Dorian, I'm paying you to work, not stand around acting like The Fonz.
26934	Janitor	Perfect.
26935	J.D.'s Narration	Being Turk's secret roommate was going great. Until now.
26936	Carla	Turk? I'm leaving for work.
26937	J.D.'s Thoughts	OK, you've been working on your Turk impression since college. Time to shine!
26938	Carla	Turk?
26939	J.D.	Baby I'll be thinking about your lovelies and whatnot until the second I see you. But right now, I'm doin' my business.
26940	Carla	Don't forget to use the Glade!
26941	Turk	Dude! That's the best that's ever sounded!
26942	J.D.	I thought she was gone.
26943	Turk	Nah, she came back for a quickie. All this baby stuff, man, I feel like she rushed me into it. To tell you the truth I'm not even sure I'm ready.
26944	J.D.	Well, you better get ready. She's been off the pill for like a week.
26945	J.D.	What have you done?
26946	Turk	Think she'll be mad?
26947	Doctor #1	Doctor Reid? You need some help?
26948	Elliot	Heh. I don't need anyone's help, thank you.
26949	Elliot	Stop running!
26950	Doctor #2	Doctor? Do you know where the Foley caths are?
26951	Elliot	Sir, I know where everything is, ha ha. I'll be right back.
26952	Elliot	Stupid coffee robot! Frick!
26953	Elliot	Don't sweat it, kid. I used to hide here when I worked at this place. I'm in a fellowship now. Um, Foley cath, please. Thanks.
26954	Doctor #2	Thanks. Could you also grab a number six needle?
26955	Elliot	Oh. Frick, fricky, frick, frick!
26956	Janitor	Nice ass, grandma!
26957	J.D.'s Thoughts	That screaming patient would have to wait. I had bigger problems.
26958	J.D.	Hey, Keith! I just called upstairs to see how Mr. Kellerman was doing. And get this, the nurse told me you never even started him on a Lasix drip. And Lisa! Imagine my surprise when she told me you never even increased his diuretic in the first place! I'm forced to ask, are you people trained killers? Say something, Keith.
26959	Keith	Uh...I...Eh...Uh...
26960	Jason	Dr. Dorian? If he gets bad enough that we have to put him on inotropes, he'll jump to the top of the transplant list and then he'll get a new heart.
26961	J.D.'s Thoughts	They're messing up on purpose?
26962	J.D.	Who told you guys to do this?
26963	J.D.'s Narration	There's a lot of ways to get caught.
26964	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes you get caught because you couldn't slip your wife her pill last night, so you had to feed her one of your special, homemade brownies.
26965	Carla	What's that?
26966	Turk	Oh, that that's a tiny marshmallow with writing on it.
26967	J.D.'s Narration	Still, if you don't panic, you can get away with it.
26968	Elliot	Just...doing some inventory...sir.
26969	Dr. Kelso	That's why I'm glad you work here, sweetheart.
26970	J.D.	Come on, guys. Who put you up to this?
26971	J.D.'s Narration	As for me, I caught my culprit because he made the classic mistake of returning to the scene of the crime. And all because I, too, had been eating Turk's special, homemade brownies.
26972	Dr. Cox	Angie, my buddy down in the lab just told me that your urinalysis came back positive for...the birth control pill. So. I will be taking one of these. Thank you!
26973	J.D.'s Thoughts	Damn it.
26974	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
26975	Open	Cafeteria, Keith's POV. Keith is staring at his shoes, stuttering nervously.)
26976	J.D.	Keith, look at me.
26977	J.D.	Did he specifically tell you to disregard my orders?
26978	Dr. Cox	Oh, what the hell. I was doing this and mouthing "I'll kill you" which I will, if you don't get out of here. Go on, get.
26979	Ted	Hey, I saw it first. Long day.
26980	Dr. Cox	Newbie, I did tell them to ignore you and let Mr. Kellerman get worse, and you want to know something? I'd do it again.
26981	Carla	Bye, Elliot.
26982	Turk	Look, I know I agreed to have a baby, but you were offering sex at the time. I would have agreed to anything!
26983	Carla	Ohh!
26984	Elliot	Carla, no.
26985	Turk	NO! She knows I can't eat without my strawberry milk. You should have just let her fork me!
26986	Elliot	I think that's how you got into trouble the first place. Wassup!
26987	Todd	Euphemism five!
26988	Elliot	His vocabulary has gotten so much better!
26989	Turk	Elliot, why are you here?
26990	Elliot	Oh. I have to make Kelso think I still work here so he doesn't have me arrested for stealing medical supplies. By the by, what would you have done if you couldn't give Carla the pill?
26991	Turk	I could have faked it.
26992	Elliot	Guys can't fake it.
26993	Turk	Really? Does this sound familiar? Oh! Oh, baby! We're goin' all night, no wait don't move! Sorry.
26994	Elliot	Way too familiar.
26995	J.D.	Hey!
26996	Dr. Cox	Thank you.
26997	J.D.	You know what I've been doing? I mean, besides listening to my Alanis Morissette CD to get me pumped up to talk to you? Here.
26998	Dr. Cox	Yup.
26999	J.D.	I've been thinking about how completely ridiculous it is that you would take Mr. Kellerman's life into your hands without talking to him.
27000	Dr. Cox	I did talk to him.
27001	Mr. Kellerman	He did.
27002	Dr. Cox	Patients who stay low on the heart transplant list die waiting for one. This way he moves up to the top of the list. Come on!
27003	J.D.	Then why didn't you tell me?
27004	Dr. Cox	Because you're an attending now. And that doesn't just mean a fat bank account, expensive new toys and a fancy lawyer on retainer for when you kill a prostitute. From now on, the buck stops with you, and I know that you have occasionally bent the rules in this dump over the last couple of years, but you only did it because you knew when the crap started raining down it was damn sure gonna fall on my head. But now, the only way for you to stay out of the trouble storm is for you to go by the book and I've got news for you on that front. By-the-book attendings kill us up here. Newbie, I couldn't tell you about Kellerman because I don't know what type of attending you're going to be.
27005	J.D.	Allow me to thank you for giving me the opportunity to prove myself. You know what? This is my last one, here.
27006	J.D.	Take it! Whatever happens to this poor guy is on you.
27007	J.D.	s Narration: The next morning was not good. Carla was not talking to Turk. Elliot had dropped by to help not talk to Turk, and I was sneaking out in my undies because my clothes were downstairs in the dryer.
27008	Elliot	J.D.?
27009	J.D.	Morning, friends! Who's ready for some java?
27010	Carla	Are you wearing boxers?
27011	J.D.	Yes, I am, Carla, because I know when Turk's sad, he likes me to come over in my boxers because he likes to call me his honky Adonis, and that's what friends do.
27012	J.D.'s Thoughts	They bought it? Are we that gay?
27013	Turk	What's that?
27014	J.D.	Oh, it's my new driving sock.
27015	J.D.	You can borrow.
27016	Turk	Actually, J.D.'s been living here secretly.
27017	J.D.	Turk, why?
27018	Turk	Because I gotta get those damn judgmental eyes off me!
27019	J.D.	J.D. didn't want to live here, I begged him.
27020	Carla	Is that true?
27021	Turk	I didn't say that, J.D. can do my voice.
27022	Elliot	Hey, it's getting good!
27023	J.D.	Oh, thank you! Oh, I lost it.
27024	Carla	Oh, you three are ridiculous.
27025	Elliot	Hey! Pfft. I'm just here to grab a ride to work.
27026	Carla	At a hospital where you don't actually work! And you...?
27027	Turk	How am I supposed to tell you I might not be ready to have a baby when you're so excited?
27028	Carla	And you, secretly moving back in here? Now I really don't love being den mother to you three...
27029	Carla	...fine, it's like crack to me. Still, let me ask you something. Why are you three so afraid of moving on?!
27030	Turk	Dude, you're still eating those brownies.
27031	J.D.	I don't wanna get pregnant! Shoot.
27032	Dr. Kelso	So, you're going to the university for a transplant! Well, come back and see us, okay?
27033	Dr. Kelso	Who the hell is responsible for not treating that man?
27034	Dr. Cox	Well, Bobbo, I was going to treat him, but I lost my stethoscope...
27035	J.D.	He's my patient, Bob. I'm responsible.
27036	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Dorian, I've kept my mouth shut about all the recent sexual harassment complaints because I don't think it's fair to punish a man for making small talk, or say, asking his secretary just once to dress up as a geisha girl and call him Kelso-san.
27037	J.D.	What?
27038	Dr. Kelso	Nothing. But now I need to know: is this the type of attending you're going to be?
27039	J.D.	I guess so.
27040	Dr. Kelso	Anything else?
27041	J.D.'s Thoughts	I could tell him there's nothing in my cup and I'm just pretending to drink to seem non-chalant...
27042	J.D.	No.
27043	J.D.'s Thoughts	But instead, I was thinking about what Carla said about moving on. And I wasn't the only one.
27044	Dr. Kelso	Well, at least there's one attending around here I can count on.
27045	Elliot	Ah, the hell with it, Bob. I don't work here. Have a good one!
27046	Dr. Kelso	I hate this place.
27047	Dr. Cox	It hates you, Bob.
27048	Carla	That's it. All of my birth control pills are gone.
27049	Turk	Not exactly. That Fig Newton you're about to eat is not only fat free, but it's baby free.
27050	Carla	Blech.
27051	Carla	I just don't get it, Turk.
27052	Turk	Look, we've had sex twenty times in eight days and I bet it's because you sense my hesitance.
27053	Carla	I just want a baby so badly.
27054	Turk	Why? What's it gonna be like having a baby?
27055	Carla	Dr. Cox says it's like having a dog that slowly learns how to talk.
27056	Turk	Awesome.
27057	Carla	Right? And I come from a big family and I love that.
27058	Turk	Me, too.
27059	Carla	And every time we sit at the kitchen table I feel like someone's missing.
27060	Turk	I can see him.
27061	Carla	J.D.!
27062	J.D.	Gotta make a quick two-sie.
27063	J.D.	This explains a lot.
27064	Janitor	Hey! Meet your volleyball team. They're terrible.
27065	Dr. Cox	Newbie, I heard your voice.
27066	J.D.	Thanks for nothing, assface.
27067	Dr. Cox	I'm gonna go ahead and give you back one of these man cards. You deserve it.
27068	J.D.	Wow. Want a hug?
27069	Dr. Cox	You held onto it as long as you could, didn't you?
27070	J.D.	I'm gonna have a good year, aren't I?
27071	Dr. Cox	Anything can happen.
27072	J.D.'s Narration	And I knew he was right.
27073	Janitor	Excuse me.
27074	J.D.	AARGH!
27075	J.D.'s Narration	For all of us.
27076	Doctor #1	Dr. Reid, are you joining us for lunch today?
27077	Elliot	Ah. Anyone want half a turkey cheese sandwich?
27078	Turk	Repeat after me: Boy, boy, boy. Very tall boy!
27079	Carla	Boy, boy, boy, very tall boy.
27080	Turk	Boy, boy...
27081	Carla	Tall boy...
27082	Turk	Very tall...
27083	Carla	Very...
27084	J.D.	Goodnight, Keith. Hey, keep your head up. You're doing a good job.
27085	Keith	Thanks for everything, Dr. Dorian.
27086	Johnny	Who am I?!
27087	J.D.	Waaaaaagh!
27088	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
27089	Open	OR. Turk is scrubbing up. J.D. enters.
27090	J.D.	Hey, Turk, I'm gonna go across the street and get some coffee, you want one?
27091	Turk	Get me a small one-pump mocha.
27092	J.D.'s Thoughts	The perfect setup to a joke, but no one's around to hear!
27093	Turk	Wahh! Dude! Oh God! Waahuh! NOOOO! Dude!
27094	J.D.	So what did you want me to get you?
27095	Turk	A small one-pump mocha?
27096	J.D.	Wasn't that your nickname in high school? Hello! Huh, huh, huh, huh.
27097	Turk	Dude, there's a guy upstairs waiting to have his spleen removed.
27098	J.D.	It was worth it!
27099	Jordan	Let's go, Per!
27100	Dr. Cox	I've been waiting for an hour.
27101	Jordan	I know! I was leafing through a magazine and watching you on the security cameras. My favorite part was when you said, "Screw her!" and you stormed out and then you came back because you realized I have the keys!
27102	Dr. Cox	Jordan, now that you work here everyday, if the carpool torturing persists, I am going to put a Plexiglass separator right down the middle of the car so you can't drive me crazy; you can't, you can't, you can't! Unfortunately, your door handle doesn't work from the inside, which simply means that if we're in a fiery crash, you won't be able to get out. However, that's a risk I'm sure willing to take...
27103	Dr. Cox	Jordaroo?
27104	Dr. Cox	Hello?
27105	Jordan	I'm in here! You can't see me!
27106	Dr. Cox	JORDAN!! Oh...
27107	J.D.'s Narration	Not everyone was in hell at their jobs. In fact, there was only one thing Elliot didn't like about her new hospital: Charlie, her co-fellow.
27108	Elliot	Good morning, Charlie.
27109	Charlie	Uh, you wanna work on the osteogenesis imperfecta therapy with me?
27110	Elliot	Charlie, I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told you yesterday when you popped out of that HAZMAT bin. I work alone and you have somebody else's blood on your neck. Take a shower, man.
27111	Charlie	Fine. I'll just go.
27112	Charlie	Yes! That is an intern in a bald cap.
27113	Elliot	I hate you, Charlie.
27114	J.D.	Hippocratic Oath on three! One! Two! Three!
27115	All	First, do no harm!
27116	J.D.	There it is! All right, kick some ass today, guys.
27117	J.D.	Except for Mr. Woodson in 302, he's got that rectal tear.
27118	Dr. Kelso	You seem to be developing quite the rapport with your interns.
27119	J.D.	We even spent this weekend building a house for the homeless.
27120	Dr. Kelso	How'd that go?
27121	J.D.	Nice!
27122	J.D.	In my defense, who wears a tie to a construction site?
27123	Dr. Cox	I believe in team-building, too, Newbie and I'd make my interns agree with me, but they're in a timeout right now because one of them used the phrase "Let's rock and roll."
27124	Dr. Kelso	Son, when you're an intern you get treated like crap and when you're in a position of power, you do the same thing to them. It's inevitable. Like the tide. Or the awkward toast I'm going to have to give someday at my son's big, gay wedding. Mark my words, eventually you'll treat them like dirt like the rest of us do.
27125	J.D.	Sir, I'd love to chat, but it's already eight. I gotta rock and roll.
27126	Dr. Cox	I beg your pardon.
27127	J.D.	I'm an attending!
27128	Dr. Cox	Tell it to the wall, Newbie!
27129	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
27130	Open	Hallway. Janitor is fixing a fluorescent light on a ladder. Another man in a maintenance uniform stands nearby. J.D. enters.)
27131	J.D.	Huh, huh, huh, huh. The answer's two!
27132	Janitor	What?
27133	J.D.	How many janitors does it take to change a light bulb? Two.
27134	Janitor	OK, that didn't make any sense. Hank's an electrician. And you are not funny.
27135	J.D.	I'm very funny. Earlier, I made a killer one-pump mocha joke and everybody laughed.
27136	Janitor	I bet that nobody laughed, but you didn't notice that because you were too busy doing that cocky self-laugh thing you do when you think you're being funny.
27137	J.D	Wasn't that your nickname in high school? Huh, huh, huh, huh.
27138	J.D.	Huh, huh, huh. Any-who, have a good one, Lurch.
27139	J.D.'s Narration	I had to skedaddle, because today was burger day in the cafe and that meant one thing: 75 hungry employees and one bottle of ketchup.
27140	J.D.	Got the ketchup.
27141	Turk	And here is your burger.
27142	Elliot	Aw, frick, I forgot my burger.
27143	Turk	No, she didn't!
27144	J.D.	Hey how come Elliot never invites us over to her hospital?
27145	Carla	She probably doesn't want you guys embarrassing her.
27146	Turk	How would we embarrass her?
27147	Carla	Oh, maybe by diagnosing all your female patients with "Turk fever."
27148	Turk	Honey, a lot of women suffer from that.
27149	J.D.	It's true. I even had it.
27150	Carla	Or that stupid Siamese twin thing you do?
27151	Turk	You mean multi-ethnic Siamese doctor? Bite, please!
27152	J.D.	Here it is.
27153	Turk	Mmmm.
27154	J.D.	Mmmm. That's headed right to our joint colon.
27155	Carla	Yeah, I think I've made my point.
27156	J.D.	So tell me something, Carla, has she invited you to her new hospital?
27157	Turk and J.D.	Hmmmm?
27158	J.D.	Victory sip!
27159	Turk	Ahhh.
27160	Dr. Cox	Daphne, ketchup!
27161	Jordan	Is this seat taken?
27162	Dr. Kelso	Ketchup is for winners, Ted.
27163	Dr. Cox	Jordan, you have to make other friends in this place. For the love of God, the only respite I get from you is when we're making love and I pretend you're someone else.
27164	Jordan	Yeah, I usually pretend we're doing something else.
27165	Dr. Kelso	Damn it!
27166	Jordan	I am your new friend, so suck it.
27167	J.D.	I gotta go talk to my boys.
27168	Carla	Oh, and I have to go talk to Elliot.
27169	Turk	No wait, don't leave me!
27170	Jordan	So, I hear you and the wife are trying for a boy. Little tip: the night that Perry and I conceived Jack, he was on top, it was about three days before my ovulation, yeah. Oh, and he was choking me! GHKHKH! Oh, it was good.
27171	Turk	Oookay. I'm just...
27172	J.D.	My boys need some ketchup!
27173	J.D.	That's a lot of boys. Rex gets first dibs because I opened his chest with a buzz saw.
27174	Elliot	J.D., ketchup!
27175	Elliot	I gotta get back to my hospital.
27176	Carla	I was thinking I'd come by there and visit you tomorrow.
27177	Elliot	Tomorrow's not great, but we'll definitely do it sometime. You know, um, in the future, heh.
27178	Carla	So, we were out having Mexican food and drinking margaritas
27179	Elliot	Carla? What are you doing here?.
27180	Carla	Hey, Elliot! Let me just finish telling them the story. We were at this tiny little ATM machine...
27181	Elliot	Ugh. I knew I shouldn't have had that chimichanga. I have to, you know...
27182	Carla	Hmm?
27183	Elliot	Fff-fff.
27184	Carla	Oh. Well go for it. There's mostly guys here, they'll never think it was you.
27185	Guy In Line	I think that blonde girl just farted.
27186	Carla	Remember that, Elliot?
27187	Elliot	Yeah. I remember. Ha ha.
27188	Ted	Those two new nurses have wonderful breasts.
27189	Todd	Hey! They have names!
27190	Todd	Tina, Marge, Sloppy and Mr. Snuggles.
27191	Laverne	Sloppy's bigger than Mr. Snuggles.
27192	Jordan	What are you guys talking about?
27193	Turk	Oh, we were just...
27194	Turk	Guess they all had someplace to be!
27195	Jordan	Just go!
27196	Turk	Okay!
27197	Patient	Hey! If you feel like talking, I've got a dandy conversation starter. I have had someone else's fingers in four, count 'em, four different orifices...today.
27198	Jordan	Oh! Must be your birthday.
27199	J.D.	OK, gang I'll meet you up in radiology to talk about Mr. Heath's CAT scan. His tumor's getting so big it's starting to look like a three-mor.
27200	Janitor	Not funny.
27201	J.D.	Have you been following me around all day dressed like an intern?
27202	Janitor	Yes, and you're a terrible teacher. I'm not prepared to operate on anyone.
27203	J.D.	Whatever. If it wasn't funny, why did they all laugh?
27204	Janitor	Wake up and smell the third-floor urinal I haven't cleaned in four years. Everybody kisses the ass of the person above them.
27205	Dr. Kelso	I was going to be a cardiologist, but I didn't have the heart.
27206	Doctor	I was going to be a psychiatrist, but I was a-Freud!
27207	Doctor	Oh, yeah.
27208	Laverne	I was going to be a doctor, but I didn't have the patients.
27209	Cafeteria worker	I was gonna be a baker, but I couldn't raise the dough.
27210	Homeless Guy	Good one.
27211	Homeless Guy	You know, I was gonna have her bring you some chicken, but it was fowl.
27212	Janitor	You get it now? Your relationship with your interns is a sham.
27213	J.D.	That dog just laughed at a pun.
27214	Patient	Ooh, not gonna lie, that hurts. Not gonna lie, that hurts. Tell me about your kid.
27215	Jordan	Oh, how did you know I was a mom?
27216	Patient	As a parent myself, I can read the signs, you know? And let us not forget the understated coffee mug we're carrying.
27217	Jordan	Ah.
27218	Turk	How do I know that guy?
27219	Dr. Cox	Maybe you used to date him.
27220	Turk	Oh, that's so clever. I'm gay! Wow. That's good.
27221	Dr. Cox	I'm tired. Maybe he's from the International Pretentious Association and he's here to remove your goatee.
27222	Jordan	So, what do you have? A boy or a girl?
27223	Patient	I have a little girl. I don't get to see her often enough. See, um...I don't know, a few years ago I had a little, business problem.
27224	Jordan	What was your business?
27225	Patient	Import-export. Yeah, I would import heroin into my bloodstream. I would export vomit, urine in, uh, whatever alley would have me as a guest.
27226	Jordan	Oh, sorry. That's the little smile I get when I'm silently judging someone.
27227	Patient	Anyway, the thing is, it's Jenny's sixth birthday on Monday, and uh, I'm not really sure that I can fly out and make it. It's uh, it's hard to get a job. You know, money's tight. I've got hospital bills that I can't pay.
27228	Jordan	Sam, I am so sorry.
27229	Patient	Yeah...
27230	Turk	I know who he is!
27231	Elliot	Just one little problem...
27232	Patient	OH MY GOD, just give me the drugs, 'kay, lady? For God's sake, I've been working you from every possible angle...
27233	Turk	That's the junkie who conned Elliot into giving him meds.
27234	Laverne	Just got interesting, people!
27235	J.D.'s Narration	The Janitor was wrong. My interns weren't laughing at my jokes just because I'm their boss. It made me think about how some people don't want to just open the door...
27236	J.D.'s Narration	...walk in, and see the truth.
27237	Elliot	Why did you come here Carla?
27238	Carla	You're mad at me? Why didn't you want me to come to your job?
27239	Doctor #1	Hey Bankfarter, if you want, we're all going down for lunch.
27240	Elliot	You tell me.
27241	J.D.'s Narration	After all, the truth can reveal the ugliest part of people.
27242	Turk	That guy has conned damn near everyone in this hospital. I've got to warn her.
27243	Turk	Jordan...whoa!
27244	Dr. Cox	She wanted to work here, so let her see what it's like to work here. And for God's sake, will you be a man?
27245	J.D.'s Narration	As for me, I already knew exactly what the truth was. Plus, my best friend was always around to back me up.
27246	J.D.	How funny is this joke? That patient's tumor is so big, it's starting to look like a three-mor. Huh, huh, huh.
27247	Keith	Three-mor! You are hilarious, Dr. D!
27248	Turk	Awful. It's awful. Awful.
27249	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
27250	Open	Doctor's Lounge. J.D.'s interns are assembled for a talk from J.D. J.D. paces.
27251	J.D.'s Thoughts	OK, be cool. They're just kids. Except Gloria. What is her deal?
27252	J.D.	OK, guys, let's talk for a second as equals, all right? Seriously, I'm taking off my stethoscope, and my little name tag, I'm not a doctor right now.
27253	Lisa	You're still wearing scrubs.
27254	Rex	We are in a hospital, man.
27255	J.D.	OK, we're off the property. Now let's talk.
27256	Jason	Shouldn't we wait for Gloria?
27257	Gloria	Coming!
27258	J.D.	We'll catch her up later. Have you guys been fake laughing at my jokes? Be honest. I promise, absolutely no ramifications.
27259	Keith	Well, we've been kind of fake laughing.
27260	J.D.	Keith, I hope you die a violent death and bugs eat your corpse.
27261	Keith	Look! Your jokes kinda suck and when I laugh, you pick me to do procedures.
27262	J.D.	Unbelievable. From now on, there 's absolutely no laughing at my jokes unless they're particularly hysterical! Talk about your mission impossibles, huh, huh, huh, huh.
27263	Janitor	Case closed.
27264	J.D.	What is it with you and the costumes today?
27265	Janitor	I borrowed it from my brother. He's a stripper.
27266	Gloria	I'm I'm here!
27267	J.D.	Gloria.
27268	Elliot	Look, Carla, I didn't want you to come here because, well...Look, there's so much great about you. You're smart, you're loyal, you've absolutely shattered all of my preconceived notions about chicanos.
27269	Carla	Elliot, bring it.
27270	Elliot	You're a bit of a gossip.
27271	Carla	So? I'm interested in people's stories.
27272	Elliot	Thanks to you, for the rest of my career I have the world's worst nickname.
27273	Carla	Bankfarter's not so bad, it sounds German.
27274	Elliot	Don't make fun of my people, Carla!!
27275	Doctor #2	Hey, Bankfarter, did you hear? Charlie found a successful gene therapy for OI. He basically cured the disease.
27276	Elliot	How did he have any time to work when he was always torturing me?!
27277	Doctor #2	Jealousy's an ugly color, Bankfarter. Anyway, we're discontinuing your fellowship.
27278	Elliot	Frick. Frick-frick-frick-frick-frick-frickity-frick-FRICK-FRICK!! Frick.
27279	Jordan	I'm not sure how people go about doing nice things, but here.
27280	Jordan	You should be there for your daughter's birthday.
27281	Sam	I can't take that.
27282	Jordan	Come on. I can't even Botox an ear with this.
27283	Dr. Cox	Oh. Would everyone please watch this? Because nobody, but nobody cries like Sammy. He leads off with the chin quiver...
27284	Dr. Cox	Then he goes right to the look-away.
27285	Dr. Cox	He tries to hold it back but he just can't because there's too much pain!
27286	Dr. Cox	And then, finally, he squeezes out one single tear.
27287	Dr. Cox	Ladies and gentlemen, that is some quality crack-addict theater!
27288	Turk	I can't watch this.
27289	Laverne	Then move your big, bald, biscuit head! Some of us don't have cable.
27290	J.D.	This is a little trust exercise that I really think is gonna connect us again. Remove your blindfolds, please.
27291	J.D.	See your death, see your death, see your death...
27292	J.D.	Keith...
27293	J.D.	Don't worry, buddy. We're cool.
27294	Keith	Really?
27295	J.D.	No! See your death.
27296	Keith	No! But I looked up to you!
27297	J.D.	Hey! Why don't guys go upstairs and do some work!
27298	J.D.	And for God's sake, will somebody wake up Gloria?
27299	J.D.	OK, enough waving. You wave too much. You abuse waving. Go!
27300	Dr. Kelso	There it is, just like I said. I can feel your hatred like a cool spring breeze. Ah!
27301	J.D.'s Thoughts	Gloria.
27302	Elliot	I can't believe I don't have a job!
27303	Carla	Is that even yours?
27304	Elliot	I need your support right now, Carla! Carla, you can not tell Turk and J.D. about this until I get back on my feet again.
27305	Carla	Why? They'll just feel bad for you.
27306	Elliot	No, they'll be merciless. Seriously, if you tell, I will never trust you again with anything.
27307	Dr. Kelso	Where've you been?
27308	Carla	Nowhere!
27309	Dr. Mickhead	What are you doing?
27310	Carla	Nothing!
27311	Janitor	Where's Blonde Doctor?
27312	Carla	Geez!
27313	Laverne	What's the dish?
27314	Carla	I gotta go.
27315	Turk	Hey!
27316	Carla	No hablo inglés!
27317	Turk	Oh my God, you got that little bit of saliva on your lip that says you know something juicy!
27318	Carla	No, I don't.
27319	Turk	Here it comes! YES?
27320	Carla	OK! Here's the scoop!
27321	Turk	Yes! Here is the scoop indeed.
27322	Carla	You gotta promise not to tell.
27323	Turk	I know...
27324	Jordan	Sam, what are you doing back here?
27325	Sam	Hey, lamb chop, uh, crazy story. I was taking a bus to my plane ticket, there was an accident and thank God I'm alive, I hugged him and then...
27326	Sam	...aaargh, rrrroo, ha ha.
27327	Dr. Kelso	Jordan. Ah, this is one of our most famous con-artists-slash-drug-addicts.
27328	Sam	Nice to see you, sir.
27329	Dr. Kelso	You as well. Turkleton! You've dealt with him before.
27330	Sam	Hey, dude.
27331	Dr. Kelso	Why didn't you tell her?
27332	Turk	Because he told me not to!
27333	Dr. Cox	This is gonna cost you.
27334	Turk	Get off my back, I'm not in the mood. Whoa!
27335	J.D.	OK, say it again!
27336	Turk	Get off my back, I'm not in the mood?
27337	J.D.	That's what she said! Zoom, zoom, zoom!
27338	Elliot	OK. I'm sure you know about, go ahead. Take your shots!
27339	Turk	You've got bug-eyes.
27340	J.D.	Just because you dye your mustache blonde doesn't mean it's gone.
27341	Elliot	That's all you have to say?
27342	Elliot	Excuse us.
27343	Elliot	Oh my God, you kept my secret!
27344	Carla	I know! I almost told them, too, but I didn't. Because I love you.
27345	Elliot	Carla, I love you, too!
27346	Carla	Oh, I had to tell Turk something, so you smoke a pipe now.
27347	Elliot	Oh! Coolio!
27348	Carla	What's wrong?
27349	Turk & J.D.	Well...
27350	J.D.	We were gonna do "multi-ethnic Siamese doctor has a Fresca," but then Turk started getting on my case about my interns.
27351	Turk	He's mad because they're sucking up to him and I was saying, "Dude, that's the exact same thing you did with Dr. Cox."
27352	J.D.	You know what? Put our right hand in front of your face. Now talk to it!
27353	Elliot	J.D., he's right. If you want to be a jerk attending too, go ahead. But don't do it because they resent you. That's not fair.
27354	Turk	Dude, get up, I gotta go to the bathroom.
27355	J.D.'s Narration	As I stood up to go to the men's room with Turk, praying he only had to go one-sies, I thought about the different methods people use to teach.
27356	Dr. Cox	Oh, uh, I wasn't sure if you wanted to give him more money, or skip the middleman all together and actually give him narcotics. So I went ahead and brought your ATM card and a, uh, heroin sandwich.
27357	Dr. Cox	It's not heroin. It's smoked turkey.
27358	Jordan	So, you thought if you made me look like a fool, I'd quit. Is that it?
27359	Carla	So, Jordan, I heard Sam got you. Don't worry, he totally suckered me once.
27360	Laverne	When I first started, I lent my car to a patient to go pick up her kid. Last time I ever saw that IROC. Hm.
27361	Turk	Remember that meningitis patient that stole your identity?
27362	J.D.	Darryl! He's cool. From now on he's only going to use my credit card for emergencies!
27363	Dr. Cox	It's a rite of passage that you have to go through around here to be accepted.
27364	Jordan	Oh, my God, you actually did something nice for me!
27365	Dr. Cox	No, no. No-no-no-no-no-no-no. It was a selfish act. If other people talk to you, you won't have to talk to me!
27366	Jordan	Cute.
27367	J.D.'s Narration	I think it's always easier to be a jerk than a good guy.
27368	Keith	Did we do something wrong Dr. Dorian?
27369	J.D.	No, you guys are fine. You're doing a good job.
27370	J.D.'s Narration	Still, good guy or not, there's no reason why you shouldn't enjoy the perks.
27371	J.D.	You know what? I want the laughter back!
27372	J.D.	And you know what, I liked it when you waved, you were always waving...Why don't all of you just wave? All right.
27373	J.D.'s Narration	Ultimately, you can deal with anything, as long as you have a group of friends around to go through it all with you.
27374	Jordan	Hey, guys. What's going on?
27375	J.D.'s Narration	I can't imagine what it would be like if I were all on my own.
27376	Elliot	Excuse me, um, could I just borrow your help-wanted section? Thank you.
27377	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
27378	Open	Turk's and Carla's Apartment - Kitchen.
27379	J.D.'s Narration	Since I was currently homeless, Turk and Carla were letting me crash here as long as I needed.
27380	Carla	J.D., you have to get out. This place is tiny and I'm sick of seeing your man-panties hanging all over the bathroom.
27381	J.D.	They're called boxers, Carla.
27382	Carla	They're satin, J.D.
27383	J.D.	With a breathable cotton crotch panel.
27384	J.D.'s Thoughts	King me!
27385	Elliot	Ugh, I need to find someone to split the rent at my place.
27386	Turk	I thought you were getting good money at your new fellowship.
27387	Elliot	So first, I lose my fellowship because some jackass cures the disease, and now the only job I can get is working at this crappy free clinic for eight bucks an hour. No one's life could be worse than mine.
27388	Elliot	Uh, the fellowship's great.
27389	Elliot's Thoughts	Oh God, Carla, please don't tell them I'm working at a free clinic!
27390	Carla's Thoughts	I sense she doesn't want me to tell them. Women have an unspoken connection men can't even fathom.
27391	J.D.'s	Thoughts: Dude, I know you can't look because Carla's here, but you're missing a crazy Victoria's Secret commercial.
27392	Turk's Thoughts	I'm watching Giselle in my spoon right now!
27393	Turk	You know, you you two could solve both of your problems if you just moved in together.
27394	Elliot	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa and whoa...
27395	J.D.	Whoa, hold your horses.
27396	Elliot	We have a very complicated past.
27397	J.D.	I I hurt her and I'm not very proud.
27398	J.D.'s Thoughts	I'm a little proud.
27399	Elliot	We've managed to restore our friendship by staying away from dangerous topics.
27400	J.D.	You know, relationships and things of that nature.
27401	Elliot	J.D. and I keep it superficial.
27402	J.D.	Love the superficial. Dynamite teeth today.
27403	Elliot	Oh, thanks, buddy!
27404	J.D.	Sparkly!
27405	Elliot	Yeah!
27406	Carla	Fine, you can't live with Elliot, but you're not living with us, so get your crap out by Friday.
27407	J.D.	Friday?
27408	Carla	Friday.
27409	J.D.	Friday's my birthday! I've already e-vited everyone over to our place.
27410	Carla	Whose place?
27411	J.D.	Your place. Look I can't just un-e-vite everyone, I've already gotten two e-yeses and twenty-four e-maybes. That's a lot of e-sponses.
27412	Carla	Bambi, I'm gonna put my e-foot up your ass.
27413	J.D.	It's a Mexican-themed fiesta on the first anniversary of my 29th birthday. That means I'm turning 30. Donde? 56 Walnut Drive. Cuando? Thank you for asking. Ocho-thirty until upside-down question mark. Sombreros at the door. Arrrrrrrrrooo!
27414	Turk	I'll be there.
27415	J.D.	Gracias, amigo. I borrowed one of your dictionaries.
27416	J.D.'s Narration	Since there were twelve surgical residents at Sacred Heart fighting for four attending spots, Turk was ass-kissing the senior staff.
27417	Dr. Wen	Oh, damn. I left my briefcase upstairs.
27418	Turk	Excuse me a second.
27419	J.D's Narration	Turk thought he was the only one who heard that.
27420	Turk	Dr. Wen! Dr. Wen, I've got your br
27421	Turk	I had no idea there were that many Asian surgeons in this hospital.
27422	Todd	I got your back, T-dog.
27423	Turk	Then let it begin.
27424	Turk	Quit fooling around with those guys and get down here!
27425	Todd	Yaaahhh! Here comes the big dog!
27426	Turk	Dude, thanks for having my back.
27427	Todd	Yeah. Betrayal five.
27428	Todd	Hey buddy. Betrayal five.
27429	Turk	OHHH!
27430	Todd	Dr. Wen!
27431	Dr. Wen	Oh, my briefcase.
27432	Todd	Yeah.
27433	J.D.	You know, I totally saw that coming.
27434	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
27435	Open	Hospital parking lot. Turk and J.D. are walking in to work.
27436	Turk	Dude, look at you! Thirty years old! All growed-up.
27437	J.D.	Oh really, Turk? Because the Sacred Heart sign I vandalized last night begs to differ.
27438	J.D.	Hey remember when we were in college we made lists of all the stuff we wanted to do by the time we turned thirty?
27439	Turk	Yeah.
27440	J.D.	Check it!
27441	Turk	Things to do by thirty: Get married, buy a house, learn the difference between "Senator" and "Congressman." Dude, you haven't done any of these yet.
27442	J.D.	I know, but who cares? I got all the time in the world. I mean I'm only turning thirty.
27443	Kid	Thirty? What's thirty?
27444	J.D.	Where did all of these unsupervised children come from?
27445	Turk	So you wanted to talk to me about your appendectomy, Mrs...Appendectomy? Now that ain't right!
27446	Patient	Look, 15% of all surgical complications are anesthesia-related, so I would like to use hypnosis instead of the traditional anesthesia.
27447	Turk	Well I'd like to sleep with Beyoncé tonight instead of my wife, but that ain't happening either, you know what I'm saying?
27448	Turk	Tell you what, I'll think about it.
27449	Turk	My appendectomy patient wants me to use hypnosis instead of anesthesia.
27450	Dr. Cox	Lookit, I'd like to throw it in Gwen Stefani tonight instead of Jordan, but that ain't gonna happen either.
27451	Carla	Dr. Cox!
27452	Turk	Dr. Cox! No! Awful!
27453	Carla	Hypnosis is a very powerful tool. It's helped people with depression and weight loss. It helped me to quit smoking.
27454	Dr. Cox	Hypnosis is for birthday parties and bad Vegas lounges. Now you go tell your patient to let you do what you do best. Knock her out and then start digging around inside of her like a blind man looking for a nickel.
27455	Carla	I think you should do it.
27456	Dr. Cox	Knock her out and dig.
27457	Carla	Do it.
27458	Dr. Cox	Dig.
27459	Carla	Do it.
27460	Dr. Cox	Dig.
27461	Carla	Do it.
27462	Dr. Cox	Dig.
27463	Turk	OK. I'm gonna go with Dr. Cox on this one.
27464	Dr. Cox	That's a rookie move and you hate to see it. You always side with the wife, even if she's got a full-blown case of the crazies.
27465	Carla	Turk, we're gonna have kids soon. We're supposed to be a team. That means you occasionally have to listen to me and believe in my opinion. But what if we have a daughter and she wants to get her ears pierced?
27466	Turk	Irrelevant. We're not having a daughter.
27467	Carla	OK, what if we have a son and he wants to take dance class even though all his friends are playing football?
27468	Turk	He can dance if he wants to. He can leave his friends behind. 'Cause his friends don't dance and if they don't dance, then they're no friends of mine! S-S-S-S-A-A-A-A-F-F-F-F-E!
27469	Carla	Then I said, what if our son wants to take dance classes instead of play football with his friends? And Turk ran off singing "Safety Dance."
27470	Elliot	Carla, didn't you learn your lesson that time you told him Der Kommissar was in town?
27471	Carla	Yeah...
27472	Elliot	Ooh! Someone's leaving!
27473	Dr. Cox	Huh.
27474	Carla & Elliot	We saw it first.
27475	Dr. Cox	Jordan, here's the plan. I'm gonna go ahead and cram an entire evening's worth of drinking into the next five minutes. Now, you just make sure not to engage them. Be particularly aware of the blonde, talky one. I've worked with her before. She has no off button.
27476	Carla	If money's so tight, why not have Jake move in with you?
27477	Jordan	Who's Jake?
27478	Dr. Cox	Jordan! No.
27479	Elliot	He's this guy I've been going out with for awhile, but we're not ready to move in. He's a little closed off, you know?
27480	Jordan	Uh, sweetie? Are you aware of who I live with?
27481	Dr. Cox	Jordan Godzilla Sullivan, you stop that, and you stop it now!
27482	Jordan	Why don't you try talking to humans for once? You might enjoy it!
27483	Carla	Elliot, maybe you should be the one to open Jake up. You know, like Turk can be a little immature, you know, like I always have to talk about my feelings over dinner or shut off his iPod during sex. I bet you could do the same thing with Jake.
27484	Dr. Cox	Or, maybe you could pressure him, get dumped, throw on fifty pounds, start collecting knick-knacks and meet your future now, you know, before the loneliness burns too much? Whoaaa-ahahahahaha! Gosh, I did enjoy that!
27485	Turk	Dude, you haven't done anything on this list. How could you never have slept naked on a hammock?
27486	J.D.	I'm afraid of dragonflies. You know what, I'm not gonna make a big deal out of this. Neither one of us has made any headway with our lists.
27487	Turk	First of all, don't lump me in with you, because I'm a surgeon, I'm married, I've had sex while playing Frogger and I'm gonna be a dad. I'm moving through my list.
27488	J.D.	I've done nothing. I mean I did learn another language, but it was just that one where you slid a "b" sound in the middle of every single word, and I was never fluent.
27489	Turk	That secret language was so lame.
27490	J.D.	No-b-t with the la-b-di-b-es...
27491	Turk	Dr. Kelso! Do you have any idea who's gonna get those three attending spots next year?
27492	Dr. Kelso	There are four spots for next year.
27493	Turk	Three, if you're not counting the one going to me!
27494	Dr. Kelso	I'm gonna stick with four, Turkleton. See, there are numerous skilled surgeons here at Sacred Fart.
27495	Dr. Kelso	Did you see the sign? Though there will be no vandalism here, people! It was classic. Anyway, the key is to do something that will get noticed.
27496	Turk	I don't know if you know this, but tomorrow I'll be doing an appendectomy using hypnosis instead of anesthesia.
27497	Dr. Kelso	Well, it's about time. Hell's bells, son, when I say the name Turkleton, people laugh.
27498	Turk	Maybe because that's not my name.
27499	Dr. Kelso	Not yet, Turkleton. Not yet.
27500	Jake	Elliot, I don't think I understand what you want.
27501	Elliot	I just want you to open up, you know, emotionally, spiritually.
27502	Jake	Well, I'm not exactly religious, you know, but I do think that God watches over my family and my favorite sports teams. Oh, and once in tenth grade He made Jennifer Martin sleep with me.
27503	Elliot	OK. How about opening up sexually? What's your wildest fantasy?
27504	Jake	Yeah, it's not happening.
27505	Elliot	Come on! Sometimes in bed I feel like I'm the only one screaming.
27506	Jake	Elliot, you're quiet as a mouse. All that screaming is in your head.
27507	Elliot	Yeah, but in there, it's crazy...mmmmmm.
27508	Jake	All right, fine. Why don't you tell me your wildest fantasy?
27509	Elliot	OK, fine. You're a Mexican apple thief, I run the cider house. I catch you hiding behind the stone mill, you chase me into the tasting room. Oh, if there's a crow in there, fine, if not, I can live with it. Anyway, we're all alone, you don't speak a word of English, but you teach me more about hard cider than I ever learned from my fermenting exams and our passion is so loud they can hear it all the way in the distillery...
27510	Elliot	Oh. God, I can be such an apple slut.
27511	Jake	OK.
27512	J.D.	When did we lose Mr. Heath?
27513	Carla	Oh, we didn't, his vitals are fine.
27514	J.D.	Doug, I told you to stop pre-tagging patients.
27515	Doug	It's a slow day in the morgue, nothing's written in stone.
27516	J.D.	You wrote a time of death.
27517	Doug	I wrote one-ish.
27518	J.D.	Get out of here!
27519	Carla	Why are you so pissy?
27520	J.D.	Carla, at 6:41 tomorrow evening I turn thirty. I have to find one thing on this list I can do by then.
27521	Dr. Cox	Maybe you could swing by our parts department and pick up a pair of testes.
27522	J.D.	Haven't you used that joke like, a trillion times?
27523	Dr. Cox	I'm OK with it.
27524	Carla	Invent a cereal? Complete a triathlon?
27525	Dr. Cox	There's a triathlon tomorrow, Thing One and Thing Two have been training vigorously for it.
27526	Doug	We're working on our drafting technique!
27527	Dr. Cox	If your goal is to repel all women on the planet, then it's definitely working.
27528	Ted	Ignoring him...and switch!
27529	J.D.	That's it! I'll do the triathlon!
27530	Carla	Oh, you don't know anything about triathlons!
27531	J.D.	Well, I didn't know anything about cereal-inventing either, Carla. And yet if it wasn't for a harshly-worded cease and desist letter, we'd all be eating J.D.'s Bananas and Nuts.
27532	Carla	You're not serious about this, are you?
27533	J.D.	Why is everybody wearing wetsuits?
27534	Doug	Because the water's like 49 degrees, dum-dum.
27535	Ted	So what's your best time, buster?
27536	J.D.	Honestly, Ted, it doesn't really matter. As long as I finish by 6:41 tonight.
27537	J.D.'s Narration	The harder you push yourself to do something, the harder it is to back out. Whether you're caught in a lie with your wife...
27538	Carla	I heard you were doing the hypnosis surgery. You actually listened to me.
27539	Turk	Hell yeah, I listened to you, baby! Come on. That's the reason I'm doing it right? Because of you and how well I listen.
27540	Carla	I love you.
27541	Turk	Love you.
27542	J.D.'s Narration	Or whether you're just trying to get your boyfriend to open up.
27543	Elliot	Come on, Jake, come in there and show me what you're really like. No one is going to judge you.
27544	Elliot	Oh my God, Jake!
27545	Jake	You want to talk about it, Elliot?
27546	Elliot	Nope!
27547	J.D.'s Narration	And sometimes, the only thing you can do is just dive in.
27548	J.D.	Ooh! Oh boy, that's cold! Oh God! Ahh! There's a little, here's some more, all right, ease it in, ease it in!
27549	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
27550	Open	The ocean. J.D. swimming the triathlon.
27551	J.D.'s Narration	As I sidestroked through the salty waters of the great Pacific...
27552	J.D.'s Thoughts	Pick an apple, put it in your pocket. Pick an apple, put it in your pocket...
27553	J.D's Narration	...I wondered if everyone was doing as well as I was.
27554	Turk	Why are all these cameras here?
27555	Dr. Kelso	Turkleton, this is quite the event here at Sacred Fart.
27556	Dr. Kelso	I can't help it, it kills me. Yeah, we got visiting doctors, video crews, even that Japanese news anchor who slept with me when I convinced her I was an oil tycoon. If she comes over here, my name is T-Bone.
27557	Dr. Cox	We're also getting a good bit of interest from the seismologist at Cal Tech who, I understand, will be able to chart the magnitude of the scream emanating from your hypnosis patient, as well as, of course, the numerous after-screams that are sure to follow.
27558	Turk	No interviews!
27559	Carla	Turk. Turk! Where are you going?
27560	Turk	I can't do this. I don't believe in any of this hypnotism crap! I only needed to impress Kelso!
27561	Carla	Oh, so great, you lied to me!
27562	Turk	I'm about to ruin my career by plunging a knife into a completely conscious person! But you know what? You're absolutely right. Let's focus on the lying.
27563	J.D.'s Narration	As I reached the biking stage and finally realized what chafing was, I got a surprise visitor.
27564	Elliot	How's it going?
27565	J.D.	Well, my bike is rusty, I haven't been able to feel my genitals since they first touched water, and the only thing I've had to eat all day is half a jellyfish. Why are you here?
27566	Elliot	Can I talk to you about Jake?
27567	J.D.	That's a dangerous topic, talk to Carla.
27568	Elliot	Yeah, any time I talk to Carla about a guy, she tells me to marry him so the four of us can go to dinner together.
27569	Intern	I've been dating this guy for a few weeks, but I just found out he went on a gay cruise last month.
27570	Carla	Probably a cheap trip. Marry him and the four of us will have dinner.
27571	Intern	But he also said he might be gay.
27572	Carla	Dinner!
27573	J.D.	Talking to you violates the two most important tenets of our relationship. One, keep discussions superficial and two, no talking while my boys are straddling chrome. That one's new.
27574	Elliot	Why don't you just try a higher gear?
27575	J.D.	Agh! It's like pedaling in hummus!
27576	Elliot	See you, buddy!
27577	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, thank God, I think the bike part is finally over. Oh no.
27578	J.D.	Whoooooooaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!!! Whoaahhh OOF!
27579	Janitor	I can play with signs, too!
27580	Turk	This is great. I'm being assisted by a magician.
27581	Carla	The only way you're going to get through this is if you believe it's going to work.
27582	Turk	Yeah.
27583	Carla	OW!!
27584	Turk	That was just a fingernail, honey, how would you like it if I cut out your appendix?!
27585	Carla	Let's just forget for one second that hypnosis is used to lower bleeding, help recovering patients deal with pain. You are married now. So start believing what I tell you to believe.
27586	Carla	And don't pinch me!
27587	J.D.'s Narration	During the run, dehydration set in.
27588	Ted	Hang in there, buddy!
27589	Doug	See you at the luau!
27590	J.D.	They already finished and cooked a pig?
27591	Elliot	Hey, J.D.
27592	J.D.	Oh, you're real. Although the dolphin costume is a little odd.
27593	Elliot	This Jake thing is still really bothering me.
27594	J.D.	Elliot, you know our rules.
27595	Elliot	Yeah, I've been thinking about that. Who wants to have a superficial friendship? And, God, do you remember how close we used to be? Dealing with Dr. Cox,
27596	J.D.	This is working.
27597	Elliot	Not for me, I want to be able to tell you that my boyfriend really freaked me out.
27598	J.D.	Well, if he freaked you out, why don't you and talk to him?
27599	Elliot	I don't know. You tell me.
27600	J.D.	All right, fine, Elliot. You want to know why? You're just like me. You're scared because you feel like you haven't accomplished anything with your life. But instead of running a triathlon, you're pushing forward with a guy you don't belong with. And you know as well as I do that one of these days, he's going to open up a bottle of white wine for you when you really prefer red, except you never told him that and you want to know why? It's because he's not right for you, Elliot. Are you happy now?
27601	Elliot	You're pretty smart for a guy running in bike shoes.
27602	J.D.'s Thoughts	Must. Finish. Race.
27603	Turk	You can do this. You can do this.
27604	Turk	What are you saying to her?
27605	Hypnotist	You can do this. You can do this.
27606	Turk	Small world. Scalpel. Making first incision.
27607	Turk	Well, here goes.
27608	Turk	Hmm? All right. Clamp, please!
27609	J.D.'s Narration	They say that in life, all good things must come to an end. Sometimes it comes quietly...
27610	Elliot	I like red.
27611	Jake	You do?
27612	Elliot	Jake, I think we need to talk.
27613	J.D.'s Narration	...and sometimes, not so quietly.
27614	Turk	Oh-b-no-b..
27615	Hypnotist	You can do this! You can do this! You can do this!
27616	J.D.'s Narration	And suddenly, you realize you've taken something as far as you can go.
27617	Turk	What the hell was I thinking?
27618	Carla	Turk. You did great, baby.
27619	Dr. Kelso	She's right, Turkleton. Hell, without anesthesia you made it halfway through a surgery. I bet you could publish that.
27620	Dr. Cox	Maybe they'll put it in "Almost" magazine.
27621	Dr. Kelso	You know, Perry, it wouldn't hurt you to make some noise around here.
27622	Dr. Cox	How's this? Blow it out your ass, Bob.
27623	Carla	See? My baby made some noise!
27624	Turk	Yeah, I made some noise all right.
27625	Elliot	J.D., what you said before, I knew you were right. Anyway, I'm sorry I got mad.
27626	Elliot	Thanks. You were wrong about one thing, though. We are moving forward.
27627	J.D.	Elliot, I'm thirty years old. I'm single, I'm homeless, and I'm pretty sure I just soiled myself.
27628	Elliot	Why don't you just move into my place?
27629	J.D.	Oh, great. Then we'll be two losers under one roof.
27630	Elliot	By my watch, you've got eight minutes to finish this thing. Come on!
27631	J.D.'s Narration	A wise man once said the human spirit can overcome any obstacle.
27632	J.D.	I can't...
27633	Elliot	Come on.
27634	J.D.'s Narration	That man had obviously never run a triathlon.
27635	Elliot	Come on. Hooooooooorgh! You're not really helping! Rrgh!
27636	Carla	Are you sure this is the finish line?
27637	Turk	I think I see him.
27638	J.D.'s Narration	As for me, I could overcome any obstacle, as long as I had Elliot and her ridiculously strong thighs beneath me.
27639	J.D.	Woo-hoo! We made it! And with two minutes to spare!
27640	J.D. & Elliot	Whoa!
27641	Turk	Baby, I'm not carrying him to the car.
27642	Elliot	Promise to help me get through my thirtieth?
27643	J.D.	Mm-hmm. Will you tell me what Jake's fantasy was?
27644	Elliot	Nope.
27645	J.D.	Did it involve chains?
27646	Elliot	No.
27647	J.D.	Whips?
27648	Elliot	Mm-mm.
27649	J.D.	Candle wax?
27650	Elliot	No.
27651	J.D.	Role-playing?
27652	Elliot	No.
27653	J.D.	Lasers?
27654	Elliot	Mm-mm.
27655	J.D	Hamsters?
27656	Elliot	Negative.
27657	J.D.	Was he a Mexican apple thief?
27658	Elliot	If only.
27659	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
27660	Open	Elliot's apartment. J.D. is on the couch. Elliot enters with a bag of groceries.
27661	J.D.'s Narration	I really missed living with Turk. But living with Elliot wasn't that bad.
27662	Elliot	Hey, roomie! I'm having the girls from my yoga class over for drinks tonight and FYI, Tina, the tiny brunette just got dumped and she's looking for rebound sex. Honestly, how could I be a better roommate?
27663	J.D.'s Thoughts	She could be half Turk and half Elliot.
27664	Turk/Elliot	Hey dog, if you die before me, I'll let you play with my boobies while I finish.
27665	J.D.	I died, Turk-iot. Hellooo!
27666	Elliot	J.D., what are you doing?
27667	J.D.	Nothing.
27668	Elliot	Because it looked like you were thinking about fondling my breasts, and if that's the case, then stop thinking and start fondling.
27669	Turk	Dude, what the hell are you doing?
27670	J.D.	I miss having you as my roommate, I don't know!
27671	Turk	Check it out. Keith's telling Mr. Morrison about his brain tumor.
27672	J.D.'s Narration	Seeing an intern tell someone they're going to die for the first time is strange. Because even though it's a horrible and sad experience, if they get through it, there's a sense of accomplishment.
27673	Keith	Nailed it! Hell yeah!
27674	J.D.	Good job, man. What did you say?
27675	Keith	Well, I just told him that there's nothing more we can do right now.
27676	Turk & J.D.	Ooh!
27677	Keith	What?
27678	J.D.	"Nothing more we can do right now" implies that there maybe something we can do tomorrow.
27679	Keith	Well, I also said that we'd make him as comfortable as possible.
27680	Turk	Sounds like someone's going to get new pillows and a comforter.
27681	Keith	That man knows he's doomed!
27682	J.D.	Yeah, I'm gonna need you to go back in there and use some form of the word "die." Dead, dying, deadsies, deadwood. Your choice.
27683	Keith	What was the middle one?
27684	J.D.	Deadsies.
27685	Turk	Deadwood?
27686	J.D.	Did you know cowboys used to curse?
27687	Turk	I didn't know that.
27688	Ted	Gather round, people, Dr. Kelso has an announcement to make!
27689	Dr. Kelso	That'll be all, Ted. You can go back to doing whatever you were doing.
27690	Ted	It was my day off.
27691	Dr. Kelso	Due to lack of funds, I'm shutting down our baby-mobile, which means there will no longer be free prenatal care for underprivileged women. Bottom line, if you're thinking about knocking up a homeless gal, I'd do it this weekend.
27692	Dr. Kelso	Thank you, Colonel Doctor.
27693	Colonel Doctor	Excuse me?
27694	Dr. Kelso	I'm sorry, I don't know your name and you look like that Kentucky Fried Chicken guy. Moving on. This Friday I am receiving an award from the A.M.A.
27695	Dr. Cox	"Jerk-off of the Year." No, "Bastard of the year." Ah, don't you tell me, "Guy I Despise So Much I'd Pay Someone To Kill You and Stuff You and Leave You By My Bed So That When I Wake Up In the Morning, I Can Roll Over and Punch You in the Face...of...the Year."
27696	Dr. Kelso	And, we're back. Anyway, I need one of you attendings to introduce me at the dinner, so figure it out.
27697	J.D.	How do we handle this?
27698	Dr. Cox	Same way we have for years.
27699	Dr. Cox	First one who falls introduces Kelso.
27700	J.D.	Unfortunately for you guys, I have the balance of a...
27701	J.D.'s Thoughts	Careful, you're about to let Dr. Cox know you were a gymnast in high school.
27702	J.D.	Fine. Let's do this. Wheels up.
27703	J.D.	OK, come on Dorian. Find your center. Round the rosy! Hey! I got it! I don't got it!
27704	J.D.	Whoa. Whoa. Reel it in, Take it clockwise, fight your fear!
27705	J.D.	Come on. Come on. Be the chair. You gotta want it Johnny D! You gotta want it! Woooooo!!
27706	Dr. Cox	Oh! Tough break, there, Newbie.
27707	Dr. Cox	Group! Position right...Ho!
27708	Dr. Cox	I don't know, but I believe...
27709	Doctors	I don't know, but I believe...
27710	Dr. Cox	Newbie's going to...
27711	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
27712	Open	Dr. Cox and J.D. walking in the hall towards the Admission's Area.
27713	J.D.	So, I have to introduce Dr. Kelso. Big whoop.
27714	Dr. Cox	I don't think you understand the predicament you are in here. Kelso expects a long, glowing testimonial. The kind that make men cheer and women...What is that women do, Newbie?
27715	J.D.	How the hell would I know?
27716	J.D.'s Thoughts	They swoon.
27717	Dr. Cox	Look, if you get up there and start kissing Kelso's ass, your fellow attendings will forever think of you as a brown-nosing toadie. On the other hand, if you don't pucker up, Kelso will make your life a living hell. You're officially trapped.
27718	J.D.	I'll just say something nice about him that's actually true.
27719	Dr. Cox	You go do that, and I'll go find God, quit drinking, get in touch with myself emotionally and we'll meet right back here at half past impossible. OK?
27720	J.D.	Everyone has a human side, Coxy. Even Kelso.
27721	Laverne	The hell he does. I remember a flu epidemic. He lost half a dozen children in one day. Hmm!
27722	Laverne	The second Kelso's foot hits the bottom of those stairs, he doesn't have a care in the world.
27723	J.D.	You know, Laverne, I'm a doctor. So I'm not really gonna take my psychological evaluations from someone who dispenses them in between watching "Maury" and eating a corn muffin.
27724	J.D.'s Thoughts	OK, that was too mean. Apologize.
27725	J.D.	Laverne, I...
27726	J.D.'s Thoughts	Ah, the hell with it. She's not gonna forgive you, go for broke!
27727	J.D.	I was watching CNN earlier. Apparently the terror alert in your armpits has been elevated to orange. Oh, no he didn't. Yes, Laverne, he did.
27728	Janitor	"Laverne, I'm a doctor." You're a bit of a know it all, aren't you?
27729	J.D.	Well, I know a lot.
27730	Janitor	Yeah? Who was Deep Throat?
27731	J.D.	Mark Felt, the F.B.I. guy. That's been all over the news for months.
27732	Janitor	Oh, sorry, rich boy. My TV doesn't get the news. Just the bible channel and some kind of Chinese boxing. I bet you don't know how to play Jiggly Ball.
27733	J.D.	That's because there's no such thing.
27734	Janitor	Ha ha! I knew you didn't know.
27735	J.D.'s Narration	I knew if I just followed Dr. Kelso around for a little while, he'd eventually do something decent. I'm a master of stealth. I could sneak up on anybody.
27736	Dr. Kelso	Why are you following me?
27737	J.D.	Sir, aren't you being a little paranoid?
27738	Dr. Kelso	I was in Nam, you know. They pulled off my fingernails.
27739	J.D.	When did you get an earring?
27740	Dr. Kelso	Enid, I'm not cheating on you, this earring is mine.
27741	Dr. Kelso	See?
27742	Dr. Kelso	It's a hip-hop world, son. Keep up or get out of the way.
27743	J.D.	I've got to get an earring.
27744	J.D.	Turk, have you heard of Jiggly Ball?
27745	Turk	Yeah, it's a game the orderlies made up.
27746	J.D.	I've heard of it, too. It's so awesome that we've both heard of it.
27747	Turk	Yes, that that's awesome.
27748	Turk	Mr. Keck, what do you say we get you into surgery and take care of that hernia!
27749	Mr. Keck	Um, I don't know if surgery is necessary. Last night, I was in pain so I went to a free clinic. The doctor there said surgery wasn't my only option.
27750	Turk	Well, you're just going to have to get him on the phone and tell him that I won't be second opinioned by a clinic doctor who couldn't carry my jock strap! Give me some!
27751	J.D.	Here it is!
27752	Turk	Ho!
27753	Elliot	Yeah, I think I know this guy. Is he a cocky, black doctor with a white doctor following him around and looking at him like he's in love?
27754	J.D.	You'd make a pretty girl.
27755	Mr. Keck	Yeah.
27756	Elliot	All right, now repeat after me...
27757	Mr. Keck	You can't decide for me, that's not your duty.
27758	Elliot	And are they both trying not to laugh at word "duty?"
27759	Mr. Keck	Yeah. Hey, Heckle and Jeckle, you know what? No surgery.
27760	Turk	Who the hell is this?
27761	Male Voice on Phone	Where are my shoelaces?
27762	Elliot	I said to tell him that he had a laxity in the peritoneal wall and that surgery was unnecessarily invasive, was that so hard?
27763	Dr. Cox	Mr. Morrison, I understand that one of our interns spent an hour in here telling you over and over that you were going to die. I would make him apologize personally, but I'm having him spend the rest of the day checking that counter top's heartbeat.
27764	Keith	Sorry, Mr. Morrison
27765	Dr. Cox	Keith! I think Mr. Countertop would really appreciate your undivided attention.
27766	Dr. Cox	Now, the hospital is running an experimental drug trial on a medication that they're hoping will reduce the size of tumors. Well, I'm gonna try my hardest to get you in there.
27767	Mr. Morrison	I really appreciate that, sir.
27768	J.D.	Ahh, checking Mr. Countertop's heart rate.
27769	J.D.	Memories. Did you know that once Dr. Cox had me give every air conditioning unit in this hospital a pap smear? The wacky thing was, room 403 did have some yeast issues.
27770	J.D.	Oh, Dr. Cox, this intro is killing me. Have you seen Kelso?
27771	Dr. Cox	Nope. But, our new patient, Mr. Franks, in here is crazy rich, so I'd imagine big Bob will be here momentarily to make love to his money clip
27772	Dr. Kelso	Hi. Bob Kelso.
27773	Dr. Kelso	Listen up, bozos. That gentleman over there is basically a cash piñata waiting to be whacked open. So how about someone diagnoses him so I can get my candy.
27774	Dr. Cox	I'll be glad to do it, Bob, if you'll do me a favor and put my patient, Mr. Morrison, in that experimental drug trial.
27775	Dr. Kelso	Sure, what the hell.
27776	Dr. Cox	Deal.
27777	J.D.'s Thoughts	Finally, I had something I could say in my speech. Dr. Kelso was an angel.
27778	Elliot	Look, Lorraine, the sooner you let me have a look at that rash, the sooner we can get you back home...I mean, back on the street, which is your home. Hey, home street home, huh? I'm sorry, Lorraine, that was incredibly insensitive.
27779	Elliot	Frick!
27780	J.D.	So this is where germs are born...
27781	Elliot	I can not believe that you told these guys!
27782	Turk	Elliot, she didn't. My patient told me that his clinic doctor was this blonde-haired woman who talked so fast and in such a high-pitched voice when she was upset her words eventually became gibberish.
27783	Elliot	I really do not talk like that. I'm getting pretty tired of you guys constantly saying...
27784	Carla	Elliot, sweetie, nobody but me can understand you.
27785	Carla	That's just Turk. You know that's how he is.
27786	J.D.	You knew she worked here? I can't believe you kept a secret. Remember before your wedding when you sold me out to Turk?
27787	Carla	J.D., you showed up drunk at my shower screaming through tears that I'd never be as emotionally connected to him as you are.
27788	J.D.	Turk knew I was joking.
27789	J.D.'s Thoughts	Because we're so emotionally connected.
27790	Turk	Elliot, nobody respects clinic doctors.
27791	Elliot	Really, Turk? I think your hernia patient does.
27792	Turk	I'm not upset about that!
27793	Carla	It's obvious you are.
27794	J.D.	It's more obvious to me, baby. I mean, Turk.
27795	Elliot	Look, I know this place isn't the greatest, but it's not like I lie awake thinking about being yelled at by Dr. Cox and playing Jiggly Ball with the orderlies.
27796	J.D.'s Thoughts	How do I not know about this game?
27797	Elliot	At this clinic I get to practice medicine for people who really need me. I mean, honestly, I feel like I belong here.
27798	Orderly	Dr. Kool just got stabbed in the parking lot and we're all out of gauze. Is it cool if I take lunch?
27799	Elliot	This place is crushing my soul.
27800	J.D.	Can you believe Elliot's working at a free clinic?
27801	Dr. Cox	Who?
27802	J.D.	Dr. Reid?
27803	Dr. Cox	I'm sorry, that's just not ringing a bell.
27804	Carla	She and J.D. used to sleep together.
27805	Dr. Cox	J.D.?
27806	J.D.	That's not even funny.
27807	Dr. Cox	Priscilla, I honestly, on my mother's grave, thought your real name was Carol.
27808	Carla	Whoa, whoa, you want to hear a weird coincidence? The pathology just came back on Dr. Kelso's rich patient. He has the same brain tumor as your guy, Mr. Morrison.
27809	J.D.'s Narration	I don't know why we were running. Because I think we both knew that we couldn't change anything. Because given a choice between a rich guy and a poor guy, it was pretty obvious who Bob Kelso would put in the drug trial and who he'd leave behind.
27810	J.D.'s Narration	Another banner day at Sacred Heart.
27811	J.D.'s Narration	A best friend stuck in crappy job...
27812	J.D.'s Narration	A nice guy slowly dying without a fighting chance...
27813	J.D.'s Narration	It's a wonder how anyone can walk out of this place with a smile on their face.
27814	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
27815	Open	Hospital Admissions Area.
27816	Carla	We have to help Elliot get her job back.
27817	Turk	Honey, there's no money to hire another attending.
27818	J.D.	Maybe though, Dr. Bailey was fired last night.
27819	Carla	Why?
27820	Dr. Bailey	For this procedure, I'm going to have to numb you. "Num-num-num-num-num..."
27821	Turk	You know, in Dr. Bailey's defense
27822	Carla	No, no, no, no, no.
27823	J.D.	There have been times
27824	Carla	No.
27825	Carla	So anyways, we figure, if I offer to do the nursing schedules and these guys volunteer to do extra shifts at the clinic, Dr. Kelso might give you your job back.
27826	Elliot	No, thanks.
27827	Carla	Why?
27828	Elliot	Carla, I can't do your paperwork, I am swamped.
27829	Carla	I got you your job back.
27830	Elliot	Turk, I am not giving you my last tater tot!
27831	Turk	I got you your job back.
27832	Elliot	J.D., I don't care if they're able to successfully attach one person's limbs on to another person's body, I am not giving you my hands.
27833	J.D.	Job back.
27834	J.D.	It's just a beautiful film. Beautiful. Corn?
27835	J.D.	Oh, let me help you. I got it.
27836	J.D.	You're tickling your hands. Wait, stop, you're tickling your hands.
27837	Elliot	Buttery!
27838	J.D.	OK, keep going, I enjoy it, actually.
27839	J.D.	Ah, I'm only two and a half years away from chest hands.
27840	Elliot	I have to handle this on my own, OK?
27841	J.D.	See? These are chest hands.
27842	Turk	That's what I'm talking about.
27843	J.D.	Course, yours would be brown.
27844	J.D.'s Narration	The next day started poorly. I only had eight hours until Kelso's awards dinner and someone else was boxing me out.
27845	Dr. Cox	Hey, Bob, I need to talk to you about my drug trial patient.
27846	Dr. Cox	Ah, we lost him.
27847	Dr. Cox	Bob? I can see you.
27848	Dr. Cox	Oh, for God's sake, you're three-dimensional.
27849	Turk	It's true, Mr. Keck, you can probably get by without the surgery. But why would you? I'm the smartest, most skilled surgeon in this place.
27850	Mr. Keck	Are you stuck in that candy machine?
27851	Turk	I paid for my Rolos, I'm getting my Rolos!
27852	Mr. Keck	Mm-hmm.
27853	Carla	Nice! Why aren't you mocking him?
27854	J.D.	Dropped a quarter in here.
27855	Carla	Guys, listen. We really need to help Elliot.
27856	Turk	Baby, she said she doesn't want to be helped.
27857	Carla	If J.D. were drowning and he told you he didn't want you to save him, wouldn't you do it?
27858	Turk	That depends. What if there are hot chicks at the pool? Maybe he wants one of them to jump in and save him.
27859	Carla	Let's say there's no women.
27860	Turk	There's always women at the pool, baby.
27861	Carla	Fine, he's in a pond.
27862	J.D.	Oh, I would never swim in a pond, they're infamous for serpents.
27863	Turk	You could swim at the Y on Tuesdays. Men only.
27864	J.D.	Have you been to the Y on man night? Not me.
27865	Carla	OK, fine! Turk's the one who's drowning.
27866	Turk	Oh, so now a brother can't swim!
27867	J.D.	Why do you have to go there?
27868	Carla	Oh my God! I would rather play Jiggly Ball than try to explain this to you two idiots.
27869	J.D.'s Thoughts	She's the idiot. We're doctors.
27870	Dr. Cox	Bob, I'm physically touching your arm now. Oh, come on, I know you're here.
27871	Dr. Kelso	Oh, hi, Perry, what can I do for you?
27872	Dr. Cox	Anyway, I just wanted to introduce you to our chief of medicine.
27873	Mr. Morrison	Sir, I can't tell you how well everyone's treating me.
27874	Dr. Kelso	That's what we're here for.
27875	Dr. Cox	You, uh, you forgot to tell him you were bumping him from the drug trial.
27876	Dr. Kelso	I've got work to do, Perry.
27877	Dr. Cox	You're not going anywhere.
27878	Dr. Kelso	Are you hearing that?
27879	J.D.	What kind of glass is this?
27880	J.D.	Ow?
27881	Dr. Kelso	There was one spot open in the study. I gave it to the rich guy because with the money he's now donating, I can reopen the prenatal unit.
27882	Dr. Cox	What really bothers me is that you can look in there at John Morrison, a guy that you essentially gave a death sentence to, and just not care.
27883	Dr. Kelso	It's not my job to care, Perry.
27884	J.D.	Can I talk to you for a second?
27885	Janitor	No, I'm busy cleaning.
27886	Janitor	That one always kills.
27887	J.D.	Do you remember earlier when I told you I'd never heard of Jiggly Ball? I was joking. I play all the time.
27888	Janitor	I like this. It's an idiot handle.
27889	J.D.	Get off.
27890	Janitor	As it happens, we're heading out right now to play some Jiggly Ball. Are you in?
27891	J.D.'s Thoughts	Just say no!
27892	J.D.	Jiggle me in.
27893	Janitor	All right, you're gonna go first. Please enter the Jiggly circle.
27894	Janitor	Everybody else, on my signal prepare to throw.
27895	J.D.	Throw?
27896	Janitor	Now.
27897	Janitor	Now, anyone who caught a Jiggle rebound, may step up to the Death Line.
27898	Laverne	I want you to think of this as a corn muffin.
27899	J.D.	Oh!
27900	J.D.	There is no such thing as Jiggly Ball, is there?
27901	Janitor	No.
27902	J.D.	Guys, why?
27903	Carla	The Janitor told us that if we pretended to know about Jiggly Ball, we'd get to throw tennis balls at you.
27904	Turk	And I couldn't pass it up, dude!
27905	Elliot	I got my shift covered!
27906	J.D.	I could see where it would be funny from the outside of the circle.
27907	Ted	YAAAAAHHHHH!!
27908	J.D.	AAH!!
27909	Ted	Hey, Kelso's leaving for his award thing, so if you want to talk to him about Dr. Reid, do it now.
27910	Elliot	I told you guys to leave it alone.
27911	Carla	Would you stop being so proud?
27912	Elliot	I'm proud? Carla, after the wedding you wouldn't even take Turk's name.
27913	Carla	I use it for official things.
27914	Elliot	Letting him call you Mrs. Turk in the bedroom isn't official.
27915	Turk	But it is officially hot!
27916	Elliot	And Turk, you freaked out when the hernia patient listened to me over you, and J.D., you just let the entire hospital pummel you with tennis balls because you were too proud to admit you didn't know what Jiggly Ball was.
27917	J.D.	I think there may be something wrong with my spine, because I'm not doing that.
27918	Carla	Elliot, look, we just care about you.
27919	Elliot	Yeah, well, don't worry about it. I'll get back on top on my own.
27920	Dr. Kelso	Chop-chop, Dorian.
27921	J.D.'s Narration	Even though I had no clue what I was going to say, Elliot's attitude inspired me to introduce the hell out of Bob Kelso.
27922	J.D.	Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Bob Kelso is...
27923	Dr. Kelso	Thank you, Dr. Dorian. Thank you so much for this award. I'm delighted to see you all...
27924	Dr. Cox	Did I say he wanted a long introduction? Because Kelso just he just likes it when people say his name. Hope you didn't obsess too much about that, Newbie.
27925	J.D.'s Narration	Over the next few weeks, I couldn't help thinking about what I had planned to say in my speech. And about how pride defines who we are.
27926	Orderly	This guy has an STD and he definitely doesn't want his wife to find out.
27927	Dr. Kelso	Crap.
27928	J.D.'s Narration	As far as Bob Kelso goes, I know some of the good things he does are for the wrong reasons.
27929	Dr. Kelso	I'd like everyone to welcome back Dr. Reid.
27930	J.D.'s Narration	Still, I also know that I wouldn't want to have to make any of the decisions that he makes.
27931	J.D.	But when all is said and done, I like to think he does care a little.
27932	J.D.'s Narration	Even if he's too proud to show it.
27933	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
27934	Open	Hallway.
27935	J.D.'s Narration	After four years, I know the hospital so well I can sneak in a little nap walk before rounds.
27936	J.D.'s Thoughts	Two quick steps to the left to avoid Overly-Ambitious Orderly.
27937	J.D.'s Thoughts	Hop over the dead guy Doug's dragging because he lost his gurney again.
27938	Doug	The man's dead, J.D. Show some respect.
27939	J.D.'s Thoughts	And finally, Dr. Kelso's 9AM wrong shoulder tap.
27940	Dr. Kelso	Dammit. Every morning, tapping. No one's ever there!
27941	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, you can't be ready for everything.
27942	Janitor	Hey! Help me move this weekend.
27943	J.D.'s Thoughts	We scoff...
27944	J.D.'s Thoughts	...And we walk away.
27945	Dr. Cox	Remind me again why you're having our son baptized.
27946	Jordan	Oh, what do you care? You're not even going.
27947	Dr. Cox	Fine, let him go to church. I mean, I let him go to magic shows, I'll just tell him it's all a lie when he gets home so he doesn't have any of those crazy nightmares.
27948	Jordan	By the way, I invited your sister.
27949	Dr. Cox	Jordan, please tell me you didn't.
27950	Jordan	Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie, I didn't realize you'd be so upset. I'll call her and tell her not to come. Ha ha! How weird would it be if I was like that?
27951	Carla	Totally.
27952	Jordan	Weird.
27953	J.D.	When is this joyous occasion?
27954	Dr. Cox	You're not invited.
27955	J.D.	Oh, I see. Family only, everyone, that's how they're doing it.
27956	Carla	I'm going.
27957	Dr. Cox	Newbie, give me a break. Of course you're going. As a matter of fact, I'd I'd like you to be the boy's godfather.
27958	J.D.	I am honored.
27959	Dr. Cox	I am lying.
27960	J.D.	I'm not sure I see how that's funny.
27961	Elliot	Uh, what's with the second beeper?
27962	Turk	Carla gave it to me. She's got me on twenty-four hour baby-making alert, and we haven't had sex since her last ovulation. Did you know that women only do that once a month?
27963	J.D.	Of course I knew that, Turk, I'm a doctor.
27964	J.D.'s Thoughts	Once a month? That's crazy!
27965	Elliot	I don't know why I even bother ovulating. Little Haley doesn't have a chance this month. I name my eggs, big frick. Last month, it was Cassie.
27966	J.D.	Ooh, Cassie's pretty.
27967	Elliot	Oh, she would have been, J.D., she would have been.
27968	Dr. Cox	Everyone! This is my sister, Paige. Paige, I'd like you to meet random people I don't care about.
27969	Dr. Kelso	Ahh! Here for the baptism. I remember my son, Harrison's big day. All of us laughing at him in his frilly little baptism dress. Well, we're not laughing anymore, Harrison's a poofter. Bob Kelso.
27970	J.D.	Hi, I'm J.D. I'm sure Perry's spoken of me.
27971	Paige	No...
27972	J.D.	Nothing about taking a talented go-getter under his wing, or being a surrogate father to a boy who's lost his own? Nothing about that at all, I'm surprised. That's interesting to me, but OK.
27973	J.D.'s Thoughts	Don't cry in front of people.
27974	Paige	Perry and I don't talk much.
27975	J.D.	Oh, they don't talk much, everybody. There's no talking in the family.
27976	Dr. Cox	Rest assured, Newbie, even if we did talk from morning till night about all big and tiny things that matter most to me, the big being my son, Jack, cure of cancer and the resurgence of the hard-shell taco. The small
27977	Paige	The small being my ex-wife, Jordan, wind energy, and, ah he-he-hell, fruit-infused liquors, your name still would not have come up.
27978	Dr. Cox	I'm honestly not sure which one of you I find more irritating.
27979	J.D.	What does he find irritating about you?
27980	Dr. Cox	Fire at will.
27981	Paige	I embrace the Lord, Jesus Christ as my personal savior.
27982	J.D.'s Thoughts	I'm not sure why it was suddenly so awkward, but I wish something would break the tension.
27983	Turk	Hallelujah! A brother's 'bout to have some sex. Ha-Ha-Hallelujah! A brother's 'bout to have some seeeeeex! Smack the money maker! Smack it!
27984	J.D.	That's how he likes it.
27985	Turk	Awww, sex time, people!
27986	J.D.	He's married, so it's strictly procreation sex! His wife's throwing her legs up in the air because they're trying for a boy....Like Jesus.
27987	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
27988	Open	ICU
27989	Paige	You know what used to drive Perry nuts as a kid? Every night we'd play Horse in the driveway, and I'd always kick his ass.
27990	J.D.	Can Christians say "ass" now? I have a friend, Pat Casey, he called his mom an ass once. She hit him in the face with an iron. He still goes to church, but he can't whistle anymore.
27991	Paige	OK. I'm gonna go say hi to Jordan.
27992	J.D.	She's dynamite. How'd you end up with a born-again Christian sister?
27993	Dr. Cox	I don't know. Maybe the TV was broken one day and she picked up the bible instead and found it to be just a darn good read. Or maybe it had something to do with our mother's ability to watch silently as our dad drunkenly knocked us from room to room. What do you think there, Newbie?
27994	J.D.	Probably the room to room thing.
27995	Dr. Cox	Uh-huh.
27996	J.D.'s Narration	It's always hard to find the right words in a moment like this.
27997	J.D.	Dr. Cox, if it makes you feel any better, at the baptism I'll be there to keep Paige company.
27998	Dr. Cox	Yeah. You're not going.
27999	J.D.	Dammit! Stupid baptism.
28000	Turk	I'm gonna have some sex! I'm gonna have some se-AAAHHHH!
28001	Carla	OK, my cervical mucus is peaking, my temperature is slightly elevated, and these pillows will keep my vagina angled so the semen can pool against my cervix.
28002	Turk	Baby, that is some god-awful dirty talk.
28003	Carla	Turk, we're making a baby, now let's get down to business.
28004	Turk	Honey, I need to feel the heat. I need at least 30 minutes of foreplay. Then, and only then can I be fully ready to make love to you.
28005	Carla	Tyra Banks.
28006	Turk	Yeh...
28007	Carla	There, you're ready.
28008	Janitor	Oh, hey fellas, I'm trying to give someone the evil eye over there. Would you mind breaking it up so I can...you understand.
28009	Janitor	Thanks, fellas, very nice of you. Appreciate it. Thank you.
28010	J.D.	He's just mad because I won't help him move.
28011	Jordan	Well you should have done it. Helping someone move is like oral sex. You do it once and they owe you for life.
28012	Elliot	My high school boyfriend is an accountant and he still does my taxes for free. You what's weird, he also does my brother Barry's.
28013	Dr. Kelso	My son, Harrison, dabbles in sadomasochism and he has a new gimp named Barry. Or is it Larry? At my age it's getting harder and harder to keep track of his gimps.
28014	J.D.'s Narration	And then it occurred to me. This was the perfect opportunity to take an enemy and turn him into a friend.
28015	J.D.	I'll do it.
28016	Janitor	I knew you would. You're very predictable.
28017	J.D. & Janitor	No I'm not. Stop doing that. Peanut butter egg dirt!
28018	Dr. Cox	Newbie, let's go, Mr. Donnelly's test results are in.
28019	J.D.'s Narration	It's never easy to tell a family that medicine isn't working.
28020	Dr. Cox	I uh, I wish I had better news for you. Unfortunately we're not seeing the improvement we'd hoped for with his medication.
28021	Mrs. Donnelly	What are our options?
28022	Dr. Cox	I'm afraid there are no other options.
28023	Paige	There's always prayer.
28024	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh no.
28025	Paige	You know, with God by your side, anything is possible.
28026	Dr. Cox	Could I see you in Stop-Filling-My-Patient's-Head-With-False-Hope ward?
28027	Dr. Cox	Paige, we have protocol here. First, we shake our magic eight ball, then we explore all witchcraft-related options.
28028	Paige	Oh, right, because people who believe in God are crazy. And you're the sane one.
28029	J.D.	Hey, do you guys like improv? Because I'm kind of an expert. There's a game we play in class where you make up what people are saying. Like, watch: Do you want some pie? Not me, I hate pie. What are you talking about? Who hates pie? Everyone loves pie. I've always hated pie! You never understood me. You're a pie racist! Well, you're a cobbler whore!
28030	J.D.'s Thoughts	For God's sake, get off pie!
28031	Paige	Jerk.
28032	Dr. Cox	Republican.
28033	J.D.	Pie.
28034	J.D.	I've got to find an improv class that doesn't meet in the back of a pie shop.
28035	Turk	Ugh. Dammit, I've gotta go have ovulation sex again.
28036	J.D.	Ar you actually complaining about getting to have sex? Because that is so insensitive, Turk.
28037	Turk	J.D...
28038	J.D.	Let me feel my feelings, Turk! We worked on this!
28039	Turk	I really gotta stop doing that.
28040	Elliot	You can talk to me if you want.
28041	Turk	Elliot, I can't talk to you about sex, I can't understand any of that crazy gibberish you use. Penis is, shwing-something.
28042	Elliot	Swhing-shwong, peepers or peep.
28043	Turk	Right, and vagina is...?
28044	Elliot	Disgusting, but also bajingo or hoo-hoo.
28045	Turk	Here's the deal. I'm trying to get in the mood, right? And Carla's going on and on about her cervical mucus.
28046	Elliot	Uh-bup-bup. Mmm-mm. From now on cervical mucus will be referred to as icky-sticky.
28047	Turk	Icky-sticky.
28048	Elliot	Continue.
28049	J.D.	Morning, sunshine!
28050	Dr. Cox	Never. Say that. Again.
28051	J.D.	Noted. That was quite a fight you had with your sister yesterday. Won't it be a little awkward when you show up at St. Mary's cathedral on the corner of Maple and Pine, right across from Temple Oheb Shalom at 4 PM today?
28052	Dr. Cox	That's not where the baptism is, but nice try.
28053	J.D.	Mark my words, when that little bastard is dipped in water, I will be there.
28054	Dr. Cox	Anyway, I just invited Paige to come by, Mr. Donnelly's labs came back. It looks like the steroid is finally working. If you happen to be keeping score at home, that would be Medicine: 1, God: 0.
28055	J.D.	You don't have to rub it in her face.
28056	Dr. Cox	Yeah, and I don't have to stick Dr. Kelso's stethoscope down my pants every morning, but I still do. Now isn't there some other relationship out there you could be trying to fix?
28057	J.D.'s Narration	Actually, there was.
28058	J.D.	Morning, sunshine.
28059	Janitor	I don't like that.
28060	J.D.	Nobody seems to.
28061	Janitor	Well, come on. Let's grab some boxes and get to moving, huh?
28062	J.D.'s Thoughts	I hope I can find a way to connect with him.
28063	Janitor	Thanks for saving that. That's one of my favorite pieces.
28064	J.D.	You're welcome, friend.
28065	J.D.	I gotta say, you've got a lot of Asian art around here.
28066	Janitor	When I was kid, I always thought I'd travel the world, you know? So after college, I went to China. Did all the normal touristy things, I saw the Great Wall, ate the food, had a baby with a local. You know, just the regular stuff. Anyway, I guess I decorate my place this way because it reminds me of a more optimistic time. That probably sounds crazy.
28067	J.D.	Doesn't sound crazy at all.
28068	Janitor	Thanks, buddy.
28069	J.D.'s Thoughts	And like that, I was in.
28070	Turk	Damn!
28071	Carla	I paged you an hour ago.
28072	Turk	I was in surgery.
28073	Carla	Is that doughnut glaze on your cheek?
28074	Turk	Guess we're not having sex, huh?
28075	Carla	Ohh, no we're having sex. Get in there.
28076	Turk	Wait, baby, I'm too full.
28077	Carla	Now, Turk!
28078	Turk	Man!
28079	J.D.	Long story short, after confirming it with my bunk mates, that counselor and his "friendship lotion" were transferred out of our cabin and we never spoke about it again.
28080	Janitor	Well, what doesn't kill you...
28081	J.D.'s Thoughts	We're as thick as two thieves in a pod.
28082	Janitor	OK. Time to move some of the heavier stuff. So you might want to put on these gloves. And the attic upstairs has a lot of fiberglass in it. So here's a hat.
28083	J.D.	Thanks, pal.
28084	Janitor	Sure, bud.
28085	J.D.'s Narration	I figured out why I'm so great at managing relationships. I don't rub things in people's faces.
28086	Dr. Cox	I thought you might like to know that your husband's chest X-ray look better. He is finally starting to improve.
28087	Mrs. Donnelly	Thank you so much.
28088	Dr. Cox	I was really just doing my job.
28089	Mrs. Donnelly	Oh, I'm talking to Paige. She was up all night praying with us.
28090	Carla	You big jerk!
28091	J.D.'s Narration	I never go to bed very, very mad.
28092	Turk	Angry sex is awesome.
28093	J.D.'s Narration	And I've always known that if I make the slightest gesture of friendship to a difficult coworker...
28094	Asian man	Who are you?
28095	J.D.'s Narration	...I'll end up robbing an Asian couple's house.
28096	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
28097	Open	Street. J.D. runs full speed with the Buddha statue as two dogs chase him.
28098	J.D.'s Narration	I couldn't help wondering what the sentence was for stealing a Buddha. After all, people get pretty sensitive about religion.
28099	Dr. Cox	Could I comment on the baptism dress?
28100	Paige	I think you should wait until you see the matching slippers and tiny handbag.
28101	Dr. Cox	You're actually asking him to cross-dress on the same day that you're introducing him to a religion that will condemn him to hell for it. That's a trauma two-fer.
28102	Jordan	Can you two please just try to get along? Now I'm getting some blush for Jack because this lace collar is washing out his face. Terrible.
28103	Dr. Cox	Paige, will you just acknowledge that medicine made Mr. Donnelly better?
28104	Paige	Fine. It was medicine.
28105	Dr. Cox	Uh-huh.
28106	Paige	Thank God for creating medicine.
28107	Dr. Cox	Eh- J- Gh -Gh- That's it! That is it!
28108	Dr. Cox	Now, you you may be a total goner. But God's not getting His hands on this one. No way, no how. Come on, Jack. We got places to go.
28109	Carla	Turk, I'm ready!
28110	Turk	All right. So angry sex is awesome. But that's no reason to go down a bad road.
28111	Turk	Baby, you know what I miss? When your body was kickin'.
28112	Turk	I ain't touching no damn diapers. WAAAAHHH!
28113	Turk	Baby, all I'm saying is that in some European countries it's perfectly acceptable for a man to have a mistress.
28114	Carla	Why you
28115	Carla	I'm gonna make you pay for every word you said!
28116	Turk	Worth it!
28117	J.D.'s Narration	Now that I'm on the lam, I thought about two things. One, what my prison name would be...
28118	J.D.	Gizmo.
28119	J.D.'s Narration	And two, whether some relationships were beyond repair. Then fate threw me another curve.
28120	J.D.	Hey, who's your friend?
28121	Dr. Cox	My boy in a dress. Who's yours?
28122	J.D.	Well, seeing as he gave me the strength to outrun the Sheriff's K-9 unit, I'd say he's my new god.
28123	J.D.	You can rub mine's belly if I can rub yours.
28124	Dr. Cox	Don't you touch my son.
28125	Turk	Angry sex is like a drug. I can't stop.
28126	Carla	I'll be right out, I'm just fixing my hair.
28127	Turk	Rake's in the closet, baby.
28128	Turk	Help me!
28129	Elliot	Turk, just go back to the way things were. Carla loved it. Don't you get it? Trying to make a baby with you is the sexiest thing in he world to her.
28130	Turk	Elliot, I'm a man. I've been programmed to think that a baby is the worst possible consequence of sex.
28131	Elliot	Well, it's not.
28132	Elliot	Honey for my honey!
28133	Boy	Why are you stopping?
28134	Elliot	Losing a baseball scholarship because a bear ate your arm is a much worse consequence of sex.
28135	Turk	You have to help me end this angry sex cycle.
28136	Carla	I'm ready.
28137	Elliot	Oh, Carla, Turk's making you mad on purpose because the angry sex is so good. Ahhh, the cycle is broken.
28138	Dr. Cox	There will be no whining or crying while we sit here, understood?
28139	J.D.	He seems fine.
28140	Dr. Cox	I wasn't talking to him.
28141	J.D.	I don't whine or cry.
28142	Janitor	Really. How do you explain these photos of you whining and crying as you run away from the Kwan's apartment?
28143	J.D.	These are coasters.
28144	Janitor	My camera's broken.
28145	J.D.	You turned me into a felon!
28146	Dr. Cox	You know what, there, Newbie? You can go to the baptism. Take Jack. Jordan will kill me if he's not there. Plus, I know you. You're exactly one watered-down appletini away from trying to fix my sister and me.
28147	J.D.	No, thank you. If there's one thing I learned from this guy, it's that I need to stop trying to fix people's relationships.
28148	Janitor	You're welcome.
28149	J.D.	Still. I've never know you to judge a person based on their beliefs. In fact, you're pretty tolerant of everyone. Except Hugh Jackman.
28150	Dr. Cox	Eh.
28151	J.D.	I just don't understand why your sister being religious bothers you so much.
28152	Dr. Cox	It doesn't.
28153	J.D.	Then why are you so angry?
28154	J.D	So, do you like pie? Look at me. Do I look like a guy who doesn't like pie? I love pie. Incidentally, where do you by your loincloths?
28155	Jordan	I-I don't think I can do this without Perry. I mean, he's my everything.
28156	Paige	You're right. It would be weird if you were like that.
28157	Jordan	Right?
28158	Paige	Yeah.
28159	Jordan	Yeah.
28160	Turk	I just don't understand why we can't have fun.
28161	Carla	I am so glad you had to hurt my feelings to have fun.
28162	Turk	I can't believe you! Calm down!
28163	Carla	Calm down? I am going to kill you.
28164	Turk	You hear that? She's gonna kill me. Get her.
28165	Elliot	OK, look. You two stop fighting or I will turn this church around.
28166	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes I think it takes a child to make you see the light.
28167	Elliot	Isn't he beautiful?
28168	Turk	Yeah. He is.
28169	Paige	Oh, wow! Has anyone ever told you you're an extremely average athlete?
28170	Dr. Cox	Oh, that's cold, sis. That's ice cold. You know, uh, I've been thinking about why I hate seeing you so much.
28171	Paige	Please, Perry, don't hold back.
28172	Dr. Cox	It's not the God stuff. I've worked hard to try to forget everything about our childhood. But when I see you, I-I can't think about anything else.
28173	Paige	It's hard for me, too.
28174	Dr. Cox	But I don't see why you can't be there for the major events in Jack's life.
28175	Paige	I'd love to see him turn three.
28176	Dr. Cox	The major events, Paige? His graduation, his wedding, his divorce, his funeral. The big four?
28177	Paige	I beat you at Horse, he has a church wedding.
28178	Dr. Cox	Done.
28179	Paige	That went in, didn't it?
28180	Dr. Cox	Did you thank the G-man for that?
28181	Paige	That was all me, baby.
28182	Dr. Cox	Yeah, it was.
28183	J.D.'s Narration	So maybe relationships can be fixed. Whether it's by coming around to your spouse's way of thinking.
28184	Turk	Carla, I'm sorry. I didn't get how this baby-making stuff could be sexy. But I do now.
28185	Carla	Well, you know, Turk? I can't get angry if you give me a little help.
28186	Turk	]in Carla's ear] If you had no hair, you'd look like Danny DeVito.
28187	Carla	Aww, Turk, a little help.
28188	J.D.'s Narration	Or by reassuring the Kwan's that their big guy didn't desert them.
28189	J.D.'s Narration	In the end, you just have to be willing to take the first step.
28190	Dr. Cox	By the way, Jack's birthday is in the spring...sometime.
28191	Paige	March 21st. Bye, Perry.
28192	Dr. Cox	Bye, Paige. You know, Paige is a silly name.
28193	Paige	Perry's worse.
28194	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
28195	Open	Street. J.D. is riding down the street in his scooter helmet and goggles.
28196	J.D.'s Narration	Since my scooter was in the shop, I didn't know how I was going to get to work today. But luckily, my neighbor, Ronald, lent me his ride.
28197	J.D.'s Narration	Ronald's six. But I still got there in time to steal the security guard's Arts and Leisure section.
28198	J.D.	Hello!
28199	J.D.'s Narration	Around here, everyone has some sort of morning ritual. Whether it's getting help on the daily word jumble from the dyslexic tracheotomy patient...
28200	Elliot	Uh, T-E-I-P-O-P.
28201	Patient	Potpie.
28202	Elliot	Save your voice, Marcia. Mm. Save it.
28203	J.D.'s Narration	...Cursing out an innocent orderly over a stolen physical therapy tub....
28204	Dr. Kelso	Dammit, you'd better find it! Physical therapy tubs don't just disappear!
28205	J.D.'s Narration	...Or for some, just a relaxing afternoon soak on the roof.
28206	Todd	Oh come on, let me in. This totally covers my boys.
28207	Janitor	You try to get in here wearing that thing and I'm gonna give you a four-story atomic wedgie.
28208	J.D.	Wah! My eyes!
28209	J.D.	Well, yeah, it hurts. But when you accept the keys to the hog, you become a lifetime member of the danger club. Excuse me, fine ladies. I've got lives to save.
28210	Elliot	Ronald's gonna be mad.
28211	J.D.	Yeah, well he's six. What's he gonna do, kick my ass?
28212	J.D.'s Thoughts	Again.
28213	Elliot	Hey, check this guy's chart out. He says he's been in pain for, like, three months.
28214	J.D.'s Narration	For doctors, pain is complicated. Every patient handles it differently, depending on their race...
28215	Asian Patient	Does what hurt?
28216	J.D.'s Narration	...gender...
28217	Husband	Ow! I just bit the inside of my lip! Agh! Nothing's ever hurt so badly!
28218	J.D.'s Narration	...or even their sex life.
28219	S&M Guy	OHHHHHH....yeah, that feels good.
28220	J.D.'s Narration	And since there's no way to truly gauge how much pain someone's in, we have to rely on an archaic chart.
28221	Elliot	Mr. Peele, you're about a seven on the pain chart.
28222	Elliot	Yep, you're a seven.
28223	Mr. Peele	What's a ten?
28224	J.D.	That's a ten.
28225	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
28226	Open	ICU J.D. walks past the Nurse's Station.
28227	J.D.'s Narration	After four years here, I'm finally comfortable with helping myself to the nurses' muffin basket.
28228	J.D.'s Thoughts	Mmm...Blueberry-cran-carrot-zucchini-poppy-seed-chocolate chip!
28229	J.D.	All right, everybody, last one here has to do a double shift this weekend.
28230	J.D.	Keith! Looks like you just lost your weekend.
28231	Keith	What? I totally beat Lisa.
28232	J.D.	Lisa, call that androgynous husband of yours and tell him or her you're mine this weekend.
28233	Lisa	But I feel like I edged out James.
28234	J.D.	OK, my bad, so we're not crystal clear on the ground rules. OK, tomorrow it will be the last one to touch my face. Nah, I'm not gonna like that. The last one to touch my bot No, that's probably illegal. I tell you what, I'll just email everyone. That's what I'll do. This day and age that's what you do. OK, over here. Guys, Mr. Jenkins spent all night without being treated. Now, I know he's homeless and smell's like an obese man's twosie.
28235	Mr. Jenkins	Hey!
28236	J.D.	Sorry, thought you were dozing. The thing is, guys, it doesn't matter if he's a homeless guy or some senile old racist.
28237	Mr. Bursick	Which people do I hate again?
28238	J.D.	Immigrants, Mr. Bursick. You hate all immigrants.
28239	Mr. Bursick	And why do I hate
28240	J.D.	I don't have time, Mr. Bursick. Guys, if I give you a patient, I expect you to work your butts off for him. And P.S., Mr. Jenkins is a Vietnam vet. So let's take care of him like he took care of our nation. Get out of here!
28241	J.D.	That's how you light a fire under their butts, Perry, you get 'em going with some inspiration!
28242	Dr. Cox	Too much talking, too much talking, too much talking, too much talking, too much talking, too much talking. Why did you order a BMP test on my patient, Mrs. Wilk, last night?
28243	J.D.	Because she's my patient.
28244	Dr. Cox	Interesting, seeing as *I* admitted her
28245	J.D.	and *I* treated her last night.
28246	Mr. Bursick	Dr. Dorian, why do I hate all
28247	J.D.	Because they're stealing all of our jobs, Mr. Bursick, stealing all of our jobs. Perry, we've spent an equal amount of time on Mrs. Wilk, and seeing as we're both attendings, i.e. equals, why don't we let her decide who her doctor is, huh?
28248	Dr. Cox	Or, we could skip the day trip to Unnecessary-land and instead, simply concede that Mrs. Wilk is *my* patient and while we are both attendings, we are in no way equals. We are, in fact, not equals. We are...mmmm...un-equals.
28249	Mrs. Wilk	I choose Dr. Dorian.
28250	J.D.	Oh my God. Oh, my God, I don't even believe it! I don't believe it! I don't believe it-lieve it-lieve it! Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo! Yes! I'm shaking, look at this. It's crazy talk.
28251	Mrs. Wilk	He played hearts with me all night.
28252	Mrs. Wilk	You're a very strange young man, aren't you?
28253	J.D.	I was a premie.
28254	Elliot	Mr. Peele, I have run everytest and I cannot find any medical reason for your pain.
28255	Mr. Peele	GUUHH!
28256	J.D.'s Narration	Then Elliot did what every good doctor does when they're truly stumped. She pawned him off.
28257	Elliot	I've called a surgical consult.
28258	Mr. Peele	Nnnnye.
28259	Turk	Help has arrived! Help has arrived.
28260	Elliot	Ha. Turkleton!
28261	J.D.'s Narration	And then Turk said what every surgeon says when they're not sure what to do.
28262	Turk	Hm. Mind if I slice you open?
28263	Mr. Peele	DAAAAAHH!
28264	Turk	AAAAAHHH! Uncool!
28265	Carla	OK, listen up everyone! I'm sure you all got the flyer I made reminding everyone of the annual staff picture. I need to know by a show of hands how many of you aren't gonna be able to make it.
28266	Carla	Oh, come on! Aren't you guys embarrassed by our last three staff pictures?
28267	Carla	Laverne. I'm gonna need a little bit of your church enthusiasm to help sell this.
28268	Carla	Dammit, everyone, we are a family.
28269	Laverne	A family, people!
28270	Carla	And I know we love each other.
28271	Laverne	Love is all we got!
28272	Carla	So can't we just take ten minutes from our day to take a real staff photo?
28273	Laverne	Yes, we can! Yes, we can!
28274	Carla	Tambourine's a little much, Laverne.
28275	Elliot	Carla, I don't photograph well. On my driver's license I look like Gary Busey.
28276	Gary Busey	They say the same thing about me. Ha.
28277	Turk	See you later, Elliot.
28278	Dr. Cox	I am gonna let big Bob here give the first excuse.
28279	Dr. Kelso	Blah, blah, blah, I'm not doing it.
28280	Dr. Cox	I'm caught on his collar!
28281	Carla	This picture is happening!
28282	Janitor	No it's not.
28283	Carla	Oh, what do you know, mop jock?
28284	Janitor	I've predicted a couple of things over the years. The kitchen fire of '97, the kitchen fire of '98, the arson conviction of Luis the fry cook, and of course, the eventual termination of the hospital's Convicts to Cooks program. Bottom line? Not gonna happen.
28285	Turk	Not gonna happen! No, not gonna happen, ha, ha! Not gonna hap
28286	Turk	By the way, uh, I won't be at the picture either.
28287	Carla	You'll be there. You'll all be there.
28288	J.D.	Hellooo! If you're wondering what a thank-you-for-being-my-doctor card from Mrs. Wilk looks like, it looks a little something like this.
28289	Dr. Cox	"Happy Anniversary, gals?"
28290	J.D.	Oops. This one's actually from my Aunt Judy and her lady friends. Must have grabbed the wrong card.
28291	Dr. Cox	Uhh, Newbie...
28292	J.D.	Oh, right, your imaginary warning light. Don't be mad, Perry, this day was bound to come. See, I've studied you. I've taken your best qualities and my best qualities and I've combined them into something even better. Much the way that iced tea and lemonade were joined to become an Arnold Palmer. Incidentally, has anyone ever done less to become famous? I mean, yea for me, I mixed two drinks together.
28293	Dr. Cox	Arnold Palmer is a golfer.
28294	J.D.	I'm sure he has lots of hobbies, Perry. The man's a drink mogul.
28295	J.D.'s Narration	In a hospital, even the best of moods can be ruined by somebody handing you a chart.
28296	J.D.	Do you have any family, Mrs. Wilk?
28297	Mrs. Wilk	No. I was married twice. Divorced one, the other one died. Wrong one died.
28298	J.D.	Look, Mrs. Wilk, you have something called systemic amyloidosis. Now, it's in your liver now, but eventually it will shut down all your organs. There's a treatment, but it's very invasive, and at best, it'll just give you a little more time.
28299	Mrs. Wilk	Well, I've had a great life son.
28300	J.D.	Say no more. I'm gonna take amazing care of you.
28301	Mrs. Wilk	OK.
28302	Turk	How's it going today, buddy?
28303	J.D.	Pretty crappy. I just had to tell an old lady she's dying. How about you?
28304	Turk	OK. Elliot turfed this chronic pain patient to me. I have no idea what's wrong with him, so I have to do exploratory surgery.
28305	J.D.'s Thoughts	I always wondered what exploratory surgery was like.
28306	Turk	I've made the first incision. I'm going in.
28307	Turk	Nurse! Hat!
28308	Turk	Colon. Why did it have to be the colon?
28309	Turk	Removing the golden tumor.
28310	Turk	Ladies...
28311	Turk	They knew the risks.
28312	J.D.	Watch out for colon darts.
28313	Turk	Where's the doughnut truck? I got paged there was a doughnut truck out here!
28314	Elliot	I got paged there was a handbag sample sale!
28315	Todd	Where's the boobie-touching booth?
28316	J.D.	It's weird, it's like everyone was lured out here by the thing they want most in the world.
28317	Dr. Cox	Hey! You're not getting your ass kicked!
28318	Dr. Kelso	Hold the phone! Look! Bleachers! Ladder! Bucket of combs! She's trying to take the picture! Scatter!
28319	Carla	Nobody move! Laverne, door!
28320	Laverne	Nobody's gettin' past here, baby!
28321	Carla	OK, everybody, one, two...
28322	Janitor	...and, three.
28323	J.D.	What are you doing here?
28324	Dr. Cox	Mrs. Wilk was asking me some questions that I actually thought would be best answered by you.
28325	Mrs. Wilk	Why did that sweaty attorney ask me if my affairs were in order?
28326	J.D.	Because I want to make sure you're as comfortable as possible.'
28327	Mrs. Wilk	As comfortable as possible? For what?
28328	Dr. Cox	I'm going to sit for this.
28329	J.D.	For the place that you're going. You know, the big, puffy, clouds? The bright lights? All your old friends?
28330	Mrs. Wilk	Seattle?
28331	J.D.	No, no, no, not not Seattle. The you know, the dying peacefully place.
28332	Mrs. Wilk	What are you talking about?
28333	Dr. Cox	Now, I'm going to stand.
28334	J.D.	This morning you told me you'd had a great life.
28335	Mrs. Wilk	Exactly, and I'd like to continue it.
28336	J.D.	Oh, this is just a misunderstanding, I'm so sorry. Tell it was a misunderstanding, that...
28337	Dr. Cox	He's tried to kill before.
28338	J.D's Narration	In a hospital, the words "I'm sorry" can mean a lot of different things.
28339	Turk	So, the surgery went fine. Unfortunately, I didn't find any medical reason for you pain.
28340	J.D's Narration	It can mean "I'm giving up on you."
28341	Turk	I'm sorry.
28342	J.D.'s Narration	It can mean you're not sorry at all.
28343	Janitor	Sorry your picture didn't turn out.
28344	Carla	Yeah.
28345	J.D.'s Narration	And sometimes "I'm sorry" can mean your services are no longer needed.
28346	Mrs. Wilk	I'm sorry, Dr. Dorian.
28347	Dr. Cox	So, you gave her the old death sentence, did you? In the business, we call that a rookie mistake. Thanks for playing.
28348	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
28349	Open	ICU Nurse's Station. Dr. Kelso looks at a basket of fruit with bite marks in each piece.
28350	Dr. Kelso	Who the hell is responsible for this?
28351	J.D.'s Narration	Unfortunately, not even my mouthful of apple-pear-orange-banana-cherry-berry could lift my depression about losing my patient to Dr. Cox.
28352	Dr. Cox	Hand over your stethoscope.
28353	J.D.	What?
28354	Dr. Cox	In victory, I get your stethoscope. It's a trophy. You're lucky we're not back in olden times. I'd have made a necklace out of your teeth.
28355	J.D.	I find this highly unprofessional.
28356	Dr. Cox	Now I'm going to check on Mr. Jenkins, your war hero. I feel he, too, deserves a competent doctor. In fact, I'm gonna take all of your patients, and consequently, your only reason for getting out of that lacy, over-pillowed, four poster virgin cocoon you call a bed every morning.
28357	J.D.	I gotta get Mrs. Wilk back.
28358	J.D.	When did we have a shade remote? I didn't know we had shade remotes.
28359	Janitor	Aww, either your picture didn't come out, or we got a hospital full of vampire doctors.
28360	J.D.'s Thoughts	Vampire doctors? How did he hear about my screenplay?
28361	Carla	I don't know why you did it, but I know it was you.
28362	Janitor	How?
28363	Carla	Because it's always you.
28364	Janitor	It's not always me.
28365	Dr. Kelso	GAAAAH-AAAH-AAAH!!!
28366	Dr. Kelso	Who the hell put tiny wheels on my shoes?!
28367	Janitor	Well, that's his fault. He took a nap in the lounge.
28368	Carla	Why would you ruin this for me? I mean, I didn't even ask you to be there.
28369	Janitor	Imagine that. I've been working here for thirteen years and I guess I don't rate as part of the family.
28370	Carla	Did you want to be in the picture?
28371	Janitor	No! It's just uh...wh...uh..it's ah...I gotta go.
28372	Dr. Kelso	I actually love these.
28373	J.D.	Ms. Brooks, your blood work looks fine. But I'd like to take one more sample. Just for me.
28374	J.D.	You know, you taste a little anemic. Get that down to the lab, buddy.
28375	Keith	Right away, Dr. Acula.
28376	J.D.	That's what they call me. How you doing?
28377	J.D.	The end.
28378	Turk	So Dr. Acula is a doctor *and* a vampire?
28379	J.D.	He's both. And at the very end, I'm gonna put "Dr. Acula" across the screen, take that period, get it out of there. Squish it together, it'll say "Dracula"
28380	Turk	That is an awesome ending!
28381	J.D.	Um, thank you for telling me what I already know, Turk.
28382	Elliot	Frick, it's Mrs. Peele! And one of us has to talk to her.
28383	Turk	All right, the first one to chug their slushy is off the hook. Come on, here we go!
28384	Turk	GAAAAAHHHHH!! AAAAAAAHHHH!! OHH! Brainfreeze!
28385	Mrs. Peele	Why is my husband being discharged?
28386	Elliot	Look, Mrs. Peele, we really cannot jus
28387	Turk	YAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH! AAAAHHAHHAHHH!! It's so cold!
28388	Elliot	Mrs. Peele, even though Dr. Turk is currently incapacitated by his cherry-flavored beverage, he is a fantastic surgeon.
28389	Turk	Yuh-huh.
28390	Elliot	And he didn't find anything. And I am a great doctor...
28391	Turk	Ehh...
28392	Elliot	...and I didn't either. Don't you think that maybe the pain could all be in his head?
28393	Mrs. Peele	Last week, we were all watching TV and he was in too much pain to get up and use the bathroom. So he soiled himself. On the couch, right in front of our son. How do you explain that?
28394	Turk	Maybe there was a really good game on television.
28395	Elliot	Probably not.
28396	J.D.	AHH! My screenplay!
28397	Dr. Kelso	Hey, sport!
28398	J.D.	You just lit your pipe on my title page.
28399	Dr. Kelso	I heard Mrs. Wilk gave you the axe.
28400	J.D.	She said "I've lead a great life." And every doctor in the world knows that's code for "I'm ready to die."
28401	Dr. Kelso	How old do you think I am, Dorian?
28402	J.D.'s Thoughts	OK, there's no way to answer that and not get in trouble. Change the subject.
28403	J.D.	Sir, I would be honored if you and Enid would join me at my place on Sunday for some homemade jambalaya.
28404	Dr. Kelso	Well, it would be good for Enid to get out of the house.
28405	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh my God, he's actually thinking about it. Change the subject back!
28406	J.D.	You're seventy-eight, sir.
28407	Dr. Kelso	You think I'm that old?
28408	J.D.	Jambalaya.
28409	Dr. Kelso	I'm fifty-seven, numb nuts.
28410	J.D.	Really.
28411	Dr. Kelso	I know they say fifty-seven is the new forty.
28412	J.D.	Who?
28413	Dr. Kelso	But lately it seems all people see when they look in my direction is some old guy. Hell, just last week I was in the mall hanging out in Brookstone's and some kid asked me if I was lost.
28414	J.D.	Brookstone? Were you looking for gadgets, sir?
28415	Dr. Kelso	If that's what you trolling for mall ass, then yeah.
28416	J.D.	Oh.
28417	Dr. Kelso	The point is, you think Mrs. Wilk is old enough to die. I'm betting she doesn't agree.
28418	Carla	How am I supposed to know the Janitor has feelings?
28419	Elliot	I should have just believed Mr. Peele. I mean it's not like somebody poos their pants for no reason.
28420	J.D.	Turk did that in college on a bet.
28421	Turk	Carla did not know that story. Thank you.
28422	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes when you're feeling guilty, it's like a storm cloud over your head.
28423	J.D.	I knew there was only one way to make the guilt storm go away.
28424	J.D.	Mrs. Wilk, I'm sorry.
28425	J.D.	Mrs. Wilk, I just wanted to say I was wrong to think that you wouldn't want to try every possible treatment there is, to avoid, you know, the place. You know, there's clouds and...Space Needle...Seattle.
28426	Mrs. Wilk	Yes, you were. Thank you.
28427	J.D.	You're welcome. You got a lot of pluck for an older gal.
28428	Mrs. Wilk	How old do you think I am?
28429	J.D.	Jambalaya!
28430	J.D.'s Narration	There are a lot of ways to make amends.
28431	J.D.'s Narration	It can be as simple as including someone...
28432	Carla	Hey. I want you to be in the picture.
28433	Carla	I thought you were trying to kill me.
28434	Janitor	I fought the urge.
28435	Carla	OK.
28436	Janitor	Thanks.
28437	J.D.'s Narration	...Or as complicated as committing to a difficult journey.
28438	Turk	Mr. Peele, we believe your pain is real.
28439	Elliot	And you're not going anywhere until we figure it out.
28440	Mrs. Peele	Thank you.
28441	J.D.'s Narration	The important thing is to regain the respect of your peers.
28442	Dr. Cox	Say, Newbie. I uh, I gotta hand it to you. It took the heart of a lion to apologize to Mrs. Wilk like that.
28443	J.D.	Thank you.
28444	Dr. Cox	Of course it took the incompetence of a bewildered jackass to make that error to begin with. Never make assumptions based on your own perceptions. Just never do it.
28445	J.D.	Really? You've been spending a lot of time treating my guy, Mr. Jenkins, right?
28446	Dr. Cox	Yeah, he's a Vietnam veteran. He deserves as much.
28447	J.D.	Yeah, actually he's just a homeless guy. I made up the war veteran story to motivate my boys. But, what are you gonna do?
28448	J.D.	Oh, come on, you've gotten me like a hundred times. I finally got you once. It was bound to happen, right?
28449	Dr. Cox	I see your point. Kindly blow it out your ass.
28450	Carla	How did you get all these people to come out here?
28451	Janitor	Fear.
28452	Carla	OK, everybody, one, two, three!
28453	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
28454	Open	Elliot's apartment - bathroom. Camera pans around to show the various items in the room. Music plays over iPod speakers.
28455	J.D.'s Narration	Living with Elliot was certainly different. Every inch of her apartment was filled with girly stuff. There were lavender-scented candles, pink robes, bath salts. It. Was. Awesome.
28456	J.D.'s Narration	My first day off in weeks. Only one thing could make it better: Cranking up the Toto.
28457	J.D.	Mango body butter?
28458	J.D.'s Narration	Even though it sucks being paged to the hospital by an intern, there's nothing I like more than riding my scooter, Sasha, through puddles after a rain.
28459	J.D.'s Thoughts	Here comes a big 'un!
28460	J.D.	Where was I?
28461	J.D.	You're not aware of any sort of odd, underground canal system beneath the hospital, are you? I think I saw a manatee.
28462	Janitor	Was his name Julian?
28463	J.D.	We didn't exchange pleasantries.
28464	Janitor	That's Julian. Watch it, wet paint. Kelso's starting a new line system to help people get around. Green's gonna go to the smoker's lounge, blue to the ICU, and yellow to all the exits.
28465	J.D.	What's red for?
28466	Janitor	Sneaker painting.
28467	J.D.	OK, I'm here. What's the emergency Keith?
28468	Keith	Uh, do you want Mr. Fleming on unfractionated or low molecular weight Heparin?
28469	J.D.	They're the exact same thing. Every doctor here knows that. Why would you page me?
28470	Dr. Cox	Because I told him to, and I know what you're thinking, Dorothy. Why would I have one of your interns call you in on one of your precious days off for something so gosh-darn trivial? Well, the real question ought to be: Why, when you were an intern, did you call me in time after time after time after time? So now, to commemorate the first of many unnecessary disruptions of your life, I've invited Laverne's church choir here to summarize my feelings in exuberant song.
28471	Choir	Payback is a bitch!
28472	Laverne	Mmhmm!
28473	Choir	Payback is a bitch!
28474	Laverne	Oh yeah!
28475	Choir	Payback is a bitch!
28476	Laverne	Mmhmm!
28477	Choir	Payback is a bitch! Ohhh, Ooohh!
28478	Laverne	It's just the beginning!
28479	Choir	Ooohh!
28480	Laverne	But it's payback! Ohh, It's payback! Ohhh,
28481	Choir	Payback is a bitch!
28482	Laverne	Payback!
28483	Choir	Payback is a bitch!
28484	Laverne	Payback!
28485	Choir	Payback is a bitch!
28486	Laverne	Oh, Lord!
28487	Choir	Payback is a bitch!
28488	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
28489	Open	Admissions Area. J.D. is attempting to sneak out.
28490	J.D.'s Thoughts	I gotta get back home before anyone asks me to do stuff. Fat guy! Go! Go! Go! Move out! Move out!
28491	J.D.'s Thoughts	Thank you, fast food industry.
28492	Dr. Kelso	Dorian, I need you to do the residents' call schedule for next month.
28493	J.D.	Sir, I'm not even supposed to be here.
28494	Dr. Kelso	Ahh, me neither, son. I was one of the most promising shortstops to come out of Altoona, Pennsylvania. Then came the Dominicans. Long story short, calling them all "Pepe" was just racist enough to get me a lifelong ban from the Appalachian Rookie League. Have the schedules on my desk by lunch.
28495	Carla	That's gonna be us someday.
28496	Turk	How does that not make you nervous? I mean what if our kid is out of control? Like, I was watching Webster last night, right? And Webster got all into the pancake mix. And baby, I mean all into the pancake mix.
28497	Carla	Oh, Turk, that's a stupid sitcom.
28498	Carla	I mean, that's a sitcom.
28499	Turk	What if the second our baby's born I start screwing things up?
28500	Turk	Oh, my God, hey, little doll! Oh, God, I can't believe it!
28501	Jordan	OK, either the heat in my office is broken, or I drifted off and fantasized about Rudy Giuliani again.
28502	Turk	Ha ha! He's not even sexy! Right, baby?
28503	Carla	Ahh, Rudy, don't stop...
28504	Turk	Baby!
28505	Carla	Huh?
28506	Jordan	Relax! She's only fantasizing because you don't satisfy her. Any-who, can someone take Jack for a minute?
28507	Carla	No problem!
28508	Jordan	Thank you.
28509	Carla	See, Turk? I'm great with kids. And I promise you don't even have to check in as a parent until you have to teach our son about sports.
28510	Turk	And satisfying women. 'Cause I know how to satisfy a woman, right baby?
28511	Carla	I'm sure you can.
28512	Turk	That's what I'm talking about.
28513	J.D.	Done, and I am outta here.
28514	J.D.	Dammit!
28515	J.D.	Keith, you've got to stop paging me for totally unimportant things!
28516	J.D.	Ohhh! That man's chest cavity is completely open. I can see his heart beating.
28517	Keith	He sneezed and all his surgical staples popped out!
28518	J.D.	Good page, good page!
28519	Elliot	OK, rock-tors. That's my name for doctors who rock. Next patient.
28520	J.D.'s Narration	Ever since her fellowship, Elliot loved that her interns saw her as an endocrinology expert.
28521	Intern #1	Doctor Reid, why would Mr. Brown develop new onset diabetes and high blood pressure simultaneously?
28522	Elliot	Well, as an endocrinology expert, eh-heh, in my expert opinion both can be expertly explained by a pituitary adenoma causing Cushing's syndrome.
28523	Dr. Cox	Hate to burst your bubble there, Barbie, but your endocrinology fellowship lasted all of five days. Granted, to you, five days may seem like an eternity seeing as it's roughly five times as long as any of your white, pasty relationships have lasted, but trust me. That hardly makes you an expert.
28524	Elliot	Oh, really? Well you never went to assface school, but you seem to be an expert at that. Am I right?
28525	J.D.	Here's some!
28526	Dr. Cox	You're going to high-five that? Bi-hig mistake.
28527	J.D.	I didn't know what I was high-fiving, I gotta stop doing that.
28528	Elliot	Did you eat my mango body butter?
28529	J.D.	No.
28530	J.D.'s Thoughts	I shmeared it on a bagel.
28531	Turk	Dr. Kelso! 'Sup? Look, I just heard that we're doing our first ever in-house heart transplant. Now, I know, you'll be objective in choosing which surgical resident gets to assist. But, I also thought you might enjoy this commemorative Dr. Kelso bobblehead. Huh?
28532	Dr. Kelso	Oh, bobbleheads. You always think you're going to get bored with it, but you never do.
28533	Dr. Kelso	Bobbly, bobbly, bobbly, bobbly, bobbly, bobbly, bobbly, bobbly, bobbly, bobbly...
28534	Turk	Sir?
28535	Dr. Kelso	Eh..oh..Turkleton, you're still here? Did you honestly think you'd be the only surgeon to walk in here trying to bribe me?
28536	Todd	Inflatable five!
28537	Dr. Kelso	None of you will be assisting on anything because we still don't have a donor heart. Last night, Mr. Bolger here was declared brain dead. We have to convince his family to pull the plug and give us his heart. Whichever one of you Beni-Hana rejects pulls this off gets the operation.
28538	Dr. Kelso	Go!
28539	Ted	My band has decided we're only singing songs from classic movies now.
28540	J.D.	Ted, I'm a little busy, OK? Toodles.
28541	Intern #2	Dr. Reid, what are the possible cardiac complications to thyrotoxicosis?
28542	Elliot	Ah. Mmm. Hold on, I just have to blow my nose.
28543	J.D.'s Narration	Even though I was happy for Elliot, the endocrinology expert, I still couldn't figure out how she knew so damn much.
28544	Worthless Peons	Just a still town girl on a Saturday night / Looking for the fight of her life...
28545	Elliot	Uh, to answer your question, thyrotoxicosis can manifest with incessant tachycardia leading to cardiomyopathy.
28546	Worthless Peons	...Locking rhythms to the beat of her heart, changing woman into life...
28547	Dr. Cox	Therefore, Mr. Langley's pancreatitis is most likely secondary to gallstones.
28548	Elliot	Wrong-o, Perry. Mr. Langley's pancreatitis is most likely due to to Type 1 familial hyper-lipoproteinemia as demonstrated by the eruptive xanthomas on the Achilles tendon.
28549	Interns	Ooohh!
28550	Dr. Cox	Interns, flee, now!
28551	Dr. Cox	Now there is just no way you could have known that off the top of that straw-colored scarecrow head of yours.
28552	Elliot	Uh, hold on. I need to take a quick mental picture of your total humiliation.
28553	Elliot	Kk-kk. Got it.
28554	Dr. Cox	There are actually many things in life that I've yet to figure out. Like, why men wear cell phones on their belt when they could so easily fit them in their pocket, mere millimeters away. Or why, and I'm not complaining, women wear tube tops, even though every ten seconds it makes them do this.
28555	Dr. Cox	"Get back in there!" But, of all my endless queries, the one thing I damn sure will figure out and soon is how you keep coming up with all these fancy-pants answers. It is, for all intents and purposes, like they're falling from the sky.
28556	Carla	Excuse me, can anyone else watch this kid for a second?
28557	Turk	She'll be all right. I wonder what's taking Jordan so long.
28558	Jordan	Oh, my God, it's like a hundred and thirty degrees in here.
28559	Jordan	I have got to get out of here!
28560	Jordan	Mmm. I think the silicone in my lips is expanding. Ohh.
28561	Turk	I mean, I've got to talk to the Bolger family about getting their son's heart but I can't find them anywhere.
28562	Laverne	Oh, they're in the doctor's lounge.
28563	Turk	Oh, my God, Laverne, I love you. Listen if any other surgeon asks about them, you send them someplace else. The cafeteria, the zoo, I don't care. I'm going to get my heart!
28564	Mr. Bolger	We're just not sure, Dr. Turk.
28565	J.D.'s Narration	When a career opportunity is slipping through their fingers, even a doctor can succumb to one of the basest human impulses.
28566	Turk	You know, I've donated an organ.
28567	J.D.'s Narration	They can lie.
28568	Turk	See, my buddy, he was sick, and so I gave him one of my kidneys.
28569	Mr. Bolger	But my son only has one heart.
28570	Turk	But, uh, a short time after that I donated my other kidney.
28571	Mr. Bolger	We're going to check on our son.
28572	J.D.'s Thoughts	OK, the coast is clear. Just a few more steps and you're out of here.
28573	Carla	J.D.! I need to talk to someone. Here. Take him.
28574	Janitor	What?
28575	Carla	Yep.
28576	Carla	Come on.
28577	Janitor	Hey, wait. No!
28578	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Reid, our hospital lecture series is tonight and our psychologist, Dr. Burke, had to cancel his talk on fear of public speaking.
28579	Elliot	Why, because he's afraid of speaking in public?
28580	Dr. Kelso	No, his depression finally got the best of him and he hung himself.
28581	Dr. Kelso	Any-who, we need a substitute speaker and Dr. Cox suggested you'd be the perfect person for an intensive Q-and-A on endocrinology. Be in the classroom at six.
28582	Dr. Cox	And Barbie, say, if it's cold in there you can just borrow my lab coat. It's super warm because I lined it with these. Ta-da!
28583	Carla	J.D., I have to admit this to somebody. I don't like kids!
28584	J.D.	What are you talking about? You're the most maternal person I know.
28585	Carla	I'm a nurse, J.D., I'm trained to fake it. I just don't understand whats so adorable in "Yay, you made a poopie in the potty!" I'm supposed to be impressed? There's a monkey at the zoo who can do that. I mean, you know, when he's not playing with himself.
28586	J.D.	Well, if you don't want a baby, Carla, don't have a baby.
28587	Carla	But J.D., I want to have a child with Turk more than anything in the world. I know, it's crazy, but I'm a girl and that's how we roll. What are we gonna do? I'm supposed to be the brave one.
28588	Turk	Dude, you gotta help me out.
28589	J.D.'s Narration	A hospital can sometimes feel like a magical place, where people's hopes and dreams are often far from ordinary.
28590	J.D.	Whether they're looking for brains, a heart, or courage. As for me, I was just gonna keep on following that yellow line and hope I'd eventually get back home.
28591	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
28592	Open	ICU.
28593	Laverne	So how was the zoo?
28594	Todd	It was awesome. They had lions and tigers and bears...
28595	Todd	...Oh my. Hey there.
28596	Turk	Dude, it was awful. I couldn't stop lying to them. I only have two moves. If surgery goes well, the fake-modest nod and wink. Now, if surgery goes bad and the guy dies, there's always the head-shake-sad-walkaway.
28597	J.D.	Turk, Toto and I are going home.
28598	Turk	Fine!
28599	J.D.	OK, I'll help.
28600	Turk	Thank you! Now how do I tell those people to let their so go?
28601	J.D.	Just try to imagine what they're going through. I mean sometimes I think about what it's gonna be like when you die.
28602	Turk	Because you think I'm going first because of my diabetes.
28603	J.D.	Right, and where do we meet up in heaven?
28604	Turk	At the milkshake pool on the lesbian cloud.
28605	J.D.	I'll see you there, player! I love religion. The point is, Turk, if someone tried to pull the plug on you without being totally honest with you, you know where they'd end up?
28606	Turk	In hell, watching The View.
28607	J.D.	Next to the super-high, unreachable cupcake table.
28608	J.D.'s Narration	After trying to get out of the hospital vertically, I decided to go the horizontal route: hiding in a body bag.
28609	J.D.	Can you press "lobby," please?
28610	Doug	GYAAAAAHHHH-DAH!!!
28611	J.D.	OWW!! OWW!! OWW!!! DOUG! Why are you hitting me?!?
28612	Doug	Because I thought you were a dead guy coming back to life!
28613	J.D.	Then why were you hitting me?!
28614	Elliot	There, you are. Come on.
28615	J.D.	No, no! Elliot, I'm not even supposed to be here, I'm going home!
28616	Dr. Cox	So, if I understand correctly, you left my only child with a creepy, borderline psychotic who hates everyone?
28617	Carla	How is that different from leaving him with you?
28618	Dr. Cox	I have freckles.
28619	Janitor	Oil can. Oil can!
28620	Janitor	Thank you.
28621	Dr. Cox	Hey, you. Where's my son?
28622	Janitor	Oh, he's playing with the birds out on the ledge.
28623	Carla	What?!
28624	Janitor	I'm kidding, come on. He's green!
28625	Dr. Cox	Aww, come on.
28626	Janitor	Yeah, the little nipper got hold of a paint gun when I was painting this green line down to the smoker's lounge. Thanks to him, I only got halfway down.
28627	Dr. Kelso	You look familiar. You ever play ball in Pennsylvania? Pepe?
28628	Turk	Mr. Bolger, look, before you throw me out of here, I just want to apologize about earlier. Um, I don't know what I was thinking, but rest assured, from here on out whatever you ask me, I will be completely honest with you.
28629	Mr. Bolger	Do you shave your head because you like the way it looks or because you're going bald?
28630	Turk	Bald.
28631	Mr. Bolger	OK, next question.
28632	Turk	With all those topical treatments, let's just say I wasn't completely functional.
28633	Mr. Bolger	Why are all the surgical residents being so relentless about my son's heart?
28634	Turk	Because whichever one of us convinces you to pull the plug and donate his heart gets to assist in the transplant.
28635	Mr. Bolger	You're talking about my son here. And you don't even know him.
28636	Turk	What's his name?
28637	Mr. Bolger	Ray.
28638	Turk	How you doin', Ray? Now ask me if I think it's the right thing to do, even if you request that I don't assist.
28639	Mr. Bolger	Do you?
28640	Turk	Yes. I'm really sorry.
28641	Elliot	J.D., there is just no way that I'm going to be able to pull this off. In a few hours, I'm going to have a room full of specialists firing questions at me. I gonna be a bigger fraud than Barry Bonds!
28642	J.D.'s Thoughts	OK, you knew he's an athlete of some kind. Just say something general.
28643	J.D.	Still, I love it when Bonds wins at the game that he plays. Look, Elliot, you know how people become specialists? They obsess about the material over and over again until it becomes lodged into their brains. That's exactly what you've been doing. Watch, where's the closest page you've hidden around here?
28644	Elliot	Hmm.
28645	J.D.	Wha-? You are good.
28646	Elliot	Hmm.
28647	J.D.	All right look. What's the leading differential in an obese woman suffering from amenorrhea and hirsutism?
28648	Elliot	Polycystic ovaries. Oh my God, I knew it! Ha! Up here!
28649	Carla	Dr. Cox?
28650	Dr. Cox	Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.
28651	Carla	Why aren't you freaking out? Look at him, your kid's, like, all green and slimy.
28652	Dr. Cox	I suppose it's because when Jordan was pregnant, I mentally prepared myself for her giving birth to something green and slimy.
28653	Carla	Where is Jordan, anyway?
28654	Dr. Cox	The wicked witch of the east wing?
28655	Jordan	Help! I'm melting in here! Anyone, help! I'm melting!
28656	Dr. Cox	So, he's green. Don't beat yourself up, Carla. Come on, so far on my watch, he's gotten stitches, cut his own hair and eaten over four dollars in change. Honestly, if I ever need to feed the parking meter, I just check the diaper, don't I?
28657	Carla	You don't understand. I didn't dump him on the Janitor because I was busy. I dumped him on him because he was working my last nerve and I wanted to smoosh his face. I'm not meant for this.
28658	Dr. Cox	Carla, look at me and Jordan. You know how we hate everyone?
28659	Carla	Yeah.
28660	Dr. Cox	Well, that goes doubly for children. It's true. They're loud, you can't understand them, they're like tiny cab drivers. But, trust me, when you do have your own kid, you won't feel that way.
28661	Carla	Yeah, what what will be different?
28662	Dr. Cox	He'll be yours.
28663	Turk	Sir, I was watching that.
28664	Dr. Kelso	Well, why don't I just tell you what happened? Uncle Phillip gets Webster the dog despite George and Ma'am's objections. It was a good one. Now, on your feet. They need you in the OR to assist on the heart transplant.
28665	Turk	The Bolgers said yes?
28666	Dr. Kelso	Mr. Bolger wanted you to have this.
28667	Turk	His son's driver's license?
28668	Dr. Kelso	Turn it over.
28669	J.D.'s Narration	Every so often, a wizard comes along and tells you exactly what you need to hear.
28670	Dr. Kelso	Seems like you had a heart all along.
28671	Elliot	Superior vena cava?
28672	J.D.	That's right! See? You had the brains all along.
28673	Dr. Cox	Trust me, Carla. When you do have your own kid, you're gonna find that you had the courage to be a parent all along.
28674	Carla	Thank you.
28675	Ted	Somewhere, over the rainbow, way up high, there's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby...
28676	Ted	...Someday I'll wish upon a star, wake up where the clouds are so far behind me...
28677	Ted	...Where troubles melt like lemon drops, high above the chimney tops. That's where you'll find me, somewhere over the rainbow. Blue birds fly over the rainbow....
28678	Ted	...why, then, oh why can't I?
28679	Dr. Cox	Hey, Dorothy. Going home, are you?
28680	J.D.	Yep!
28681	Ted	If happy little blue birds fly beyond the rainbow, why, oh why can't I?
28682	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
28683	Open	Convenience store parking lot. J.D. enters on his scooter.
28684	J.D.'s Narration	I was super-psyched to get my scooter, Sasha, back from the shop, but my new scooter insurance hadn't kicked in yet, so I was being extra-cautious.
28685	J.D.	Perfect. Time for my morning slushie.
28686	Officer	Get out of the way! The store's being robbed!
28687	Officer	Freeze!
28688	J.D.	The wall! Hide behind the wall!
28689	J.D.	NO! Sasha!
28690	Robber	All right! All right! OK.
28691	J.D.	There was a wall! What's the matter with you?
28692	J.D.	Who is still shooting? She's down!
28693	J.D.	It's over!
28694	Patient	Is this gonna hurt?
28695	J.D.	Oh, don't be such a baby, it's a magnetic image. I apologize, Mr. Foster, I'm a little upset. My scooter, Sasha was assassinated this morning.
28696	Turk	Yeah, he was so attached to that thing. He used to wear a bracelet that said "Sasha Forever."
28697	J.D.	Oh come on, Turk, it was just a joke. And I only wore it for one week.
28698	Turk	Whatever.
28699	J.D.	Now let's fire this baby up.
28700	J.D.	OK, so I still wear the bracelet.
28701	Turk	Idiot. OH!
28702	Turk	My watch.
28703	Ted	HEY, CARLA!
28704	Carla	Earphones, Ted!
28705	Ted	Sorry. Hey, Carla, did you hear that the lottery's up to a hundred million? If I win that baby, it's separate beds for me and my mom.
28706	Carla	Yeah, and you can spend the other 99,999,000 on therapy.
28707	Ted	What would you do with the money?
28708	Elliot	Carla, I can't believe you're going to be a mom!
28709	Carla	I know! It was expensive, but totally worth it.
28710	Carla	Right, baby?
28711	Turk	Stupid lotto.
28712	Carla	Good morning, Mrs. Wilk.
28713	Mrs. Wilk	Great morning.
28714	Carla	Whoa.
28715	Mrs. Wilk	That is wrong.
28716	Carla	Care to join me in a super loud throat clear?
28717	Mrs. Wilk	Absolutely.
28718	Carla	One, two, three.
28719	Carla & Mrs. Wilk	AHEM!
28720	Carla	Elliot, I can't believe you would do that.
28721	Turk	What did you do?
28722	J.D.	Was it naughty?
28723	J.D.'s Narration	When women want men to completely zone out, there's always one thing they can talk about.
28724	Elliot	You see, uh, yesterday I went shoe shopping and there was this one pair of...
28725	Turk and J.D.'s Thoughts	Shoe shopping.
28726	Elliot	...and they were cute.
28727	Carla	Great, we can talk. What were you thinking?
28728	Elliot	So, we kissed? I've been treating his kid for a week and we just really hit it off, you know? I mean it started off with some pretty innocent flirting, "Hi, I'm Dr. Reid," "Why is there blood in my son's stool?"
28729	J.D.	Huh?
28730	Turk	Whose stool?
28731	Carla	Strappy sandals.
28732	Turk and J.D.'s Thoughts	Shoe shopping.
28733	Carla	Continue.
28734	Elliot's Voiceover	And then I asked where his wife was. He said "she's not with us."
28735	Elliot	And then, you know...bleeeh.
28736	Carla	Cool. Oh, I almost forgot. Lace bra.
28737	J.D.	Were they D's?
28738	Turk	Be specific.
28739	J.D.	Good news, Mr. Foster. The radiologist said your scan is completely clear, but we'd like to keep you here for a few more tests.
28740	Mr. Foster	Whatever you say, doc.
28741	J.D.'s Narration	A lot of weird things can happen in a hospital. Like Doug not getting a dead body out of his bed before rigor mortis sets in.
28742	Doug	Ted, give me a hand. He's not gonna fit in the body bag like this so, uh, lie across his feet and I'm gonna push down his head and straighten him out.
28743	Ted	Fun.
28744	Doug	One, two, three!
28745	Ted	Waaahh! Ooof!
28746	Doug	Ted?
28747	J.D.'s Narration	Still, the weirdest thing is when a really cool guy who's fine and talking to you one minute...
28748	J.D.	...is dead the next. Of course, in hospitals this happens a lot, so you have to shake it off and move on. Except when this happens.
28749	Dr. Cox	Well! If it isn't the four horsewomen of the apocalypse. There's a Morbidity and Mortality conference tomorrow morning to figure out who is responsible for Mr. Foster's death and here's the exciting news. I'm pretty sure it was one of you.
28750	J.D.	You really gotta change that cellphone ring.
28751	Turk	Mom, not now.
28752	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
28753	Open	Auditorium full of doctors. Turk, Elliot, Carla and J.D. sit before a panel of senior staffers including Dr. Kelso, Dr. Cox and Ted.
28754	J.D.'s Narration	So, a patient was dead and one of us was going to be blamed.
28755	J.D.	Dude, you've got to change that cell phone ring.
28756	Turk	You think so, huh? Mom, not now.
28757	J.D.'s Narration	With Morbidity and Mortality conferences, the first question sets the tone for the whole day.
28758	Dr. Kelso	Who the hell ate my scone?
28759	Dr. Cox	That would be me, Bobbo, and it was delicious. My compliments to the little lady.
28760	Dr. Kelso	I made those.
28761	Dr. Cox	I know.
28762	Dr. Kelso	Dorian, you admitted Mr. Foster with coughing and shortness of breath. Is that correct?
28763	J.D.	Yes.
28764	J.D.	Mic check, mic check.
28765	J.D.	Yes.
28766	Dr. Kelso	And then what happened?
28767	Dr. Kelso	Dorian. I'm ten feet away from you. Talk.
28768	J.D.	Uh, Mr. Foster had recently flown to India, where had been exposed to an outbreak of pertussis. I was going to check on his labs, but first I had to visit another patient, Mr. Sutton.
28769	J.D.	So, Mr. Sutton, when you came with heartburn, I bet you thought I'd kick your butt right out of here. But not this guy. I admitted you and I stayed up all night studying your EKG because I had a hunch, and no girlfriend. But it was mostly the hunch thing. And that hunch paid off because if I hadn't found that blocked artery, you'd be dead right now.
28770	J.D.'s Thoughts	And here comes the gratitude. The two words every doctor lives to hear.
28771	Mr. Sutton	Later, dude.
28772	J.D.	I can't believe he didn't thank me. You'll thank me when you leave, won't you?
28773	Mr. Foster	I-I don't know. Why are you so needy?
28774	Turk	Dude, he keeps a hug schedule with his friends.
28775	J.D.	Oh, OK, Turk. Looks like someone's getting crossed off their 2:00 spot and getting penciled in for never. How does that feel, does it sting?
28776	J.D.'s Thoughts	He's hurting. Hug him. Hug him now!
28777	Carla	Hey, guys? What would you do with a hundred million dollars?
28778	Dr. Kelso	A hundred million dollars?
28779	Carla	Sir, the super lotto jackpot was up to a hundred million dollars, so earlier that morning...
28780	Carla	I'm just saying, think of what you could do with that kind of money.
28781	Janitor	I could get a trained shark.
28782	Carla	Why?
28783	J.D.	Thanks for inviting me over, Janitor.
28784	Janitor	Anytime, buddy! Anytime. Wait for him, wait for him.
28785	J.D.	Can opener!
28786	Janitor	The lobster's in the pot! Devour! Devour!
28787	J.D.	Something feels pinchy. WHOA! AAH! WAAAH!! AAAAHH!!
28788	Janitor	Save me a leg.
28789	Janitor	I'm in.
28790	Carla	And you know, we could buy a lot more tickets if you could collect money from everyone.
28791	Janitor	I'll start going through their lockers.
28792	Carla	No, I meant asking them.
28793	Janitor	Seems kind of roundabout, but OK.
28794	Carla	Hey, Dr. Cox. You wanna put in for some lottery tickets?
28795	Dr. Cox	Oh, gosh, Carla, I would. I really would, but you see, I already set fire to a big pile of money just this morning.
28796	Carla	Hey, we have the same chance of winning as anyone else.
28797	Dr. Cox	And the category is, ding, things that have a better chance of happening than you winning the lottery: Tedsky, throw ten seconds on the clock for me, would you please?
28798	Ted	Go.
28799	Dr. Cox	Brain transplants, Britney Spears having another hit record, the Rolling Stones going on a farewell tour and actually meaning it, me caring about anything that happens on Wisteria Lane, Jessica Simpson winning an Oscar, Jessica Alba winning an Oscar, Jessica Simpson becoming Jessica Alba-Simpson...
28800	Ted	Time!
28801	Dr. Cox	Ohh..
28802	Carla	Anyway, that explains why I went into the room and said...
28803	Carla	What would you do with a hundred million dollars?
28804	J.D.	Me? Floating-Head Doctor.
28805	Turk	Here we go.
28806	J.D.	Yeah, I'd spend the money researching how to successfully separate my head from my body. That way I could literally be in two places at once.
28807	J.D.'s Head	Looking good, Mr. Henderson. Looking real good, Nurse Meyers.
28808	J.D.'s Head	Uh-oh, he's flat-lining! Body, come!
28809	J.D.'s Head	Dammit! Starting CPR.
28810	J.D.'s Head	Oww!
28811	J.D.	Well, there would probably be some kinks to work out initially.
28812	Woman	Where is that whore?
28813	Dr. Kelso	Who's a whore?
28814	Elliot	That'd be me, sir.
28815	Dr. Kelso	Oh, of course. Would you care to elaborate?
28816	Elliot	See, um, yesterday, uh, I went shoe shopping...
28817	Turk's Thoughts	Shoe shopping.
28818	Ted's Thoughts	Shoe shopping.
28819	Audience's Thoughts	Shoe shopping.
28820	Elliot	...and they had a T-strap.
28821	Dr. Cox	Oh, puh-lease. Jordan used to use that one on me all the time. Immune. Watch this. Satin panties!
28822	Elliot	Fine. I was checking on Mrs. Wilk and...
28823	Elliot	Mrs. Wilk, I just wanted to explain to you my behavior before. It's not like I was just making out with some random guy in the hospital, I wouldn't do that. Well, I did that once, there was this Medevac pilot. Actually, he just turned out to be an orderly who got his hands on a helicopter helmet, but this is different. Sure, it could get complicated, he has a son...
28824	Mrs. Wilk	And a wife.
28825	Elliot	I've been making out with a married man while his sick child slept a few feet away! Oh, my God, I've become my mother.
28826	Elliot	You said your wife was dead!
28827	Man	No, I said she wasn't with us. Don't make me out to be a bad guy.
28828	Elliot	Well, you're not a good guy. Good guys don't lie about being single, or about being helicopter pilots. If you're a good guy, you would get in there and tell her what happened.
28829	Man	You're right.
28830	Elliot	Hell, yeah, I am.
28831	Elliot	Wait, what?!
28832	Elliot's Voiceover	You know how, when something horrible happens like a car accident, everything slows down?
28833	Elliot	Noooooooooo!!!
28834	Wife	WHOOOOORRRE!!
28835	Wife	Where is that whore?
28836	Elliot	Hey, guys. 'Sup?
28837	J.D.	Elliot, would you do me a favor and cover Mr. Foster for me? I have to go to Mr. Sutton's house and get the thank you I deserve.
28838	Carla	You are so obsessing about this.
28839	Turk	It's like the time you were convinced that the cafeteria workers were giving you small waffles. How'd that work out for you?
28840	J.D.	They waffle ironed my foot. But this different, buddy. Look, I need a ride.
28841	Turk	Pass.
28842	J.D.	Oh, pass, huh? Well this is what happened last time you passed.
28843	Elliot	Oh!
28844	Carla	Yi.
28845	J.D.	This is where Sutton lives, right? Let's get in there.
28846	Turk	J.D...
28847	Turk	Dude?
28848	J.D.	OK. Just back away slowly.
28849	J.D.	Oh no, Turk. They're organized!
28850	J.D.	AAAHH!!
28851	Dr. Cox	Good lord, Bobbo, was that your stomach?
28852	J.D.'s Narration	And there it was. Hope. Dr. Kelso's inability to deal with hunger was legendary. We were as good as home.
28853	Dr. Kelso	I've heard enough. Let's call it and go to lunch.
28854	Dr. Cox	Uh, just hold on! That is not the way it works, Bobbo. This is important, dammit. You sit back down and get on with it.
28855	Dr. Kelso	Perry, I'm in charge here.
28856	Dr. Cox	Ted, give him your sandwich.
28857	Ted	I suppose I could spare a small corner.
28858	Dr. Kelso	All right, everyone just stay where you are and we will be back in um, two minutes.
28859	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
28860	Open	Auditorium.
28861	J.D.'s Narration	One sandwich later we got back into it.
28862	Dr. Kelso	And then what happened, Dr. Dorian?
28863	J.D.	Well, sir, fortunately for us ostriches are flightless birds.
28864	J.D.	There goes the sentry. Every three minutes, like clockwork.
28865	Turk	Dude, can I admit something to you? I kind of missed not getting my hug today.
28866	J.D.	Here comes your vanilla bear!
28867	Turk	J.D., J.D., uh, J.D.!
28868	J.D.	Wooohhh!!
28869	Turk	Oh! Dude, don't sweat it. It says here that the ostrich is generally a docile creature.
28870	J.D.	Oh, thank God.
28871	Turk	It also says their kick can kill a man.
28872	J.D.	What?! I'm coming back up!
28873	J.D.	Turk?
28874	J.D.	WAAAAHHH!!
28875	J.D.	Mr. Sutton, I hope this isn't a bad time.
28876	Dr. Kelso	Who cares about Mr. Sutton? So, Dr. Reid, you were covering Mr. Foster.
28877	Elliot	Uh, actually, sir, I was on my way to cover Mr. Foster, but then I stopped in Mrs. Wilk's room, and...
28878	Keith	What are you doing?
28879	Elliot	Don't look at me! Keith, do you see the woman standing outside?
28880	Keith	Yeah, I see her.
28881	Elliot	I made out with her husband this morning!
28882	Keith	That's disgusting.
28883	Elliot	OK, Keith, just get out of here and go do PFT's on Mr. Foster.
28884	Mrs. Wilk	Dr. Reid, why are you hiding? You didn't do anything wrong.
28885	Elliot	If we all win this lottery, then I am using that money to find a decent man.
28886	Priest	You may kiss the bride.
28887	Elliot	Mmm. Mmhmm. Whoa, save it for tonight, big guy.
28888	Groom	Mazel Tov.
28889	Elliot	Ugh, why did I make him Jewish? My parents will kill me.
28890	J.D.	Why ostriches?
28891	Mr. Sutton	They're such majestic creatures, don't you think? And, you know, they're kind of like my children. Plus, I make belts out of their necks.
28892	J.D.	OK look, Mr. Sutton, I'm sure you're wondering why...
28893	Turk	...aaaAAAAHHHHH!!!!
28894	Mr. Sutton	There *is* a door.
28895	J.D.	You OK? Did you try and escape?
28896	Turk	I did escape. There was one waiting in the car.
28897	J.D.	Oh.
28898	Mr. Sutton	That's Leon. Loves car rides. Likes to stick his head out the window and I tell him it's a little too dangerous, but he doesn't listen to me.
28899	J.D.	Mr. Sutton, I cured you and you never thanked me.
28900	Mr. Sutton	Why would I thank you for doing your job? I'm a garbageman. How many times a day do you think I get thanked?
28901	Turk	Six.
28902	Mr. Sutton	You're off by about six.
28903	Turk	Twelve!
28904	Mr. Sutton	I'm starting to see why Leon outfoxed you.
28905	Turk	Stupid bird stole my hat.
28906	J.D.	I just don't see why it's such a big deal for you to say, "hey, doc..." Why did he just walk away like that?
28907	Turk	Uhh..
28908	J.D.	Ruh-roh.
28909	Turk	Don't move.
28910	J.D.	I do admit, he looks pretty phat in your Kango.
28911	Carla	Hey, everybody, they're about to pick the lottery numbers. And remember that when we win, we win as a family.
28912	Janitor	I set aside twenty tickets just for you and I to split.
28913	Carla	Perfect.
28914	Keith	Nurse Espinosa. Mr. Foster's cough is getting worse and Dr. Dorian's gone. Dr. Reid's covering, but she's sort of indisposed.
28915	Carla	Kid, I'm about to become a millionaire. Call Dr. Turk, he's the surgeon on call. You're missing out. I bet there's plenty of things you could do with a hundred million dollars.
28916	Dr. Cox	Aw, come on, you gotta make that shot.
28917	Jordan	Let me out of here! I will kill you!
28918	Dr. Cox	I'm watching the game.
28919	Jordan	Sweetie, you wanna get naughty? Ooh..
28920	Jordan	Oh, yeah.
28921	Jordan	Come on, do it. Do it.
28922	Dr. Cox	Ah, I can wait another day. Button up and watch the game.
28923	Dr. Cox	I gotta call my glass guy.
28924	Elliot	Mrs. Brown, I want you to know how sorry I am for kissing your husband, but we are two women who have both been wronged and both been lied to and the healthiest thing for us to do right now is just to walk away from each other with our dignity intact. Don't you agree?
28925	Mrs. Brown	Do you know what I do with whores? I punch them in the face.
28926	Elliot	Bring it, bitch.
28927	Turk	Dude, are you really gonna sit here all day just to thank your garbageman?
28928	J.D.	Yes! Jabbar'e has been added to the hug schedule. You want to wait with me?
28929	Turk	I can't, I was supposed to be on call five minutes ago.
28930	J.D.'s Narration	This whole experience got me thinking about the nature of gratitude. I guess in the end...
28931	J.D.	...whether you're a doctor or a garbageman...
28932	Dr. Kelso	Dorian. What are you doing?
28933	J.D.	Sorry, sir, uh, um, sometimes I like to just sum things up.
28934	Dr. Kelso	Well, allow me to do that for you. In the end, when Mr. Foster started coughing up blood...
28935	Dr. Kelso's Voiceover	...the on-call surgeon was stuck in traffic...
28936	Dr. Kelso's Voiceover	...the nursing staff was busy losing the lottery...
28937	Dr. Kelso's Voiceover	...his original doctor was thanking a garbageman...
28938	Dr. Kelso's Voiceover	...and the covering physician was incapacitated.
28939	Dr. Kelso	And what was Mr. Foster doing? He was dying in the hands of the interns.
28940	Dr. Kelso	How did I do, Dr. Dorian?
28941	Doug	Sorry I'm late. I got the keys to my Miata stuck in the cadaver.
28942	Dr. Cox	Cut to the chase there, Pee Pants.
28943	Doug	Uh, Mr. Foster's death was the result of a pulmonary embolism, probably caused by the 21 hour flight he was on from India. But Dr. Flannery, the radiologist should have caught it on the scan.
28944	Dr. Kelso	Working from an inaccurate report, there was nothing any of you could have done to prevent Mr. Foster from passing. Which, I guess, leads us to you, Dr. Flannery.
28945	J.D.'s Narration	After a day like today, there's only one thing you could do.
28946	J.D.	To bad radiologists!
28947	Dr. Cox	Wait, wait, let me get in on this. Let's also have a toast to Mr. Foster's widow and his fatherless kids.
28948	Elliot	Dr. Cox, it wasn't our fault.
28949	Dr. Cox	Oh. Because you were lucky. You know as well as I do that it could have been any one of your faults. Congrats again. Have a uh, have a swell party.
28950	J.D.'s Narration	It's never easy when someone accuses you of screwing up. Especially when you know it's true.
28951	J.D.'s Narration	And when that happens, you can't shrug it off. Because the best way to learn from your mistakes is to carry them with you.
28952	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
28953	Open	Cafeteria: Lloyd the Delivery Guy is air-drumming along with a beat. Janitor and Ted watch. Todd enters.
28954	Todd	What's going on?
28955	Janitor	Ted and I are putting together an air band for that contest at the bar. Someone's got to win those water park tickets, it might as well be us. Lloyd, slammin' solo, but I have to ask you, how's things coming with the drug problem?
28956	Lloyd	Three days sober.
28957	Janitor	Excellent. OK, we'll be in touch.
28958	J.D.	Well, Mrs. Nichols, it was an honor being your doctor.
28959	Mrs. Nichols	Oh, you're such a nice young man. I'd love to set you up with my grand-niece.
28960	J.D.	Oh, thank you, but I'm not big on blind dates, and I know, I haven't hit it in awhile, but there's good reason for that.
28961	Dr. Cox	Two good reasons. His face and his personality.
28962	J.D.	Sticks and stones may break my bones!
28963	J.D.'s Thoughts	But words will hurt forever.
28964	J.D.	Anyway, for me to be set up with your niece, I'd need to know a lot more about her.
28965	Mrs. Nichols	She's single.
28966	J.D.'s Thoughts	My blind date should be here any second. I gotta thank Mrs. Nichols for setting this up.
28967	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, Mrs. Nichols, you blue-haired bitch! Wait, she's veering off. Phew!
28968	J.D.'s Thoughts	OK, Mrs. Nichols, your new hip is on the house because this girl is amazing! Yet there's something accessible about her. I wonder what it is.
28969	Julie	Ooh, I'm gonna have the carrot cake.
28970	J.D.'s Thoughts	So, she was a bit of a klutz.
28971	Julie	Did you see that? Please say no.
28972	J.D.	No.
28973	J.D.'s Narration	From that moment on, it was the greatest date ever. We had so much in common.
28974	Julie	I ride a scooter, I love Harry Potter so much I sometimes wish I was a wizard, and I've hated sports since I was a kid.
28975	J.D.	Me too! Do you ever, like, drift off and have weird fantasies?
28976	Julie	Sometimes.
28977	J.D.	So do you wanna see if they'll give us more coffee or do you just want to call it a night?
28978	J.D.'s Narration	And then she gave the world's best answer.
28979	Julie	Neither.
28980	Elliot	J.D., you home?
28981	J.D.	My roommate. Back in one second.
28982	Elliot	So, I guess your date sucked, huh?
28983	J.D.	Ha! Why don't you ask her if our date sucked. She's in my room.
28984	Elliot	Twenty bucks you blow it in less than five minutes.
28985	J.D.	Unlikely! Because what's waiting for me in my room is what's known in football terms as a slam dunk .
28986	Elliot	One Mississippi, two Mississippi...
28987	Julie	It's so late, I gotta get going, I have a dog and a fish, I have to feed them and walk them and stuff. I'm Julie, hi.
28988	Elliot	I was Elliot. Twenty bucks, please.
28989	J.D.	OK, double or nothing. I bet you I can jump from this couch to the counter. Check it! Eagle!
28990	Elliot	Pay me in the morning.
28991	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
28992	Open	Hallway.
28993	J.D.	Why would Julie just take off like that? I bet you my body intimidated her. That's it, I am selling that Bowflex on Craigslist.
28994	Elliot	Yeah, I'm sure you said something that sucked all of the romance out of the moment. You used to do that all the time when we were dating.
28995	J.D.	Like when?
28996	J.D.	Are you getting thicker? You feel a little thicker. What?
28997	J.D.	Fine, I may have told her that she smells like my mom. Which, by the way, I still maintain is a compliment.
28998	Elliot	Ugh.
28999	Jordan	What are you guys talking about?
29000	J.D.	Well...
29001	Elliot	J.D. has this habit...
29002	Jordan	Already bored.
29003	Jordan	Oh, look! Will you say goodbye to Jack? I have to drop him off at preschool.
29004	Dr. Cox	Oh. Bye, little man.
29005	Jordan	Uh, Perry, this is your son, not a rescued pit bull. Give him a kiss.
29006	Dr. Cox	Jordan, he's starting to look like a guy, and I'm just not real big on kissing guys. I mean, if my father wanted to show me affection he would just purposely miss when he threw bottles at my head.
29007	Jordan	You are gonna be a much better dad than your dad was. Now give him a proper goodbye.
29008	Dr. Cox	Son, Always a pleasure. And no more kissing.
29009	Jordan	What? You're crazy! That's right. He is.
29010	Carla	Well, I don't understand, why wouldn't you kiss him?
29011	Dr. Cox	Stay out of it, Carla.
29012	Mrs. Wilk	Stay out of what?
29013	Carla	Dr. Cox won't kiss his son.
29014	Mrs. Wilk	What is wrong with you?
29015	Dr. Cox	Ladies, hate to disappoint, but my quota for women who bug the living bajesus out of me has been met for the next billion years. Now, Mrs. Wilk, you have developed an allergy to Malfolan. However, I have come up with a new regimen that will enable us to continue treatment.
29016	Mrs. Wilk	OK.
29017	Carla	Oh, I think he described all the extra effort he put in just so you would tell him what an amazing doctor he is.
29018	Mrs. Wilk	Now that you've told me, it won't sound sincere.
29019	Carla	He won't care.
29020	Mrs. Wilk	Dr. Cox, you're amazing.
29021	Dr. Cox	It's just my job.
29022	Todd	Everyone's watching to see what you will do / Everyone's looking at you, whoa, Everybody's workin' for...
29023	Janitor	Well, uh, thanks for coming to the audition in costume.
29024	Todd	What costume?
29025	Janitor	Something funny?
29026	Turk	Dude, I just came up the perfect name for you band: Mercy Flush.
29027	Ted	Do you think this is easy?
29028	Janitor	I don't know what "it" is, but he's got it.
29029	Lloyd	He's gonna be trouble.
29030	Janitor	I know. But he is so damn talented.
29031	J.D.'s Narration	I convinced Julie to meet me by explaining that my comment in the bedroom was a simple miscommunication.
29032	J.D.	I wasn't saying that you smelled like my mom, I was saying that you smelled like memum. It's an exotic flower that's indigenous to the hills of Costa Rica.
29033	Julie	God, I feel so stupid.
29034	J.D.	Hugsies.
29035	J.D.'s Thoughts	Ohh, Mommy.
29036	Julie	I'll see you later?
29037	J.D.	Yes.
29038	Julie	Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh, I am so, so sorry.
29039	Elliot	Oh no, it happens.
29040	J.D.	It does, it happens.
29041	Julie	Bye.
29042	J.D.	Isn't she great?
29043	Elliot	So, you got the second date. Just don't repeat the same mistakes you made with me. For instance, don't speed down the road and pretend your brakes are out. I don't care if it got you laid once in high school. It is not funny, and I still have not forgiven you for killing that family's pony. But most importantly, if you ever find yourself in a romantic situation again, ignore whatever pops into your head. Just look into her eyes and say these exact words: I'm. So glad. I found you.
29044	J.D.	You're telling me what to say, next you're gonna be telling me how to kiss her. I mean, where does it end?
29045	Julie	You are such a good kisser, J.D.
29046	Elliot	Mmm, right back at'cha. And I love that you're calling me J.D.
29047	J.D.	Stay away from my girlfriend, Elliot. And stay away from my J.D. wigs!
29048	Lonnie	Dr. Cox, could you help me with a central line?
29049	Dr. Cox	Fine, Lonnie, but hand to God, if you so much as look at me for the next month I will mummify your head in surgical tape.
29050	Lonnie	Thank you Dr. Cox. Is he gone? No? Hello?
29051	Carla	Mrs. London, this is Dr. Cox. He's going to be your doctor.
29052	Dr. Cox	Good news. Your intestinal bleeding can be fixed with a very simple surgery.
29053	Mrs. London	Surgery? I'm a Jehovah's witness, I can't get a transfusion. We believe that blood should not be passed from person to person.
29054	Dr. Cox	Well, I'm a doctor, and we believe that without surgery, a patient in your condition can suffer from a major case of deadness.
29055	Carla	Don't worry, he'll figure out another way to treat you.
29056	Dr. Cox	Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha, no he won't!
29057	J.D.	I am having so much fun hanging out with you. Can you believe we've been talking for two hours?
29058	Julie	Seriously?
29059	J.D.	Nah, while you were in the bathroom I set the clock two hours ahead so you'd think time was just flying by.
29060	Julie	Really? While I was in the bathroom, I wrote my name on the mirror with my finger so the next time you took a hot shower and it fogged up, you'd think that ghosts where trying to tell you to be with me.
29061	J.D.'s Narration	Looking at her, I knew what the future held for Julie and me.
29062	J.D.	Smile.
29063	Julie	Oh, God this mask is hot.
29064	J.D.	Thanks for doing that.
29065	J.D.	I wanted a picture of us old, you know? That way if one of us dies in a tragic skiing accident, we'll always have that memory of us together.
29066	Julie	That's so sweet! So what do you want to do now?
29067	J.D.'s Thoughts	OK, romance is in the air. You gotta say something. Tell her about the hit and run. Nah, she probably loves ponies. Ask her if she's been tested. Why are all these odd thoughts popping into my head? My, God, look at the size of her feet. Tell her! Stop it! OK, the silence is going on too long. Just say that thing that Elliot told you, even though it's stupid.
29068	J.D.	I'm really glad I found you.
29069	Turk	...To liiiiive!!
29070	Janitor	Yes! That was very tight.
29071	Dr. Kelso	Well, seems I've stumbled into the Time Well Spent ward. Back into your cage, Ted.
29072	Ted	Oh, God, what have I done?
29073	Dr. Kelso	Turkleton, I need you to volunteer to speak at a critical care conference this weekend.
29074	Turk	Yeah, I don't see that happening, Bobby.
29075	Dr. Kelso	Excuse me?
29076	Turk	It's not like you're the king around here.
29077	J.D.	Ahhhh, morning, Elliot. By the way, Julie's here. I'm not gonna kiss and tell.
29078	Elliot	Oh, really? Because I just got your text that said bone city.
29079	J.D.	Oh, really? That came through?
29080	J.D.'s Narration	When you care about something, the last thing you want is for it to be taken away.
29081	J.D.'s Narration	Whether it's a newfound hobby...
29082	Turk	Sir, why did you want to see me in here?
29083	Dr. Kelso	Quick announcement, people. From this moment on, there will be no air-banding allowed in the hospital. The king has spoken. Thank you very much.
29084	J.D.'s Narration	...or the image of someone you looked up to.
29085	Carla	So, tell me. What are you gonna do with our Jehovah's Witness?
29086	Dr. Cox	I'm not gonna do anything.
29087	Carla	So what's gonna happen?
29088	Dr. Cox	I would say she's probably going to die.
29089	J.D.'s Narration	as for me, all I lost was my pride.
29090	Julie	Hey, Elliot. Oh, um, J.D.? I'm glad I found you, too.
29091	Elliot	Well, that sounds familiar.
29092	Julie	HYOOOOOO!
29093	Julie	Ow. I think there's a chotchkie in my bum.
29094	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
29095	J.D.'s Narration	So I had to use Elliot's advice with Julie. Luckily, she's not great at gloating.
29096	Elliot	Ha ha, you had sex last night with a beautiful girl that you really like!
29097	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes she needs a little help.
29098	J.D.	Uh, you probably meant, "If it weren't for you, I'd still be dating my laptop."
29099	Elliot	Right. In your face, ha ha! Thank you. You know, I actually like Julie, so don't do that thing you always do.
29100	J.D.	If you're referring to the game Find the Saltine, relax. I don't even play that with Turk any more.
29101	Elliot	No, I am talking about how you go a million miles an hour the minute you fall for someone. Don't go too quickly, or just like I said, you'll just end up with another beautiful girl.
29102	J.D.	Dating my laptop.
29103	Elliot	Dating you laptop. Thank you.
29104	Lloyd	I knew he'd be trouble.
29105	Janitor	Hey, come on now, we're still a band, huh? Let's bring it in.
29106	Janitor	Cool cats on three. One, two, three.
29107	Janitor, Ted & Lloyd	Cool cats!
29108	Janitor	Let's roll.
29109	Carla	When Mrs. Wilk was allergic to Malfolan, you found a way around it. Why aren't you doing the same for our Jehovah's Witness?
29110	Dr. Cox	Because Mrs. Wilk didn't choose to have her allergy, so...
29111	Carla	Wait, there's a young man behind you with a quick medical question.
29112	Jordan	Will you kiss me?
29113	Dr. Cox	Leaving.
29114	Jordan	You know, you're eventually gonna have to kiss your boy.
29115	Carla	And you will have to treat that Jehovah's Witness.
29116	Jordan	Mmhmm.
29117	Dr. Cox	God. Elevator.
29118	Dr. Cox	He's got my back, Even if I don't technically believe in Him.
29119	Turk	Behind your ear.
29120	J.D.	My friend, you have found the saltine! But don't tell Elliot we're still playing!
29121	J.D.'s Thoughts	Why do I care what Elliot thinks? She's not right about everything. I mean, I'm not gonna go too fast with Julie.
29122	J.D's Thoughts	Ooh, land for sale.
29123	Turk	Dr. Kelso? I'll go to that conference.
29124	Dr. Kelso	Turkleton, I have many more pressing issues, starting with a gigantic paralyzed wife and ending with a gay son who has just written a scathing musical about me called "Dr. Dad" which,
29125	Janitor	It was never about you saying no to the conference. It's about the way you said it.
29126	Janitor	You see that man there? His biggest pet peeve, except for employees storing deer meat in his office mini-fridge, is people being disrespectful to him.
29127	Turk	Do you play?
29128	Carla	Lonnie, what are you doing?
29129	Lonnie	Since Dr. Cox won't treat Mrs. London, we have to transfer her to another facility.
29130	Dr. Cox	All right, listen up and listen good. I will kill anyone who tells Carla about this. That includes you Mrs. London. First, I will save your life, then I'll take it away. Let's get to work. Lonnie. Are you looking at me again?
29131	Lonnie	No.
29132	Julie	Are we crazy to be thinking about buying this?
29133	J.D.	No, it's a sound investment and a great addition to my portfolio.
29134	J.D.'s Thoughts	Which consists of two shares of Eastern Airlines stock and a pack of unopened Les Mis trading cards.
29135	Elliot	J.D., this is a mistake.
29136	J.D.	You're not broker of the year Whit Prowdy.
29137	Elliot	Don't do this, you're going too fast.
29138	J.D.	Why should I believe you?
29139	Elliot	Because honesty is my business.
29140	J.D.	I hate you, Whit Prowdy.
29141	Turk	Sir, can I talk to you for a second?
29142	Dr. Kelso	Just you, or all the Turkleton's?
29143	Janitor	We don't just rock together, we roll together.
29144	Janitor, Ted, Turk & Lloyd	Cool Cats.
29145	Turk	Sir, I want to apologize for how I spoke to you. It was extremely disrespectful and I can promise you, it will not happen again.
29146	Dr. Kelso	You bet your ass it won't.
29147	Carla	OK, so what's the deal, crankypants?
29148	Dr. Cox	I am just sick and tired of having to live up to everyone's expectations. Lonnie needs a central line. You want me to help Mrs. London, and every patient in this dump looks at me for some miracle cure. I mean, honestly, Carla, with Jehovah as my witness, sometimes it is just too much.
29149	Carla	Yeah, yeah. I'm not buying it. You've been putting up with that stuff around here for over twenty years.
29150	Dr. Cox	It's not just here, it's home, too. Jordan expects me to be this this amazing, sensitive father.
29151	Carla	So that's what this is about? You shouldn't sweat the sensitive dad stuff. You'll get there.
29152	Dr. Cox	You don't know anything.
29153	Carla	Oh really? How is it going with your Jehovah's Witness patient?
29154	Dr. Cox	Better.
29155	J.D.	How did you know I'd move too fast with Julie?
29156	Dr. Cox	How do you know that I can be that kind of Dad?
29157	Turk	How did you know that Dr. Kelso just wanted respect?
29158	Elliot	Because I know you.
29159	Carla	Because I know you.
29160	Janitor	Because I know him.
29161	Todd	This is so cool.
29162	Lonnie	What's happening? Dr. Cox didn't make eye holes.
29163	J.D.'s Narration	I think it's important to listen to the people who know us best. Because if you do, you might get to rock...
29164	J.D.'s Narration	...you might get the confidence to be the father you want to be...
29165	Dr. Cox	Give me this little boy.
29166	Dr. Cox	I love you. I love you so much I'm gonna make a sandwich out of you.
29167	Jordan	Where are you going?
29168	Dr. Cox	Jack's gonna devour me now, see you later!
29169	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, sometimes it's fun to not listen and do whatever the hell you want.
29170	J.D.	So, we bought it. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to kiss my lady on my new half-acre.
29171	Elliot	She is not graceful.
29172	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
29173	Open	Half-Acre. J.D. and Julie sit on the deck.
29174	J.D.'s Narration	Behold Julie Quinn. Ahhhh. We fell for each other so quickly, we decided to buy some property together, and built a deck on it.
29175	J.D.	To our half-acre.
29176	Julie	Hey, look, the Clarks are home.
29177	J.D.'s Narration	Unfortunately, the Clarks felt that if we weren't building a house, we weren't technically their neighbors.
29178	J.D. & Julie	Hey, Clarks!
29179	Mr. Clark	Go to hell!
29180	J.D.	OK! Hey, Buzz, I'm gonna beat you in poker next time!
29181	J.D.'s Narration	The Morgans on the other side were much friendlier. But I don't think we're gonna have them over again.
29182	J.D.	Hi.
29183	Mr. Morgan	Y'all are a cute couple.
29184	Julie	Thanks.
29185	Mr. Morgan	Wanna buy a baby?
29186	J.D.	Oooh, sweetie!
29187	Julie	No.
29188	J.D.	I'm sorry, no thank you.
29189	Mr. Morgan	I'll throw in a crib.
29190	J.D.	Throwing in a crib.
29191	J.D.'s Narration	It didn't matter, because I was happy to look out at my beautiful half-acre with my sweet, but klutzy gal.
29192	J.D.	You OK, buttercup?
29193	Julie	The glass broke in my mouth.
29194	J.D.'s Narration	Turk and I had discovered a new way to deal with Kelso's bad moods.
29195	Dr. Kelso	Dammit, people, if you can't fill out your patients' insurance forms, then...
29196	Turk	Spoonful of peanut butter, sir?
29197	J.D.'s Narration	It usually bought us a few minutes of peace. But then Carla said something that deeply disturbs every man on God's green earth.
29198	Carla	I just got my period.
29199	Carla	This really sucks. I've been trying to get pregnant for two months now.
29200	J.D.	I almost bought a baby yesterday.
29201	Carla	What?
29202	J.D.'s Thoughts	Don't tell them, in case you want it later!
29203	J.D.	Nothing.
29204	Turk	Don't worry about it, baby, we'll just keep trying. Remember that magazine article I read about how important it is for a man to have a high-protein diet?
29205	Carla	Turk, for the last time, you are not eating ribs while we do it.
29206	Turk	You never let me have no fun!
29207	Janitor	You know, I'm not gonna have a kid until that genetic technology they've been talking about is available for everyone.
29208	Carla	So you'd want to pick the sex and eye color?
29209	Janitor	No. Gills. When that day comes it's goodbye, hospital, hello father-son treasure hunting team.
29210	Carla	Wow. Well, you better get cracking. What are you, like, 45?
29211	Janitor	43. I know I look a little older, but that's because I drink and smoke heavily, and work with chemicals, and sleep on my face.
29212	Carla	No hard feelings?
29213	Janitor	All right.
29214	Janitor	I swear on my unborn fish-boy's life, she will pay.
29215	Dr. Kelso	I need some milk.
29216	Orderly	Yo, Glass Man!
29217	J.D.	What's Glass Man?
29218	Turk	It's a basketball thing, I'm a great rebounder.
29219	J.D.	You know who else is a great rebounder? Dr. Mickhead.
29220	J.D.	His wife was killed on Saturday.
29221	Dr. Mickhead	Hey, guys.
29222	Turk & J.D.	Hey, Mickhead!
29223	Turk	The police cleared him yet?
29224	J.D.	He's still a person of interest.
29225	J.D.'s Narration	There was sexual energy everywhere.
29226	J.D.'s Narration	For the women, it was because of the dashing new gynecologist, Dr. Matthews.
29227	Dr. Cox	Jordan, why would you need seven pap smears in one month?
29228	Jordan	I got a lot of pap. Move your head so I can see.
29229	J.D.'s Narration	And for the men, there was a new, sexy Latina nurse: Nurse Martinez.
29230	Nurse Martinez	Would you guys stop doing that?
29231	J.D.'s Narration	Yep, there was eye candy for all. And only one thing could upset this delicate balance.
29232	Janitor	Wow. She looks like a young Carla.
29233	J.D.	That's why they call him the glass man.
29234	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
29235	Open	Elliot's apartment. Elliot is eating cereal, and there is a ruckus coming from J.D.'s bedroom.
29236	J.D.'s Narration	Julie and I had overslept. We didn't have time for our usual seven minutes of love-making, so we had to fake it.
29237	Julie	Ohh, yeah! Don't stop!
29238	J.D.	Pull my hair! Whee!
29239	Julie	Shut up and take it, you stupid bitch!
29240	J.D.	OK, we can stop there. Um, now it's time to ring the sex gong.
29241	Julie	What?
29242	J.D.	Uh, Turk and I got sex gongs in Chinatown. We're supposed to ring them whenever each one of us gets lucky. And even though I don't live with him anymore, I like to think that somewhere, somehow he hears it and it makes him happy.
29243	Julie	That's so funny.
29244	Turk	Yeah, buddy! Ha ha! That's my dog.
29245	J.D.	Hope my gong wasn't too loud for you this morning. I know it can be. It's a loud gong! I mean, it's like, gonnggg!
29246	Elliot	J.D., I knew you were faking it because at the end you didn't say "bombs away."
29247	J.D.	How could I forget my sexiest move?
29248	J.D.'s Thoughts	Great, now Julie thinks I'm lame, and weird and pathetic.
29249	Elliot	J.D., she likes you. Just do yourself a favor and stay out of your head for once.
29250	J.D.'s Thoughts	OK, from this moment on, I am officially out of my head.
29251	Carla's Thoughts	Ugh, I'm an old hag. I mean look at her, everything's so tight and perky. Come on, Carla, it's not her fault. Just do what you always do and turn the other cheek. And quietly spread the rumor that she's a guy.
29252	Carla	Hey, Turk, guess what.
29253	Turk	She's not a guy, honey. Besides, "young Carla" is a compliment.
29254	Carla	Really? So how would you feel if said, "hey, it's skinny Turk?"
29255	Carla's Thought's	And now his boyfriend will comfort him.
29256	J.D.	Don't listen to her, brown bear, your body is fierce!
29257	Turk	Is it?
29258	J.D.	Like Taye Diggs'!
29259	Turk	Taye Diggs.
29260	Carla's Narration	Luckily, I had a best friend, too.
29261	Elliot	So, uh, what did "her" name used to be?
29262	Carla	Hm, how about Alberto?
29263	Elliot	I'll spread the word.
29264	Carla	Alberto.
29265	Turk	So when am I gonna get to meet Julie?
29266	J.D.	Do I want her to meet Turk this soon? What if he doesn't like her?
29267	Turk	What are you doing?
29268	J.D.	I'm saying all my thoughts out loud so I don't mess this relationship up.
29269	Turk	I don't understand.
29270	J.D.	I forgot, sometimes Turk is slow. You know what? It's time for her to meet the people in my life. I think she's gonna do great.
29271	Julie	Did you know J.D.'s parents thought he was going to be a girl? They didn't have a name ready when he was born, so until he was three years old they called him Joanna.
29272	Dr. Cox	I don't know who you are, but thank you for this.
29273	Dr. Mickhead	So what do you think?
29274	Julie	Sure, I guess I can hide this in my basement for you.
29275	Dr. Mickhead	OK, great, great.
29276	J.D.	You know what, let's just give that back. Thanks, nice to see you Mickhead.
29277	Turk	Look, Julie, I'm very protective of J.D. So it's going to take a lot for you to win me over.
29278	Julie	Uh, J.D. wanted me to introduce you to my godfather.
29279	Billy Dee Williams	Yeah, Julie's a great girl.
29280	Turk	YAAAAHHAAHAAAA HHAAHAAA! Lando Calrissian! Come here!
29281	Billy Dee Williams	Oh, you can call me Billy Dee.
29282	Turk	Yes, Lando. Yes.
29283	Elliot	Look, Julie, you already won Carla and me over because you're nice to J.D. And you won Jordan over because you bought the first round.
29284	Carla	I got lemon drops!
29285	Elliot	Oh, Carla, the last time I did one of those I agreed to go on a date with a chick in my Art History class. Mm-mm.
29286	Jordan	Yeah, can we go somewhere less college-y? One of the boys here could be the baby I gave up in high school.
29287	Carla	We aren't too old to hang out here. Come on.
29288	Elliot	Mmmm...
29289	Carla's Thoughts	OK, time to dial up the Spanish. That always makes them feel guilty that they haven't spent more time around minorities.
29290	Carla	Come on, mis amigas, we don't have to vámonos, pretty please?
29291	Jordan	All right.
29292	Julie	All right.
29293	Elliot	Let's do it.
29294	Carla	To being young!
29295	Carla	You guys, for real, you're my best friends.
29296	Elliot	So, Carol, did you like jazz?
29297	Carol	Ha ha, yeah!
29298	Elliot	How much?
29299	Dr. Cox	Aaand, look what we have here. It is a visual representation of how alcohol affects people of different ages. We have the young...
29300	Julie	Good morning!
29301	Dr. Cox	...the slightly older...
29302	Elliot	Please stop talking.
29303	Dr. Cox	...the slightly older still...
29304	Dr. Cox	...and lastly, the very, very, very old. She is unconscious and virtually unwakable. Witness:
29305	Dr. Cox	Jordaroo! Jordalicious! Jordaroni! Uh-huh.
29306	J.D.	Ha! We'll get you ladies some more coffee. Jordan, if you're willing to pay for it, just sit there frozen. How very generous.
29307	Julie	That's so funny!
29308	J.D.	Yeah.
29309	Turk	Dude, Julie's awesome.
29310	J.D.	Doesn't it bother you that she never laughs at anything?
29311	Turk	What do you mean?
29312	J.D.	I mean when something's funny she never laughs. She just says "that's so funny." It's kind of annoying.
29313	Turk	J.D., this is an intervention. First off, I just want to say everyone here loves you. This is a safe space. But you are such a commit-ophobe. Every time you date a girl with actual potential, you wind up ruining it over some trivial reason. Let's think about some of the great girls you let slip through your fingers: Kylie, Jamie, Gift Shop Girl, Mini McSkinny, Mole Butt, Tina Two-Kids, Rumple Fugly, I'm forgetting someone.
29314	Carla's Thought's	Oh, my God, Turk, if you forget Elliot, she's going to cry.
29315	Carla	Turk, aren't you forgetting the greatest girl of them all?
29316	Turk	Heidi Horseface!
29317	Elliot	Me! Turk, she is talking about me. OK?
29318	J.D.	Relax, Elliot. You're Mole Butt.
29319	Elliot	Really? Ha! Sorry, Turk.
29320	Carla	J.D. There's somebody else here who wants to say something.
29321	Billy Dee Williams	Hey, don't mess this up, man. Be smooth.
29322	Turk	Lando's right.
29323	Billy Dee Williams	Billy Dee!
29324	Turk	Lando.
29325	Dr. Cox	Joanna, now I'm not much for this sensitive crap, but darn it all, you've finally found someone who's willing to let you annoy them instead of me.
29326	Elliot	Don't screw this up J.D., or you're going to end up where you always do. Lying on that couch in the fetal position, wishing you hadn't driven another one away.
29327	Dr. Cox	If Jordan were conscious, she'd she'd agree. Aw, now who put that fake arrow through her head? Huh? Which one of you? It was me. I did it.
29328	J.D.	I gotta get cooking. People are going to be here for this barbeque any second.
29329	Julie	So your friends really like me?
29330	J.D.	They're crazy about you. They're worried I'm gonna mess this whole thing up.
29331	Julie	Nah. You're not gonna be a jerk and do something like that, are you?
29332	J.D.	The only jerk around here is the spicy marinade on this Jamaican chicken, mon.
29333	Julie	That's so funny.
29334	J.D.	It is, Julie, it it is. Why do you always do that?
29335	Julie	Do what?
29336	J.D.	Well you never laugh when something's funny. You just say "that's so funny."
29337	Julie	Does that bother you?
29338	Janitor	Don't mean to bother anybody. I'm just showing Nurse Martinez here around the hospital. That is our Chief of Medicine, that is a patient, and that is you in twenty years. OK, let's go look at dead people.
29339	Carla	That nurse makes me feel so damn old.
29340	Dr. Kelso	Oh, calm down, Nurse Espinosa. I have it on good authority that she's a dude.
29341	Carla	I made that stuff up.
29342	Dr. Kelso	Then it's time for her to meet Bob Kelso, licensed hetero.
29343	Mrs. Wilk	Sweetie, you're not old. You don't have crows feet, your bra size hasn't gone from a 34B to a 40 long, and you don't have arthritis. Neither do I, but that's how it gets you.
29344	Carla's Narration	And then Mrs. Wilk said something that really surprised me.
29345	Mrs. Wilk	I mean, it's not like you're trying to get pregnant and you can't.
29346	Carla	Actually, I am.
29347	Mrs. Wilk	Oh.
29348	Carla's Narration	Of course, none of us were surprised that J.D. made this happen.
29349	Elliot	Why is Julie behind that bush, crying?
29350	J.D.	Who knows? Could be anything.
29351	J.D.	You know what's interesting, Turk? She's not saying "that's so sad," she's actually crying.
29352	Turk	You're an idiot.
29353	J.D.	Yes, I am.
29354	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
29355	Open	Admissions Area.
29356	Carla's Thoughts	I tried, but I just couldn't get babies off my mind.
29357	J.D.	Excuse me, fellas, gotta take a whiz. Wait a minute, why am I rushing? All right.
29358	Carla	You're disgusting.
29359	J.D.	She's right. I am disgusting. I am disgustingly incapable of carrying on a relationship with someone I actually like. I mean, I apologized to her, so I think we're cool for now, but it won't last. Every time she says "that's so funny" it's - it's like nails on a chalkboard to me.
29360	Turk	Well you're just too picky about women.
29361	J.D.	You used to be the same way. Somehow you got over it and now you're married.
29362	Turk	That's because I was never as bad as you.
29363	J.D.	Oh, really? Remember Whitney the snapper?
29364	Turk	Ugh.
29365	Turk	Hey, I just wanted to say thanks for dinner tonight.
29366	Whitney	And for dessert, you're going to get a little Whitney a la mode.
29367	Turk	Get out.
29368	Turk	It's...too much.
29369	Elliot	Carla, you've only been off the pill for two months. Why are you getting a fertility test?
29370	Carla's Thoughts	Because I'm old and the crock pot is on the fritz.
29371	Carla	No reason.
29372	Nurse	Carla Espinosa?
29373	Carla	Yes?
29374	Nurse	Dr. Matthews will see you now.
29375	Elliot	Oh! OK, he is super cute, so do not look into his eyes. You could get lost.
29376	Carla	I'll be fine.
29377	Elliot	Ask him if he remembers me from my pelvic exam! Ask him!
29378	Julie	I made popcorn!
29379	J.D.	You OK, sweetness?
29380	Julie	I'll go make some more.
29381	J.D.	All right. Why are we watching a movie again?
29382	Turk	It's called immersion therapy. What we're about to watch is going to make her say "that's so funny" so many times that eventually it's not going to bother you anymore.
29383	J.D.	But how can you guarantee that she's going to laugh at this movie?
29384	Turk	I can't. But Uncle Buck can.
29385	Julie	That's so funny. That's so funny. Look how big that pancake is, that's so funny.
29386	J.D.	Make. Her. Stop.
29387	Julie	That's so funny.
29388	Carla's Thoughts	This guy's not that hot.
29389	Dr. Matthews	Well, you've only been trying for two months, so I don't think you need to worry about a fertility test yet. Unless, of course, you're over 35.
29390	Carla's Thoughts	Well, buddy, I'm 36 and OK with it.
29391	Dr. Matthews	So how old are you?
29392	Carla's Thoughts	Ravish me!
29393	Carla	I'm 29.
29394	Dr. Matthews	Yeah, I've been seeing a lot of 29 year-olds lately.
29395	Carla	Oh, my God, really?
29396	Dr. Matthews	Like her.
29397	Jordan	Call me JJ.
29398	J.D.	The immersion therapy didn't work.
29399	Turk	Dude, relax. I was a Psych minor in college. The next time she says "that's so funny," I want you to pretend she says "that's so money."
29400	J.D.	Oooh. I like that.
29401	Turk	Yeah. It's called a word replacement...ism.
29402	Dr. Cox	This is the dumbest conversation I've ever heard.
29403	Dr. Kelso	You should hear this one.
29404	Elliot	Oh, I remember my first exam with Dr. Matthews. He said "you're very healthy down there." And then I said "right back at'cha." And then there was this weird, little awkward pause, so I said "well, I like to keep a clean shop," and then he asked to see my insurance card. So how did your fertility test go?
29405	Carla	He said everything's A-OK.
29406	Dr. Kelso & Dr. Cox	Oh, that's bull!
29407	Turk	Excuse me, sir?
29408	Dr. Kelso	I was talking to these ladies.
29409	Dr. Cox	I was talking to you ladies. Newbie, listen to me. You never stop being annoyed by the little things, ever. Take, uh, take Gandhi, here. Your wife is the bossiest women I've ever met. You're trying to tell me that you're not bothered by that anymore?
29410	Turk	Sometimes I watch Roots to remind myself how good I have it.
29411	J.D.	Me too.
29412	Dr. Cox	Everyone is annoying. I mean, take take Jordan. She is just now returning from what I can only assume is her eleventh gynecological visit this month.
29413	Jordan	I'm saving my breast exam for when you go away next month.
29414	Dr. Cox	Upsetting, but we persevere. Bottom line, there's no such thing as a perfect person. You, tell her.
29415	Turk	All right, if you've found someone who makes you happy just sitting around holding hands, then eventually all that other stuff won't matter.
29416	Turk	Dude, not me.
29417	J.D.	I know.
29418	Dr. Kelso	Nurse Espinosa, I know you didn't take that fertility test. People think I am some clueless old geezer, but nothing that happens in these hallways gets by me.
29419	Dr. Mickhead	It wasn't me! I didn't do it!
29420	Carla	It's just that if I take that fertility test and I found out that I missed my window to have a kid, I'll never forgive myself.
29421	Dr. Kelso	If you're worried about your biological legacy, as the father of a son who not only wrote a musical based on my life but is currently shacked up with the actor playing me, honestly, sweetheart, it's not all it's cracked up to be. But I know you. You'll find out eventually. So why don't you just turn around and tell him?
29422	Carla	Oh. Dr. Matthews? I'm 36.
29423	Dr. Matthews	Oh. Well let's get you that fertility test.
29424	Carla	OK.
29425	Carla's Thoughts	Here goes nothing.
29426	J.D.	Ha ha. One-a-day vitamins. I'll tell you how they could double their profits: Two-a-day vitamins.
29427	Julie	That's so funny! I'm sorry I said "that's so funny," I know that drives you crazy.
29428	J.D.	You know what? I really couldn't care less.
29429	Julie	So what do we do now?
29430	J.D.	I don't know. I mean, we already got the half-acre, right? And I imagine we'll eventually be able to build a house on it, and a little backyard, room for a slip and slide for our kids, Gilligan and The Skipper. I know, I'm sorry, I gotta do it, I lost a bet to Turk. And I don't want to rush things, but I feel good about this. I don't know, I feel like you and I could go the distance.
29431	Julie	Um, actually I meant what do you want to order from take-out for dinner?
29432	J.D.	Oh. Tapas.
29433	Julie	I love tapas.
29434	J.D.	Great for sharing.
29435	Julie	Sharing is fun.
29436	J.D.	I love it. Just share and...
29437	Julie	Share.
29438	J.D.	So you really don't think about that kind of stuff?
29439	Julie	J.D., I'm only 23, and I don't even know if I want any of that stuff, and certainly not for the five or ten years.
29440	J.D.	You know what? We've just started dating, so I have a feeling this conversation goes down a really bad road. Why don't we just say we're never going to talk about it ever again, OK?
29441	Julie	OK.
29442	J.D.	OK.
29443	Julie	OK. Whew.
29444	J.D.	OK. So you really feel that way?
29445	J.D.	So here I am again. I can't believe I broke up with her. Why do I keep doing this?
29446	Elliot	J.D., this was totally different. You didn't break up with her because she said "that's so funny," or because she was like Mini McSkinny and singing Christmas carols in the summertime.
29447	J.D.	It was August! The weather was far from frightful!
29448	Turk	You broke up with her for a real reason. Right, Carla?
29449	Carla	Definitely.
29450	Carla's Thoughts	Oh, my God, what did I just agree to? All I can think about is getting my test results back. I have to get out of my head. Just say something positive.
29451	Carla	She's a keeper, J.D.! You'll never do better.
29452	J.D.'s Narration	I guess it's in our nature to think about the future. Especially if our dreams might not come true.
29453	Carla	Thanks. Thanks, Dr. Matthews, that's great news!
29454	Carla	Turk!
29455	Turk	Yeah, baby?
29456	Carla	Get over here.
29457	J.D.	Yeah, buddy!
29458	J.D.'s Narration	As for my future, I had finally gotten to the place where I was looking for the right person. And I knew she was out there. Even if I couldn't quite see her yet.
29459	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
29460	Open	Elliot's apartment.
29461	J.D.'s Narration	It's been a week, but for some reason, I'm still having trouble moving past my break-up with Julie. Luckily my roommate knows how to take care of me.
29462	J.D.	Nice! Now it's a picture of you and me on a unicorn.
29463	Elliot	J.D., that's Gary Busey.
29464	J.D.	It's uncanny!
29465	J.D.'s Narration	Now that we lived together, Elliot and I were getting tighter every day.
29466	Elliot	AAAAHHH!! OH!! OH, MY GOD, THAT'S COLD!! AAAHHH!!! J.D.!!!
29467	J.D.'s Narration	She wasn't great at practical jokes.
29468	J.D.'s Narration	But still, we'd become inseparable.
29469	Elliot	Thanks for the ride, buddy! See you upstairs!
29470	Elliot	Todd, gun show!
29471	Todd	Don't worry, ma'am, I got permits for these. Go ahead and touch them, the safety's on. Doosh!
29472	Patient	I keep getting lightheaded and passing out but you haven't seen it because it only happens when I yawn.
29473	Dr. Cox	No problem. Newbie, quick, tell him a story.
29474	J.D.	Lay off Bob, OK? I'm still upset about this whole Julie thing...
29475	J.D.	You know in high school once, there was a...
29476	J.D.	Hope that hurt.
29477	Dr. Cox	Totally worth it. Now, I need one of you two clowns to do a neurological workup on this guy. It's going to be a giant pain in the ass.
29478	Elliot	Hm.
29479	Dr. Cox	Hmm, Newbie. Looks like it's you. All the best.
29480	J.D.	Damn those roller blades. OK, everybody, let's gather round.
29481	J.D.'s Narration	After six months on the job, some interns can become completely overwhelmed.
29482	J.D.	Where's Rex?
29483	Jason	He's gone fetal again.
29484	J.D.	Put a blankie on him.
29485	Keith	I've got it!
29486	J.D.'s Narration	Unfortunately, young Keith had become competent so quickly that every word out of his chiseled mouth came tainted with an arrogant smugness that he couldn't hide no matter how hard he tried.
29487	Keith	Is there anything else I can do, Dr. Dorian?
29488	J.D.'s Narration	Right on cue.
29489	J.D.	No, Keith. All I need right now is a sip of your coffee to make me feel warm in my belly.
29490	J.D.	Aww, Keith, look what you did!
29491	Keith	Dr. Dorian, take my shirt.
29492	J.D.	You think you're better than me? With your rock-hard abs, and your dynamite areolas? You're not.
29493	Jason	Dr. D, what's on your back?
29494	J.D.	Those, Jason, are the panicked scratches of the adolescent raccoon. Though until animal control can get into my home, it's currently residing in my sock drawer.
29495	J.D.	I got this! Start it, Grandma!
29496	Elliot	OK.
29497	Janitor	Hm?
29498	Janitor	Mmhmm.
29499	Janitor	Woohoo! That was close.
29500	Open	ICU. J.D. enters massaging his forehead.
29501	J.D.	Ugh.
29502	Keith	You OK, Dr. Dorian?
29503	J.D.	Keith, it's like you're begging me to hate you.
29504	Keith	I don't feel like I am.
29505	J.D.	You can't stop, can you?
29506	Dr. Cox	Newbie, today!
29507	J.D.'s Narration	We were both a little edgy because our favorite patient, Mrs. Wilk, had developed a lung infection and needed to be intubated for a week. So basically, we had to put her in a coma. Of course, at her age, there's always a chance that she'll never wake up.
29508	J.D.	A whole week of sleep. You're gonna have some killer bed head. I'm nervous, I'm sorry, I love bed head, look, check this.
29509	Dr. Cox	Marge, the patient should not have to be braver than you.
29510	Mrs. Wilk	Go easy on him, he's my fellow. Now listen. If this doesn't work, I want you to just let me go. Don't let me linger.
29511	J.D.'s Narration	Even though you'd think we'd all be used to this kind of stuff by now, when a patient has been around for a while, it gets to everyone., no matter how long they've been here.
29512	Dr. Kelso	Turkleton, you're a surgeon, when did you ever deal with Mrs. Wilk?
29513	Mrs. Wilk	You're not extending your arm. It's called "pop and lock," Christopher, not "pop and dangle."
29514	Turk	OK.
29515	Mrs. Wilk	OK?
29516	Turk	Oh! OK! Uh-huh!
29517	Mrs. Wilk	You're getting it now, baby! You're getting!
29518	Turk	I'll see you later, baby!
29519	Mrs. Wilk	Little Michael! Little Michael!
29520	Turk	Changed my life.
29521	J.D.	All right. Here we go. See you in a couple days.
29522	Mrs. Wilk	Let's hope so.
29523	J.D.'s Narration	Everyone has their own way of getting stuff off their minds.
29524	J.D.'s Narration	Some like to work it off.
29525	J.D.'s Narration	Others try to drink it away.
29526	J.D.'s Narration	For me, I had heard that the piercing girl at the mall was easy.
29527	J.D.	Thanks for penciling me in.
29528	Piercing Girl	Mmhmm.
29529	J.D.	Maybe later, you can show me where else you're pierced.
29530	Piercing Girl	Why wait till later?
29531	J.D.	All right.
29532	J.D.	Ahh! Uhhg! Ahh! Uggh!
29533	J.D.	I feel so close to you right now.
29534	J.D.	HOOOOO!!
29535	Elliot	Why do I always forget that I'm lactose intolerant?
29536	Turk	What are you guys doing down here?
29537	Elliot	Well, we were so bummed about Mrs. Wilk that we inhaled six gallons of ice cream.
29538	Carla	Would you tell Dr. Kelso to make this gym more female friendly?
29539	Elliot	Yeah, there's like no equipment for women down here.
29540	Todd	You know where there's all kinds of equipment for women? Todd-land.
29541	Turk	Dammit, Todd, what did I tell you about talking like that around my wife?
29542	Todd	Wait until she leaves and then say it?
29543	Turk	Exactly! You're welcome.
29544	Janitor	You saving this seat for your ex-wife?
29545	Dr. Cox	No, no. She's uh, she's over there.
29546	Guy	Do you know that guy pointing us?
29547	Jordan	No. You should fight him.
29548	Dr. Cox	One rule. No yapping. The only thing I want to hear is the sound of my liver drunkenly singing rugby songs.
29549	Janitor	Calm down. I'm not even here. Seriously. My shift at the hospital doesn't end for three hours. I hate that place and everyone in it.
29550	Dr. Cox	I'll drink to hate. Cheers.
29551	Dr. Cox	Ha ha ha! You're right. You know what else I hate about Kelso?
29552	Janitor	Hmm.
29553	Dr. Cox	His hair smells like a pet store.
29554	Janitor	Oh, actually, that;s my fault. I filled his hairspray can with dog sweat.
29555	Dr. Cox	Dogs don't sweat.
29556	Janitor	No?
29557	Dr. Cox	No.
29558	Janitor	What the hell am I putting in there?
29559	Jordan	Per, we're giving Bobby a ride home. Say goodnight to your girlfriend, I'm sure he'll be here tomorrow.
29560	Janitor	I will. Not that it matters.
29561	Dr. Cox	Not that I care.
29562	Jordan	Perry! Door closes at midnight! Ugh!
29563	Dr. Cox	Yeah, I gotta go.
29564	Janitor	Yup.
29565	J.D.	I tell you, I am done trying to pick up the random ladies, because every time I do, I end up with a bunch of face holes and an emerald stud in my peep.
29566	J.D.'s Thoughts	Which I'm keeping.
29567	Turk	Dude, you're surrounded by female interns who'd do anything to get with the big, bad attending. Make a booty call.
29568	Carla	He's right, people have been making booty calls since the dawn of time.
29569	Cavewoman	Cronk! Why you go now?
29570	J.D.	Oh, hey, you're up. Umm, look, I don't what you're looking for, but I just got out of a really tough relationship with this girl, Debbie. Also, my sister was carried off by a giant bird, so we've all been in mourning about that, and, um, my brother at my foot. But you were just fantastic. The things you were doing last night, they were, well, crazy. OK? Uh, so when I clear my own stuff up, I'd love to maybe get back together with you.
29571	Cavewoman	Hungry.
29572	J.D.	OK, I should really go.
29573	J.D.	You know what? I'll do it. If my partner in crime here will join me.
29574	Elliot	Ugh, J.D., booty calls are pathetic.
29575	Carla	More pathetic than emailing your high school boyfriend to see if his marriage is holding up, hello?
29576	Turk	Black hand-slap.
29577	Elliot	Uh-huh Carla, Mike Gorski wrote "keep in touch" in my yearbook, and that's all I'm doing, OK? Yes, he did say that his wife, Carol, is his "soulmate," and yes, they also have adorable twins, but he also said that he wishes she knew how to ski, so let's just see if they're still together, come winter. Yes, J.D., I will do this with you.
29578	Turk	Oh, Dr. Kelso.
29579	Dr. Cox	Where, uh, where's your wife going?
29580	Carla	He's gonna go ask Dr. Kelso if he can get some equipment for women in the gym.
29581	Dr. Cox	Oh, that is so nice.
29582	Carla	My baby's learning.
29583	Turk	Oh!
29584	Dr. Cox	Are you crazy? Why would you want your wife in the gym?
29585	Turk	Because, unlike you, I don't hate my wife.
29586	Dr. Cox	Yet. You don't hate your wife yet. But think about it, huh? You go to work, she's there. You go out, she's there. And when you go home, where is she?
29587	Turk	There.
29588	Dr. Cox	Ding! Women are everywhere. Except for the gym. That's why it's such a magical place. Don't ruin that, don't be that guy. Come on, you're so much more than that. I'm begging you.
29589	Dr. Cox	Uh, ma'am, I'm actually saving that for someone.
29590	Lady	Oh, that's not allowed.
29591	Dr. Cox	Fair enough. Say, that's some real nice pants you have on.
29592	Lady	Oh, well thank you. It's 40% off.
29593	Dr. Cox	What do you say you swing by my place and see if we can't get it 100% off?
29594	Dr. Cox	Had to be done.
29595	Janitor	Thanks, chief, I got your next one.
29596	Dr. Cox	Don't mention it.
29597	Janitor	So I'm late because Dorian parked his scooter behind my new van.
29598	Dr. Cox	Ohh.
29599	Janitor	Practically punctured a tire backing over the thing. Kid drives me crazy.
29600	Dr. Cox	Got a new van, huh?
29601	Janitor	Well, you blew up the old one over a bet, remember?
29602	Dr. Cox	Right. Ah, Dorian drives me crazy, too. But, what are you gonna do about it?
29603	Janitor	Stole this from his locker.
29604	Janitor	I come by here a couple times a week and just move stuff around, turn off his alarm, maybe cut off his bangs.
29605	Dr. Cox	Well, you're clearly in need of help, but gosh-darn it, I'm not gonna give it to you. How sound asleep do you think he really is?
29606	Janitor	Well, watch this.
29607	J.D.	What?
29608	Janitor	So what now?
29609	J.D.	WAAH! Naked. Excellent. Who took my emerald?
29610	J.D.'s Narration	After paying the Janitor the unreasonable sum of $90 to move my bed back home...
29611	J.D.'s Narration	...Elliot and I decided to round up out interns to pick out our respective booty calls.
29612	J.D.'s Narration	Welcome to Fugly-ville.
29613	Elliot	J.D., I really don't want to do this. Can't we just go home and put on our PJ's and watch Grey's Anatomy?
29614	J.D.	Oh, I do love that show. It's like they've been watching our lives and then just put it on TV.
29615	Elliot	Ha! Yeah.
29616	J.D.	Hmm.
29617	J.D.'s Narration	Carla listened at the door while I was helping Turk ask Dr. Kelso for new gym equipment.
29618	Dr. Kelso	What do you want?
29619	J.D.'s Narration	And then, Turk lied.
29620	Turk	Sir, we're here on behalf of Dr. Bianca. You know, the albino radiologist?
29621	Dr. Kelso	Oh, Jim! Who did he get pregnant this time? I tell you, the ladies can not resist that ivory rascal.
29622	Turk	Sir, Jim is demanding that he get new equipment in his lab.
29623	Dr. Kelso	Demanding?
29624	Dr. Kelso	There is no way in hell that Jim is getting new equipment!
29625	Turk	Sorry, baby. I tried.
29626	J.D.	Is there any change?
29627	Nurse	She's still the same.
29628	J.D.'s Narration	I guess in the back of my mind, I was hoping for a pleasant surprise. Because around here, most of them are unpleasant. Like when a guy you thought you connected with, suddenly turns on you...
29629	Dr. Cox	Hey, how's the day treating you big, guy?
29630	Janitor	You're not talking to me, are you, Doogie?
29631	Dr. Cox	Doogie?
29632	Janitor	This is a doctor no-fly zone, bubs. Speaking of flies, yours is down.
29633	Janitor	Oh no! He fell for the grade school zinger! You gotta go. Back to the game, boys.
29634	Carla	And you guys would not believe how hard my man fought for us.
29635	Turk	Well, you know, ladies, I do what I do, when I do what I do.
29636	J.D.'s Narration	...Or your boss blows your cover.
29637	Dr. Kelso	Turkleton, I have reconsidered your request, and I decided to give old Jim that new MRI machine.
29638	Turk	Woo. See, no, baby, wait. Aaah!
29639	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, my surprise came the next morning when I found out that Elliot had broken our no booty call agreement with my nemesis
29640	J.D.	Why is he wearing my robe?
29641	Keith	It fits me.
29642	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
29643	Open	Elliot's apartment. Elliot is still wearing only a sheet and Keith is in J.D.'s robe.
29644	Elliot	J.D., I can explain.
29645	J.D.	Oh, you did it twice! Somebody's a stud. We got a stud alert in here. Woop! Woop! Woop!
29646	J.D.	OK. This is just mathematically impossible.
29647	Elliot	Keith, Dr. Dorian and I have to go to work now, OK? So why don't you just clean all this up and drop off my laundry and then bring me a cup of coffee to the hospital? Run along, quick like a bunny.
29648	Keith	Sure thing, Elliot.
29649	Elliot	Keith! It's after nine. It's Dr. Reid now.
29650	Keith	Dr. Reid. Dr. Reid.
29651	Elliot	I love booty calls. Ha!
29652	J.D.	"El Toro Grande?" I'm not familiar with this brand.
29653	J.D.	No change. Her FiO2 is still 50%.
29654	Elliot	I said no cream.
29655	Elliot	I didn't say no cream. It's like having a sex puppy. What's your problem?
29656	J.D.	I gotta tell you, I can't stand that guy.
29657	Elliot	J.D., he's just a booty call. Say the word and I'll end it.
29658	J.D.	I'd appreciate it if you did.
29659	Elliot	Oh, my God, you've turned Keith into forbidden fruit. I must have him now!
29660	Elliot	Heel! Kk-kk-kk.
29661	Janitor	Oh, hey, bud. Check out my new mop bling. Bling!
29662	Janitor	It's cool. Cleaned it.
29663	Dr. Cox	Oh, so now we're pals again? I gotta be honest with you, I'm a little confused there, Sasquatch.
29664	Janitor	I got a rep to protect, OK? I'm sort of seen as the king of the working folk. If they catch me hob-nobbing with a doctor-type, well, suffice it to say I won't get my cut of all the prosthetics we looted from the storage room.
29665	Dr. Cox	How's that?
29666	Janitor	We sell the feet to college kids for $500 a pop. Apparently, they smoke something out of them.
29667	Dr. Cox	Let me get this straight. You are embarrassed to be seen with me?
29668	Janitor	At the hospital. At the bar, we can hang out all we want.
29669	Janitor	You rich, yacht-owning punk! You think they're gone. It's cool. See you at the bar.
29670	Jordan	Aww, sweetie. Do you want me to call his mommy and tell her he's being mean to you? My fwiend is mean to me, wah!
29671	Turk	Listen. Honey, I know you're angry. But look what I found in my locker: a wad of cash. Now you can buy those shoes you always wanted.
29672	Carla	I'm not mad about that gym thing. Sign this, please?
29673	Turk	Any of you ladies have a pen?
29674	Carla	Woo!
29675	Turk	Whoa! Yow! YOW!
29676	Carla	Ah.
29677	Turk	You set me up! Baby, you are mad. Look, it's not a crime for me to want to have one place that I can hang out by myself.
29678	Carla	Turk, I am not mad, OK? Now staple these please.
29679	Turk	Anybody got a stapl
29680	Turk	Hey! Hey.
29681	J.D.'s Narration	I promised myself I would pick on Keith, but this one he had coming.
29682	J.D	OK, guys, gather round, gather round. Your hero, Keith, here forgot to check the blood levels on Mr. Joy this morning. And guess what? He's dead. Way to go, there, Keith.
29683	Keith	I've never even seen this guy before.
29684	J.D.	Oh, way to get to know your patients, there, murderer.
29685	Doug	There's Mr. Joy. J.D., did you steal him from the morgue?
29686	J.D.	Doug, I left a note on the decapitated guy's stump that I would have him back by two. It is 1:45.
29687	Doug	Now I have to take him back down to the basement and I don't even have my gurney. I hate dead people.
29688	J.D.	All right, the real reason I brought Mr. Joy up here was for a teaching exercise. Can anyone figure out what the cause of death may have been?
29689	Keith	Maybe when you leaned over to check his IV, you smothered him with one of your love handles.
29690	J.D.	What did you say Keith?
29691	Keith	Dr. Reid told me that if you picked on me, I should stand up for myself. And that you're very sensitive about your doughy physique.
29692	J.D.	Well, I'm not.
29693	Doug	Please, no one help. He's not heavy at all.
29694	J.D.	You know, Keith, I think out of professional decorum, we should refrain from talking about Dr. Reid. He's boinking her, everyone. That's why he gets special treatment. What did she say to do if I said that?
29695	Keith	Page her.
29696	Elliot	Hello.
29697	J.D.	Ack. I forgot how strong you are when you're mad.
29698	Dr. Cox	Hey, uh, can I talk to you for a second?
29699	Janitor	What's the matter, Sally? The vending machine is out of bras again?
29700	Worker	Nice, you tell him.
29701	Janitor	What's up, buddy?
29702	Dr. Cox	Well, nothing really, I just thought your friends over there might be interested in seeing this photo of us I took with my cell phone the other night.
29703	Dr. Cox	I'm going to airbrush "friends forever" on it and then I'm going to hang these bad boys all over the hospital.
29704	Dr. Cox	Oh, evocative.
29705	Janitor	Give it to me.
29706	Dr. Cox	You want it? Come and get it. Come on, get it!
29707	Dr. Kelso	Gentlemen, let's try to be professional.
29708	Doug	I left my gurney downstairs in the morgue.
29709	Dr. Kelso	You're a superstar.
29710	Turk	Ain't nobody in this state gonna kill me, woman.
29711	Carla	Well, you know what bothers me? You whining about me being in your space when you're the one who never wants to be alone. I mean for God's sake...
29712	J.D.	Doughy physique, Elliot? Doughy physique?
29713	Elliot	Well, if the pear-shaped shirt fits, wear it!
29714	J.D.	I am ashamed of you, OK, do you know petty it is to get that personal?
29715	J.D.	Once, when we were dating, Elliot asked me to urinate on her.
29716	Elliot	Dammit, I had been stung by a jellyfish!
29717	J.D.'s Narration	Around here it can feel like good things never happen.
29718	Dr. Cox	Good to see you, you old bird.
29719	Mrs. Wilk	did I miss anything?
29720	J.D.	I'll catch you up later.
29721	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, when they do, all the petty little arguments fade away.
29722	J.D.'s Narration	And you don't mind waiting a little longer for your workout...
29723	J.D.'s Narration	...Or your bar friend not being your work friend.
29724	J.D.'s Narration	Because the truth is, when you put stuff into perspective, the little things will never bother you again.
29725	Keith	Good morning, Dr. D. Dr. Reid told me to get my sweet ass out of the shower and make her an omelet. You want one?
29726	J.D.'s Thoughts	Did I say never?
29727	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
29728	Open	J.D.'s Bedroom. J.D. is asleep.
29729	J.D.'s Narration	The worst thing about Elliot having picked my annoying intern, Keith, as her permanent booty call is that if he's had a few beers, he sometimes forgets which room is hers.
29730	Keith	I'm here, lover.
29731	J.D.	Tender.
29732	J.D.	In my defense, Keith's a decent kisser and anyone waking up that way would let out a pleasure moan.
29733	Turk	Same thing happened to me in college.
29734	J.D.	Really? What guy drunkenly kissed you while you were sleeping?
29735	J.D.'s Narration	And it was at that moment that Turk and I remembered the incident we managed to block out for 12 years.
29736	Turk	Uh, you OK with us not hanging out for a couple of weeks?
29737	J.D.	Totally.
29738	Turk	OK.
29739	J.D.'s Narration	I was going to miss Turk but luckily, my favorite intern was around to cheer me up: Jason Cabbagio. Or as I had brilliantly nicknamed him...
29740	J.D.	Cabbage!
29741	Jason & Mark	Yes, sir?
29742	J.D.	Oh, no Mark, I wasn't talking to you. I was talking to Cabbage.
29743	Mark	Well, my last name is Cabbage.
29744	J.D.	I know that, but I've nicknamed you "Wolfman" because of your keen sense of smell.
29745	J.D.'s Thoughts	And your ridiculously hairy torso.
29746	J.D.	Now, what can I do you for?
29747	Jason	Dr. D, is the IV supposed to leak like this?
29748	J.D.	Well, yes and no, mostly no, really - really, all no. But don't worry, I got your back. First thing is, take a little nipper yourself.
29749	J.D.	Oh, got some on you, look out! OK, that's some of the fun that you can have, but no , seriously watch and learn, watch and learn.
29750	Jason	It's an honor to watch you work, sir.
29751	J.D.	Take it all in, Cabbage, take it all in.
29752	J.D.'s Narration	Yes, I like some interns more than others, but I never let my personal feelings affect my professional behavior.
29753	J.D.	You're late, Keith! Which doesn't surprise me because you're a bad person.
29754	Keith	Sir, they needed help with a shooting victim downstairs.
29755	J.D.	Lies will get you nowhere, Keith.
29756	Keith	I'm covered in his blood.
29757	J.D.	That could be anyone's blood.
29758	Carla	Here's the gunshot victim from downstairs.
29759	Gunshot Victim	Hey, look! My blood.
29760	J.D.	That's not your blood.
29761	Gunshot Victim	Yes it is.
29762	J.D.	Quiet time.
29763	Turk	All right, listen. If Mr. Burton wants the surgery, you just call me on my celly.
29764	Elliot	Cool, what's your number?
29765	Turk	You have my number.
29766	Elliot	I don't, I changed phones.
29767	Turk	Oh. But you didn't switch out the old numbers into the new phone?
29768	Elliot	Yeah, but I decided just to put a couple of emergency numbers on here...
29769	Turk	"The Butterball Turkey help line." This one just says "That guy in the restaurant."
29770	Elliot	Hey, I really clicked with "that guy in the restaurant," OK? We spent all night talking about...something, OK? Look, Turk, if I need you I can just call Carla. It's not like we hang out just the two of us anymore. I bet you don't have my number in your cell.
29771	J.D.'s Narration	Not even Keith could bum me out because everyone's favorite patient, Mrs. Wilk, is going going home today.
29772	Mrs. Wilk	I'm sure not going to miss this food.
29773	Carla	Well, the nurses and I got you this.
29774	Carla	Huh?
29775	Mrs. Wilk	Ohh!
29776	Carla	You should see the size of the stationery store.
29777	J.D.'s Narration	That was a huge courtesy laugh, because I was about to trump Carla's goodbye gift like nobody's business.
29778	J.D.	Mrs. Wilk, I remembered how much you like basketball, so I got you a DVD of the NBA's "All Time Greatest Centers of All Time" signed by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
29779	Mrs. Wilk	Oh, J.D., this is so sweet.
29780	J.D.'s Thoughts	Winner!
29781	Keith	My gift is in the same vein.
29782	J.D.	Oh, is it, Keith?
29783	Keith	Mr. Abdul-Jabbar is on my dad's flag football team.
29784	Kareem Abdul-Jabbar	Hi, Patricia.
29785	Mrs. Wilk	Oh!
29786	Kareem Abdul-Jabbar	That's not my signature. Did you sign this? It's illegal.
29787	J.D.	OK. Back to the psych ward, Mr. Rosenberg. Crazy.

29789	Open	Admissions Area:
29790	J.D.'s Narration	That morning seemed like any other. Dr. Mickhead was back, having beaten the rap on murdering his spouse.
29791	Dr. Mickhead	Anyone want a cool prison jumpsuit?
29792	J.D.'s Narration	Dr. Kelso was having his daily staring contest with the last double chocolate chocolate-chip muffin.
29793	Dr. Kelso	Let's end this charade. You win again. You always do.
29794	Dr. Kelso	Would someone explain what that bird is doing in my hospital?
29795	Janitor	Sanchez appears to be flying, sir. I've named him Sanchez. He set up shop in that old wreath, there. I'd take it down, but the patients around here really seem to love the little guy.
29796	Dr. Kelso	That disease-infested scavenger is a serious health risk!
29797	Janitor	Oh.
29798	Dr. Kelso	do you know the number one cause of death in the hospital?
29799	Dr. Cox	Your breath?
29800	Dr. Kelso	Infection. And do you know how quickly infection spreads in a hospital?
29801	Dr. Cox	Your breath.
29802	Dr. Kelso	That doesn't make sense.
29803	Dr. Cox	Hmm. Don't care.
29804	Dr. Kelso	Look. Infection can start with a simple sneeze...
29805	Dr. Kelso	...and then a handshake...
29806	Dr. Kelso	...perhaps an accidental collision...
29807	Dr. Kelso	...then a simple touch on the shoulder.
29808	Dr. Kelso	And just like that, you have a patient in trouble.
29809	Todd	Chinatown is awesome.
29810	Dr. Kelso	I want that bird gone.
29811	J.D.	Keith, I realize you'd like to be at your grandmother's funeral on Saturday, heck, we all would. But you can't just take a day off whenever you feel like it.
29812	Keith	Then how come Cabbage got Saturday off so he could go see King Kong?
29813	J.D.	Because, Keith, Cabbage is an ape enthusiast. Show him a little.
29814	J.D.	It's like I'm at the zoo. Put the thing in your mouth, when you...
29815	J.D.	Yeah!
29816	Turk	See you, Mrs. Wilk.
29817	Mrs. Wilk	I'm gonna miss you.
29818	Elliot	I'm going to miss our late night talks.
29819	Mrs. Wilk	You can call me any time you want, sweetie.
29820	Elliot	Got you number right here on my phone. Sorry.
29821	Turk	Don't even worry about it. It's OK.
29822	Turk	We are so not cool.
29823	Elliot	We're not? Why are you making such a big deal out of this? It was a simple...
29824	Turk	LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA...
29825	Turk & Elliot	Mr. Burton, hey!
29826	Elliot	Now, in a few minutes, I'm be coming get you for your aortic bi-fem bypass surgery.
29827	Turk	And if there's anything we can do for you, just let us know.
29828	Mr. Burton	Well, if I don't make it, I want you to make sure my sons gets this note.
29829	Turk & Elliot	Done.
29830	Janitor	Oh-ho-ho, I can't believe you fell for that. Why would that call have been for you? It's my cell phone. Do you have my one button?
29831	Janitor	Hey! Now I can't call my buddies in Saigon. Touché. What else can you do?
29832	J.D.	Hey, can I borrow five bucks? I left my wallet at home.
29833	Dr. Cox	Whaddaya need five dollars for, because Abraham
29834	Carla	Because Abraham Lincoln is your latest president crush, or because Woolworth is having a 48 hour girdle sale? There, I did for you, don't talk with your mouthful.
29835	Carla	Here, all I have are hundreds.
29836	Carla	Because I worked the streets last night, apparently I'm a prostitute.
29837	Dr. Cox	OK!
29838	Carla	Thanks.
29839	J.D.	Thank you.
29840	Janitor	Nice job, buddy. Let's go get you that hat.
29841	Janitor	Mine.
29842	Carla	Where's my change?
29843	J.D.	A bird took it.
29844	Carla	I want it back by tonight, or I'm going to beat it out of you.
29845	Dr. Cox	Why are you sitting here, Newbie?
29846	J.D.	I'd sit with my interns, but Keith's over there and I can't stand him.
29847	Dr. Cox	I've seen that kid. Horrible doctor. I would sooner leave my medical care in the hands of Dr. Acula. Yes, I read your screenplay and as much as it pains me to say it, I didn't hate it. All right, lookit, here's what you gotta do with this Keith. You turn the heat up on his ass, and sooner or later he'll make a mistake and then you bounce him the hell out of here.
29848	J.D.	What did you think of the Transylvania dream sequence? Because I wrote it while I was on call, and the next morning I woke up and read it and I was like "what was I thinking," you know?
29849	Dr. Cox	Bethany. Focus.
29850	J.D.	Well, I can't just pick one of them out to torture.
29851	Dr. Cox	Then dump on all of them. I'm sure they deserve it, I mean let's face the facts. You are their teacher, how competent can they be?
29852	J.D.	Actually, just this morning, one of them had trouble with an IV. Yesterday, one of them made a diagnosis off a backwards X-ray, and last week one of them make a patient septic when he confused a suppository with a Mike & Ike.
29853	Dr. Cox	Stellar group there, Newbie, let the torturing commence.
29854	Dr. Cox	Oh, I'm sorry, that means conversational time is o-v-e-r. Please exit the area. Please exit the area. Please exit the area.
29855	J.D.	When you get a chance, I'd love to talk to you more about the screenplay.
29856	Dr. Cox	Please exit the area. Please exit the area. Please exit the area.
29857	J.D.'s Narration	Turk and Elliot were having a hard time, too, because their patient, Mr. Burton, didn't make it through surgery.
29858	Turk	We did everything we could for your dad.
29859	Elliot	We are so sorry, Devin, Eric.
29860	Eric	That's Devin, I'm Eric.
29861	Elliot	Oh. You guys must get that all the time.
29862	Devin	Why, because all black people look the same?
29863	Elliot	God, no, because you're identical twins.
29864	Devin	Is she always this racist?
29865	Turk	Oh, there's a pattern.
29866	Elliot	Identical twins, Turk!
29867	J.D.	Uh- oh, Keith. It looks like someone's gone prematurely gray. That's gonna hurt with the ladies.
29868	Carla	Wow. You know, Dr. Cox told me you were getting tough on your interns. I had no idea you were gonna go all cotton ball on their asses.
29869	J.D.	I think I know how to deal with people, Carla. Check this. Cabbage, heat test!
29870	Jason	It's a little hot.
29871	J.D.	I'll add some milk. Thank you. See?
29872	Carla	Yeah.
29873	J.D.'s Thoughts	And now, it's goodbye, Keith.
29874	J.D.	Interns, gather! The next intern who screws up is going to be suspended for two weeks! This is a list of all of your names. At least the ones I remember. At the end of each day, I will either write a smiley face or a sad face next to your name. One sad face and you are gonzo, and I want to warn you, I write my sad faces pretty darn sad. Allow me to demonstrate. Dr. Cox, may I borrow your pen?
29875	Dr. Cox	Not going to happen. I had to strangle a nurse to get this clicky-top.
29876	J.D.	Please? I'm in the middle of a very threatening speech.
29877	Dr. Cox	Return this pen or die painfully.
29878	J.D.	Thank you. So as I was saying, my sad faces...
29879	J.D.'s Narration	Around here, it can be pretty tough to hang onto things. So if someone's trying to take your new friend away, you might have to lie.
29880	Janitor	The bird's dead, sir. And if you're wondering, Sanchez tasted like chicken. I ate him.
29881	Dr. Kelso	I get it. Now would you sign this order form so I can stop talking to you?
29882	Janitor	Gracias.
29883	Dr. Kelso	De nada.
29884	Eric	You said our father left us a note?
29885	Elliot	Yeah. Dr. Turk, give it to them.
29886	Turk	Elliot, I gave it to you, you have the note, you give it to them.
29887	J.D.'s Narration	And if you feel your credibility slipping, you might have to excuse yourself for a moment.
29888	Elliot	Excuse us for one minute, there, Devin, Eric, um. Hmm..
29889	J.D.	Anyway, I know it's in pencil, but that's what a sad, two-week suspension face would look like, all right? Very, very sad. Yes?
29890	J.D.	Who tried to give Mrs. Meadows an ACE inhibitor? She's six months pregnant, she could have lost the baby.
29891	J.D.'s Narration	Of course, sometimes there's nothing you can do.
29892	Jason	That was me, sir. Sorry.
29893	J.D.	Oh, Cabbage. Not you, Wolfman. Ugh.

29895	Open	Mrs. Wilk's room.)
29896	Dr. Cox	I uh, I can't believe you're finally getting out of this deathtrap. I mean the odds were against you. You had a life threatening disease, life threatening doctor...
29897	Dr. Cox	Anyway, it was a pleasure treating you, and...
29898	Mrs. Wilk	I know how hard it is for you to say something nice, so you can go.
29899	Dr. Cox	Thanks.
29900	Dr. Cox	Why the grim face, there, Trish? Watching Dr. Kelso's afternoon staring contest with the last brownie?
29901	Dr. Kelso	You bested me again, you little chocolate bitch.
29902	J.D.	Nah, I'm just kind of sad about my intern.
29903	Dr. Cox	Why? You got what you wanted, you drove Keith out of here.
29904	J.D.	No, I drove Cabbage out. That's Keith.
29905	Dr. Cox	That's Keith? That kid's the best intern we've got. Hell, I'd like to bronze him and turn my office into a Keith-edral and convert to Keith-stianity. F.Y.I., I still want my pen back.
29906	J.D.	Oh, I don't have it.
29907	Dr. Cox	You damn sure better find it, Newbie, and when you do, I want it buffed, shined and de-nerdified.
29908	Dr. Cox	You think that's funny? This isn't over.
29909	J.D.	What's not over?
29910	J.D.	Do you know what's not over?
29911	Elliot	You are making such a big deal about this. Turk, I did not lose it, you did.
29912	Turk	I don't lose things.
29913	Carla	Please, you lose everything. Sometimes I worry what you'll be like as a dad.
29914	Turk	Yeah, baby, we're on our way back now. Junior and I just went to go pick up a pumpkin.
29915	Turk	I'm gonna have to call you back.
29916	Woman	Look, somebody left a baby here.
29917	Carla	Well, he is kind of cute.
29918	Turk	Phew.
29919	Turk	Our baby's first bath.
29920	Carla	Oh, watch the head.
29921	Carla	What?!
29922	Turk	OHHHHHHH!
29923	Carla	Come on, that was intentional!
29924	Turk	Charge the mound, son!
29925	Turk & Carla	Charge the mound!
29926	Turk	We're so damn proud of you, son.
29927	Carla	That's my little valedictorian.
29928	Turk	Ha ha.
29929	Carla	No!
29930	Turk	Put him back together, baby!
29931	Carla	No!!
29932	Son	Mom? Dad?!
29933	Carla	Son? Son?
29934	Turk	Get over here, boy! You come over here and give your father a hug!
29935	Turk	NOOOOOO!!!!
29936	Turk	Dude, you all right? You were gone for a really long time.
29937	J.D.	You're gonna be an awful father!
29938	J.D.'s Thoughts	And now, to take care of my boy.
29939	J.D.	Cabbage is back! Gang, I should have made it clear, earlier. The suspension policy begins today at 4PM. So, my apologies to Cabbage.
29940	Jason	That's OK, Dr. D.
29941	J.D.	You get in there!
29942	Keith	This is totally unfair! If I had messed up, I'd be gone.
29943	J.D.	Let me explain something to you, Keith, OK? I treat each and every one of you like unique individuals, OK? Take Gloria, for example, she's 400 years old. She needs to sleep a lot. I work around that schedule.
29944	J.D.	Wolfman has gotta be home by daybeak, so he does all of his work come nightfall. Crazy Barry. Not allowed near children. We work around that.
29945	Keith	How come I don't get a nickname?
29946	J.D.	Not everyone's last name lends itself to a nickname, Keith.
29947	Keith	My last name is Dudemeister.
29948	J.D.	And what am I supposed to do with that? OK, I'm not a magician.
29949	Dr. Kelso	Patricia, it's been a real pleasure having you at Sacred Heart. And I certainly hope the next time you fall ill, you'll remember us. I'm...not implying that you'll get ill, it's just that you're old and chances are good stop talking, Robert.
29950	Mrs. Wilk	It's all right, I knew what you meant.
29951	Janitor	Dammit, Sanchez, I told you, Dorian's in room 136. This is...
29952	Dr. Cox	Hey, Newbie!
29953	Dr. Cox	Watch out for the bedpan. Now we're even. But answer me this one question, will you please?
29954	J.D.	Those are beautiful antlers.
29955	Dr. Cox	Ruh? Why is that screw-up still here?
29956	J.D.	You see, Dr. Cox, I treat each and every one of my interns differenly...
29957	Dr. Cox	And, you're done. So, you accidentally drummed your friend out of here because you were trying to eighty-six the Dudemeister, eh?
29958	J.D.	that nickname will never stick. It's too long.
29959	Dr. Cox	Listen carefully, Newbie. Things happen for a reason. Do me a favor and think back on all those mistakes your interns made and tell me this: who made them?
29960	Jason	Hey. Dr. D, is the IV supposed to leak like this?
29961	Jason	I'm not quite sure what I'm looking at here.
29962	Jason	Don't worry. You're going to feel much better after I insert this suppository.
29963	J.D.	I don't remember who made those mistakes.
29964	Dr. Cox	Yeah, you do.
29965	J.D.'s Thoughts	OK, this sucks. But at least I didn't forge a note from a dead father.
29966	Turk	Are you guys ready? All right, Elliot, begin.
29967	Elliot	My dearest Eric, it is my wish for you that you finally find a good woman...
29968	Eric	I'm gay.
29969	Elliot	...so that she might find you a man...
29970	Eric	Dad didn't know I was gay.
29971	Elliot	...so that he might find you a woman.
29972	Janitor	I found your note inside Sanchez's wreath. I also found a bunch of little furniture. I don't know where he got that, he sure as hell didn't make it. He didn't have the time.
29973	Devin	Make sure you clean out the gutters at the lake house so the porch doesn't flood?
29974	Turk	Ours is better than that.
29975	Janitor	Well, it's done. I had him stuffed.
29976	Dr. Kelso	Terrific.
29977	Janitor	And, he's gone. Wow, that was impressive, my friend. You're free to fly.
29978	Janitor	Farewell, Sanchez. Tienes mi corazón! Tienes mi corazón.
29979	J.D.'s Thoughts	Time to give Keith, here, a little treat.
29980	J.D.	Hey, Todd. My buddy, Keith, here, says you're no good at rat-tailing.
29981	Todd	Oh, really?
29982	J.D.	Oh!
29983	Todd	Yeah! There! Tell him I'm good!
29984	J.D.	Oh, he's good, Keith. Really good.
29985	Keith	Thanks for the warning.
29986	Jason	Hey, Dr. Dorian.
29987	J.D.	Hey, Jason, uh, we need to talk. Look, you're you're not progressing as fast as the other interns, and you've been making a lot of mistakes lately.
29988	Jason	I know what you're going to say. I really am suspended for two weeks. But I promise, I'll do much better when I come back.
29989	J.D.	Yeah, about coming back...
29990	J.D.'s Narration	Dr. Cox was right. Things do happen for a reason.
29991	J.D.'s Narration	Like how going through a horrible experience with a friend can remind you how much you missed hanging out together.
29992	Turk	"A woman, to find a man, to find a woman."
29993	Elliot	Excuse me for a sec.
29994	Turk	"Incoming call from Elliot Reid?"
29995	Elliot	You're on speed dial, baby.
29996	Turk	Ah!
29997	Turk	Wazzup?
29998	Elliot	Wazzup?
29999	Turk	What you doin'?
30000	J.D.'s Narration	And in Cabbage's case, as much as I was gonna miss him, I was just lucky to get rid of him before he rally hurt someone.
30001	Jason	You've always been really nice to me and I just wanted to say thanks. And, goodbye.
30002	Mrs. Wilk	Oh, goodbye, young man.
30003	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
30004	Open	Elliot's apartment. Elliot is wearing a black dress with a turquoise sash. Keith is shirtless, and his hands are bound.
30005	J.D.'s Narration	Lately, Elliot and her booty call, Keith, loved playing games. Tonight it was the orchard owner and the Mexican apple thief.
30006	Elliot	Confess, Manuel! Confess that you stole these apples.
30007	Keith	I was at the dance, with the other pickers.
30008	Elliot	Liar!
30009	J.D.'s Narration	Frankly, the whole thing disgusted me.
30010	Elliot	You saw him do it, didn't you, Paco?
30011	J.D.'s Narration	Mostly, because they never let me speak.
30012	J.D.	He hid them in his pantalones. He loves these apples. He makes apples pie, and apples juice with them.
30013	Elliot	Paco, you can't talk because you lost your tongue in that cider press accident last year, remember? Now back to the pickers' bunkhouse!
30014	J.D.	I hate the pickers' bunkhouse.
30015	J.D.'s Narration	And I hate Keith. Which begs the question: why do I insist on being a part of their foreplay?
30016	J.D.'s Narration	I guess I needed a distraction because last week we all thought Mrs. Wilk was going home, but she got an infection. Despite our best efforts, she was now going to die. To make her happy, we decided to take her to the beach.
30017	Mrs. Wilk	I'm going to miss the feel of sand between my toes.
30018	J.D.'s Narration	Still, she was sick, so we couldn't go far.
30019	J.D.	Want me to bury you?
30020	Dr. Cox	Aw, shut up and move the Sunbrella, will you? I'm freckling.
30021	J.D.	I thought we had more sand.)
30022	Ted	Now what?
30023	Radio Announcer	OK, people, it's for our $50,000 cash draw. Today's lucky listener: Ted Buckland!
30024	Ted	What?
30025	Dr. Cox	Would you love a virgin daiquiri? It's a normal daiquiri, I just let him give it to you.
30026	Mrs. Wilk	Thanks! Cheers. You know, I've never really been afraid of death. I used it as a motivator. When you know there's an end, it forces you to live. It forced me in the eighth grade to ask Peter Bucharelli to take me to the sock hop. It made me dare to travel the world. It made me who I am. Still, now that I'm actually staring it in the eye, I why am I so scared?
30027	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes life sucks.
30028	Radio Announcer	Sorry, Ted, apparently you don't need the money!
30029	Ted	NOOOOOOO! Why?
30030	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
30031	Open	Cut to Mrs. Wilk's room.
30032	J.D.'s Narration	Mrs. Wilk decided to call the hospital grief counselor. He had a certain frankness about death.
30033	Dr. Hedrick	So, which one of you is gonna kick it? No, don't tell me, I want to guess. Uhh, I'm thinking it's either you, or you. No, you, because you're hooked up to a bunch of machines, or you, well you just have that look of someone who's gonna die young. I'm kidding!
30034	J.D.	Oh.
30035	Dr. Hedrick	You're gonna live forever. Or not, I mean, what do I know, I'm not psychic.
30036	J.D.'s Narration	We did not like him.
30037	Mrs. Wilk	I think he's funny.
30038	Dr. Cox	She's delirious.
30039	Dr. Hedrick	Mrs. Wilk, I'm Dr. Hedrick. Now it sounds cliché, but you're going to go through what we call the five stages of grief, which are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and finally acceptance. Now, I assume that you two have already entered a conversation with Mrs. Wilk about what the process of dying is going to be like.
30040	Dr. Cox	We were doing it, right before you came in.
30041	Dr. Hedrick	Oh, well then I'm sorry, please continue.
30042	Dr. Cox	All right, we will. Newbie, go.
30043	J.D.	Oh, oh, uh, OK, yeah, um...OK, death is like a journey. Uh, a journey in a boat, and uh, then this giant light shines down on, on your "boat," and um, um, it carries you up to the heavens.
30044	Dr. Hedrick	That was the ending to Cocoon.
30045	J.D.	Take it away, Coxy.
30046	Elliot	Keith, keep moving, no talking. Hey, where's my wave, you little piece of meat?
30047	Carla	You know, Elliot, the four of us should go out to dinner.
30048	Turk	Honey, why are you so obsessed about going out with other couples? Didn't you learn your lesson last with our neighbors?
30049	Carla	Squirrel chili. Who knew? It's really good.
30050	Turk	I want to go home.
30051	Carla	Eat your soup.
30052	Turk	No.
30053	Turk	They're not even our neighbors. They live in the woods behind our apartment.
30054	Carla	And we would have been having brunch with them on Sunday if you could have choked down the tail.
30055	Elliot	Carla, I don't know about dinner, Keith is a booty call. I actually make it a point not to see him before midnight.
30056	Ted	Oh, good. The piles are getting smaller.
30057	Janitor	Good.
30058	Dr. Kelso	Oh, that reminds me, did you get that damn sand out of his office?
30059	Janitor	Yes, I did, and it cut my commute in half.
30060	Janitor	Good morning, loyal subjects! Enjoy your day in Janitoria! Labor until you tire! And then labor some more! Looks like rain. That could be a problem.
30061	Ted	Sir, can I have Sunday afternoon off?
30062	Dr. Kelso	Well, that depends. Is Baxter's dog run going to hose itself down?
30063	Ted	No...
30064	Dr. Kelso	Actually, it is, I rigged the hose to a timer. But I need you to clean out my gutters.
30065	Ted	But, sir, I'm doing a bike ride for charity.
30066	Dr. Kelso	Ted, the only thing I hate more than bikes are procedural cop shows. We get it. The pedophile did it. Be at my house at 2:30.
30067	Ted	Just once I I wish I could treat Dr. Kelso like he treats us.
30068	Janitor	With Kelso, you got no leverage.
30069	Ted	Leverage. Leverage?
30070	Janitor	You don't know what it means, do you?
30071	Ted	No...
30072	Dr. Hedrick	I understand you guys spend most of your time fighting death around here, so it's it's understandable that you're made uncomfortable by this. Now, if you'd like, I'm willing to counsel both of you.
30073	J.D.'s Narration	I was tempted to take him up on it, but then Dr. Cox said something.
30074	Dr. Cox	Listen up. We don't need any of your head-shrinking.
30075	J.D.'s Thoughts	"We?" He said "we." After all these years, he's finally made us a team!
30076	J.D.	Yeah, Hedrick! If it was up to us, we never even would have called you! We can handle death just fine! We might even be going into private practice together.
30077	Dr. Cox	What?
30078	J.D.'s Thoughts	Easy. Now is not the time to discuss the Dorian-Cox clinic, Much less the relocation to Jacksonville.
30079	Dr. Hedrick	Clearly, I'm pushing some buttons here.
30080	Dr. Cox	You couldn't push my buttons if you tried. In fact, I have no buttons. Please think of me as buttonless. All smooth, like GI-Joe's nether-regions, and by-the-by, this image is brought to you by my son, Jack, who has been yanking the pants off his toy soldiers and leaving them in provocative positions on my nightstand. It is just disturbing enough so that leaving the house, I'm cranky and less able to suffer fools. Which brings me back to you: the fool. I'm done suffering you, so go now. Go, go before you can write a book entitled "Help, A Large Doctor Is Beating My Ass: The Lester Hedrick Story."
30081	Dr. Hedrick	That was a mouthful. Anyway, if you need to talk, just give me a call.
30082	Dr. Cox	He seems strangely impervious to my threats. That annoys me.
30083	Carla	So basically, whenever you're in the mood, you just call Keith and he comes over and gives you some of that twenty-something nasty?
30084	Elliot	Watch me.
30085	Elliot	Got the machine. Keith, we're going to your place tonight because my room smells like apple vinegar, so put some clean sheets on the futon and turn all the pictures of your parents face down. Except for that one one of your dad in the Navy...helps me.
30086	Turk	How the hell does he put up with that crap?
30087	Carla	Turk, would you get my scarf out of the car please?
30088	Turk	I am making a point here, honey. No man should
30089	Carla	Turk, less point-making, more scarf-getting.
30090	Turk	'Sup, man, you need a ride?
30091	J.D.	Keep moving, C-Bear.
30092	J.D.'s Thoughts	I was hunting for bigger game.
30093	Dr. Cox	Hey. I thought you went home already.
30094	J.D.	Oh, I tried to, Perry, but I'm having some scooter trouble.
30095	Dr. Cox	Come on, I'll give you a ride. Let's go.
30096	Dr. Cox	Can you believe the huevos on that Hedrick? Holy cow, it's like we've never had a patient die on us before. Uh, I gotta put this bag in the trunk.
30097	J.D.'s Thoughts	I was in the Porsche. I had never made it into the Porsche. It smelled like German heaven. I wasn't gonna blow this opportunity. I had to be careful about every little
30098	J.D.	Hey, a root beer!
30099	Dr. Cox	Don't open that soda. It's been rolling around on the floor for months, it will explode.
30100	J.D.	Apparently you're not familiar with the John Dorian three tap method. Three taps and the foam goes bye-bye.
30101	J.D.	Works every time.
30102	J.D.	Oh. Ahhh! The quickest way to my house is to take Elm.
30103	Keith	Elliot, wait.
30104	Elliot	Oh, I'm sorry, am I looking at your dad too much? His eyes penetrate my soul.
30105	Keith	No. I just want to tell you how beautiful you look right now.
30106	Elliot	That is so sweet.
30107	Janitor	There's something I learned today. Wet sand plus dehumidifier equals cave in.
30108	Dr. Kelso	Is that Ted and bunch of damn bikers?
30109	Janitor	Why do you hate bikes so much, sir?
30110	Dr. Kelso's father	Son, Daddy's got to move on. And I just want you to know that since the car is in your mother's name, I wouldn't be able to leave the family forever if it weren't for your bike.
30111	Dr. Kelso	It's complicated. GET OFF THE ROAD!
30112	Ted	Not today, Bobby! Not today.
30113	Dr. Cox	Ohhh...
30114	Dr. Hedrick	I see we're growling at other human beings now.
30115	J.D.	How you feeling Mrs. Wilk?
30116	Mrs. Wilk	Oh, not great. I'm cold.
30117	Dr. Hedrick	She's been getting weaker.
30118	J.D.'s Narration	In a hospital, you spend most of your time just trying to hold on.
30119	J.D.'s Narration	Whether it's trying to hold on to your perception of a relationship...
30120	Elliot	Hey, that was fun last night, I'm glad you got my message.
30121	Keith	I didn't get any message.
30122	Elliot	Oh.
30123	Carla	Elliot, if he didn't get your message, that means he called you for sex and you went over and gave it to him!
30124	Turk	You're his booty call now.
30125	J.D.'s Narration	...or just trying to hold on the handlebars of your custom bicycle.
30126	Ted	Don't worry, Teddy, he'll turn.
30127	Dr. Kelso	Why'd you leave me Daddy?
30128	Janitor	Now we got leverage.
30129	J.D.'s Narration	Unfortunately, as a doctor you see your fair share of people who simply can't hold on any longer.
30130	J.D.	She's in multi-organ system dysfunction.
30131	Dr. Hedrick	She's OK. She's ready.
30132	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
30133	Open	Mrs. Wilk's room and ICU.
30134	J.D.'s Narration	Mrs. Wilk didn't have much time, so either Dr. Cox or I had to notify her next of kin. As physicians, we knew just how to do it.
30135	J.D.'s Narration	First one to drop tells her.
30136	Dr. Cox	Phew. Pretty strong there, newbie.
30137	J.D.'s Narration	I was not. But hopefully, the duct tape I used to connect my prosthetic arms was.
30138	J.D.	Ow.
30139	Dr. Cox	Oh, why are we still doing this, I've seen people in Mrs. Wilk's shape turn it around, right?
30140	J.D.	She could totally turn it around!
30141	Dr. Hedrick	Denial. Yeah, it's not uncommon for people close to the patient to also undergo the five stages of grief.
30142	Dr. Cox	It's not denial. She could rally.
30143	J.D.	Yeah, totally rally.
30144	Dr. Hedrick	Oh yeah. I mean, look at her, she could be in a vitamin commercial.
30145	Dr. Cox	How would you like to be in a broken jaw commercial?
30146	Dr. Hedrick	God help me. I don't care if it does kill me, I just love this fake sugar.
30147	Dr. Cox	If he keeps ignoring my threats I I'm gonna have to hit him.
30148	J.D.	The good news is it looks like he has a soft face.
30149	Patient	Are you done with my arms?
30150	J.D.	Coming to you, Mr. Johnson.
30151	Elliot	So? I was Keith's booty call last night. Whatever, it'll blow over.
30152	Carla	That's not good enough, Elliot! By letting Keith get the upper hand you've given Turk ideas. Look at him.
30153	Turk	Baby. I know you hate my cool walking stick, but I gotta be my own man. It's catching on!
30154	Turk	Yeah.
30155	Janitor	OK, Teddy. I got this baby flowing now. I dunno if that's good. You should sue Kelso. You have a serious tort on your hands.
30156	Ted	Tort?
30157	Janitor	Civil case. From the French avoir tort?
30158	Ted	Did you go to law school?
30159	Janitor	No, I was Ruth Bader Ginsberg's janitor for a while.
30160	Ted	Ruth Bader who?
30161	Dr. Kelso	Hey, there's my guy! I just came up to apologize for that little fender bender out there. So, would two floor seats to the WNBA All-Star game just make all of this go away, huh?
30162	Ted	Absolutely!
30163	Janitor	Uh, Ted is going to be wanting a little bit more than that, I'm afraid.
30164	Ted	I am?
30165	Ted	I am!
30166	J.D.'s Narration	Dr. Cox and I decided to give Hedrick a piece of our mind. Unfortunately, I had lost front seat privileges.
30167	J.D.	Yeah, you're right. Still a little sticky. Not yet ready for passengers.
30168	Dr. Cox	All right, Lester! We are having this out, right here, right now!
30169	Dr. Cox	Oh, for the love of God. What is this, some pansy, get-in-touch-with-my-feelings-because-my-mommy-didn't-love-me group?
30170	J.D.	Yeah, is that what it is?
30171	Dr. Hedrick	Actually, this is a support group for the terminally ill.
30172	J.D.	Oh, we should probably go.
30173	Dr. Hedrick	No, no, please continue.
30174	Dr. Cox	Stop bugging us. I find your particular brand of psycho-babblery about as useful as fairy dust.
30175	Patient	He's actually helped me quite a lot.
30176	Dr. Cox	Oh. Good.
30177	J.D.	Dr. Cox.
30178	Dr. Cox	Yeah, Newbie, what do you got?
30179	J.D.	That guy looks fantastic. What do you think he's dying of, a case of the handsomes?
30180	Dr. Cox	Ah, you know what, to hell with you, Hedrick!
30181	Dr. Hedrick	Group, can you tell me what stage of grief Dr. Cos is going through?
30182	Group	Anger.
30183	Dr. Hedrick	Anger, yes.
30184	Dr. Cox	YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE ME ANGRY!
30185	J.D.	Nor do you want to see I angry.
30186	J.D.	You better hope you don't make any mistakes.
30187	J.D.	It's awful.
30188	Dr. Cox	Uhng.
30189	Turk	All right, Carla's down there telling Elliot to ignore you so she can regain the power.
30190	Keith	Well, I don't really care.
30191	Turk	Well, you know, this isn't about you Keith. This is about men everywhere who've been abused and bullied by women! It's about me. Now when they walk by, you call her a different name.
30192	Keith	I won't do it.
30193	Carla	OK, here's how you get your power back from Keith. Totally ignore him.
30194	Elliot	Really?
30195	Carla	Yep.
30196	Turk	Hey, how you doing, Clare?
30197	Elliot	Did you did you just call me Clare?
30198	Keith	No, I would never call you
30199	Carla	Oh, snap!
30200	Keith	Elliot! That didn't even sound like me.
30201	Turk	I know, they hear what they want to hear. They hear what they want to hear.
30202	Dr. Cox	I tell you what. I'd do anything if it meant she'd pull through this.
30203	J.D.	Me too.
30204	Dr. Hedrick	Hey, that sounds like bargaining. That's the third stage. Oh, and by the way, I wasn't just hiding down there just so I could pop up and say that. I was I was plugging in my iPod. Oh, um.
30205	Dr. Cox	Ehh.
30206	J.D.'s Narration	We weren't the only ones at the bargaining stage.
30207	Dr. Kelso	Heh, heh, heh.
30208	Ted	Ohhhh!
30209	Ted	Ohhhhhh!!
30210	Dr. Kelso	Now, let's talk, Ted. Just you and me. No lawyers.
30211	Carla	OK. I know how you can regain control of Keith.
30212	Elliot	Carla, don't bother. That booty call thing was fun for a while, but I'm so sick and tired of being a cold, emotionless bastard.
30213	Dr. Cox	Don't ever get sick and tired of that, it is awesome being that.
30214	J.D.	We love it.
30215	Dr. Cox	No!
30216	J.D.	It's too much, I know.
30217	Carla	Well, you can always get another boy toy, right? Plus, every time you look at Keith you're gonna be reminded of all that no-strings-attached fun you had.
30218	Elliot	That's not what I'll remember.
30219	Keith	I just want to tell you how beautiful you look right now.
30220	Elliot	That is so sweet.
30221	Carla	Oh, Elliot! You like him!
30222	J.D.'s Narration	And that was the moment it got real for Elliot.
30223	J.D.'s Narration	And for Dr. Cox and me.
30224	Dr. Cox	Should be any minute now.
30225	J.D.'s Narration	We'd been there before when someone died. But this felt different.
30226	J.D.	She's gone.
30227	J.D.'s Narration	We were definitely in the depression stage. And bless Hedrick, he didn't say it. All he said was...
30228	Dr. Hedrick	She was lucky to have you two as doctors.
30229	J.D.'s Narration	Letting go is never easy.
30230	J.D.'s Narration	Whether it's letting go of the leverage you had over your boss...
30231	Janitor	Sir, I would like to have the word "maintenance" written on the back of my unis in tiny light bulbs. That way, when I'm on a break, I can turn it off, like a taxi.
30232	Dr. Kelso	Your friend settled. It's over.
30233	Ted	I got seven Sunday's off a year. YAY!
30234	J.D.'s Narration	...or letting go of your old booty call and making him your boyfriend.
30235	Elliot	Hey. You wanna go for dinner tonight? And I mean at seven, not midnight.
30236	Keith	I'd love that.
30237	J.D.'s Narration	But there's nothing more difficult than letting go of someone you cared about.
30238	Dr. Cox	She was a great old gal.
30239	J.D.	She was.
30240	Dr. Hedrick	Hey! Acceptance!
30241	Dr. Kelso	Damn bikes!
30242	Dr. Cox	Boy, sometimes you just gotta love Kelso.
30243	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
30244	Open	Half-Acre. Elliot and Keith are sunbathing. Elliot unclips her top and J.D. prepares to apply sunscreen.
30245	J.D.'s Narration	It was a beautiful day. So I invited Elliot over to my half-acre for some friendly sunbathing.
30246	J.D.'s Narration	Unfortunately, she brought Keith.
30247	Elliot	Oh, thanks for doing that, J.D., I do it myself, but the Bopsie twins are already loose.
30248	J.D.	Don't worry. It's not that homoerotic, is it?
30249	Keith	Oh, God, no.
30250	J.D.'s Narration	Keith didn't know I mildly disliked him. He also didn't know I was rubbing Crisco on his back.
30251	Keith	Does it smell like pie crust?
30252	J.D.	That's the rhododendron, Keith, everybody knows they smell like pie when they bloom.
30253	Elliot	Hey, nice new watch, J.D.
30254	J.D.	Thank you!
30255	J.D.'s Narration	It wasn't a watch. Now that Elliot had gotten serious with Keith, I needed to get tighter with Turk. And since he's so busy being married and trying to have a baby, I had only one option.
30256	J.D.	Come in, brown bear.
30257	J.D.'s Narration	I got us watchie-talkies
30258	Turk	Hey, white shadow.
30259	J.D.	That's not my handle.
30260	Turk	Hey, Gizmo.
30261	J.D.	Right on. Hey, what are you doing, man? I'm about to take out the slip and slide. Let's do it.
30262	Turk	Dude I can't.
30263	Turk	It's baby-making time. How's it going with Keith?
30264	J.D.	Awesome, check this.
30265	Turk	Bacon back! Classic!
30266	Carla	Hey stud, you ready to fertilize an egg?
30267	Turk	Gotta go. Maintain radio silence on all channels.
30268	J.D.'s Narration	A local magazine named Dr. Cox the best doctor in the city. Dr. Cox felt this was big news.
30269	Dr. Cox	All right. Here's how it's going to work, people. I'm going to ask each and every one of you just exactly who is the very finest physician in this city. To which you will respond: "You are!" If you do not reply in a timely and exuberant fashion, my associate here will take his mop, and these are his words, not mine, popsicle you.
30270	Dr. Cox	Now, my lovely ex-wife will demonstrate. Darling, just exactly who is the very best physician in our fair city?
30271	Jordan	You are. And now, as agreed, you owe me a night on the town and some me actually getting to finish sex.
30272	Dr. Cox	Well done. Now, down the line we go.
30273	Nurse	You are!
30274	Patient	You are!
30275	Nurse	You are!
30276	Laverne	You are!
30277	Lonnie	Yar!
30278	Lonnie	GOD! Why?
30279	Janitor	You combined "you" and "are," you said "yar." It made no sense.
30280	Dr. Cox	It's true, Lonnie. Everyone heard it. Poke him again.
30281	Lonnie	Dihh.
30282	Dr. Cox	Bob Kelso, will you be joining us?
30283	Dr. Kelso	Hmm? There was a line. I assumed it had something to do with cupcakes.
30284	Dr. Cox	Bob, obviously you read the article.
30285	Dr. Kelso	Perry, the last publication I read was the issue of "Out" my son left by the crapper when he was home this weekend asking for money. You'll never get my validation, hot shot.
30286	Dr. Cox	And just exactly where was the poke?
30287	Janitor	Mm. I froze. Give me another twenty bucks, I'll go crack him over the head.
30288	Dr. Cox	Eh, kill him if you have to.
30289	Turk	That was amazing baby. I've never felt so close to you.
30290	Carla	Oh, me too. Ahh. Turk?
30291	Turk	Were you not done cuddling honey? Because I was thinking we could go over to J.D's half-acre, put a blanket down, you can lie on my lap while I stroke your hair.
30292	Carla	Real reason, Turk.
30293	Turk	J.D. has a slip and slide and I want to show him some of my slammin' new moves. I call this "The Captain."
30294	Turk	Right? And there's this one: "The Dolphin."
30295	Carla	I swear Turk, sometimes I think you and J.D. are more of a couple than we are.
30296	J.D.	Tell her I've known you longer.
30297	Carla	Ugh.
30298	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
30299	Open	Nurses' Station. Keith is showing his sunburn to Elliot
30300	Keith	Yeah, I just don't usually burn this bad.
30301	Elliot	Ohh. Don't worry, later I'm going to find some aloe and rub it on wherever it hurts.
30302	Keith	Well, it's just on my back, really.
30303	Elliot	Keith, that was innuendo, you were going to work on this.
30304	Keith	Oh, right, right, right, right. OK, um, it also hurts under my pants in my pants. Dammit! I can't get this!
30305	Elliot	Sweetie, you'll get it. You'll get it.
30306	Elliot	What? Laverne, what?
30307	Laverne	No judgment here, child.
30308	J.D.'s Narration	People were starting to talk about Elliot and Keith. But I decided to stay above the fray. Then I changed my mind.
30309	J.D.	Can you believe those two?
30310	Laverne	No, I can't. All that carrying on in public.
30311	Nurse #1	It's way too much.
30312	J.D.	It's just too much. Sorry, I switched places so I could go again.
30313	Rex	Dr. Dorian?
30314	J.D.	Yes, Rex?
30315	Rex	Uh, Mrs. LeVinne won't take her medication.
30316	J.D.	Mrs. LeVinne has dementia, Rex, and I know she loves sweets. So take the pill, put it in some raspberry jam, put it on your finger, dip it in her mouth, helloo!
30317	J.D.'s Narration	Rex would forever remember that morning as the time he lost his fingertip. But with patients, it's luck of the draw. you can't choose how tolerant they are.
30318	Patient	Young man, can you make sure they don't give me any black blood?
30319	Turk	I'll try.
30320	J.D.'s Narration	You can't choose how classy they are.
30321	Carla	Oh, your hernia stitches look great, Mr. Borland.
30322	Mr. Borland	Could you give them a kiss?
30323	Carla	Maybe later.
30324	Dr. Cox	Hello.
30325	Patient	It's about time. Are you my doctor?
30326	Dr. Cox	Yes, I am. I'm gonna go ahead and give a second so you can think about how lucky that makes you.
30327	Patient	Don't try to be funny. Now here's a list of things I'm going to need you to take care of.
30328	Dr. Cox	That is so helpful. Let's take a look at this.
30329	Keith	Hey!
30330	Elliot	Hey, when are you coming over tonight?
30331	Keith	I can't, I'm on call. I'm really worried about a patient with metastatic adenocarcinoma.
30332	Elliot	Aww, see this is why I hate cancer.
30333	Dr. Cox	Listen up!
30334	Keith	You are!
30335	Dr. Cox	We're not doing that anymore. Now, you're fairly strong at diagnosing, right?
30336	Keith	Yes, sir.
30337	Dr. Cox	Terrific. I need to you to go upstairs and figure out what's wrong with that darn third-floor coffee machine. And Gandharoo, I need you to talk to a young pregnant black girl who will not let me call her mom.
30338	Turk	Why would she listen to me?
30339	Dr. Cox	I may have told her that you're Kanye West.
30340	Turk	I'm actually all right with that.
30341	Dr. Cox	Let's go, group.
30342	Elliot	They are three manly men.
30343	Jordan	Perry gets his chest waxed.
30344	Elliot	Keith likes to knit throw pillows.
30345	Carla	Turk might be sterile.
30346	Jordan	We have a winner.
30347	Carla	I can't get pregnant and I already got a fertility test.
30348	Elliot	So why don't you just ask him to get tested?
30349	Carla	Oh, Turk is very sensitive when it comes to his manliness. Remember when I told him his backpack looked like a purse?
30350	Carla	Turk, honey, I didn't mean it.
30351	Turk	I'm a man! And a man does not carry a purse! GAAAHHH!! AAAH!
30352	Carla	Yeah, ha ha ha, huh.
30353	Elliot	So, if you can't ask him to get tested, then what the hell are you going to do?
30354	Carla	That's easy. I'm gonna sperm-jack him.
30355	Elliot	All right, everyone, I've made a little tweak to the schedule. Uh, Lisa, you're on tonight and Keith is off because he's got some hospital-related business to tend to.
30356	Lisa	Agh-k-pbth.
30357	Elliot	Hey, don't give me that look, Lisa, you'd be off if you had a good reason.
30358	Lisa	Like if you and I were sleeping together?
30359	Elliot	First of all, the only woman in this hospital that I would even consider sleeping with is is Jamie in pediatrics, mmmm.
30360	Elliot	And, secondly, uh, I'm the attending. So tough tuckus.
30361	J.D.	Uh, wow.
30362	Lisa	It's just so unfair!
30363	Gloria	So unfair.
30364	J.D.	It really is unfair, you guys!
30365	Turk	Hey, Gizmo, can you check on Mr. Jensen for me?
30366	J.D.	No problem, brown bear. Are you nude right now?
30367	Turk	Yeah! How did you know?
30368	J.D.	Because your voice is always higher when you're nude.
30369	Turk	Ha ha ha! That's true!
30370	Dr. Cox	It's not weird that you know that at all.
30371	Patient	Uh, Bob, just a note about the tapioca, I'm much more partial to flan.
30372	Dr. Kelso	You're a flan fan? Fun to say, more fun to eat. Anyway, anything that you need, you just ask Dr. Cox. Perry, Bonnie here is an old friend.
30373	Dr. Cox	Can't say I'm shocked.
30374	Dr. Kelso	Take care of her.
30375	Dr. Cox	You can count on me, Bobboo.
30376	Dr. Cox	Here's the lowdown. In three hours my shift ends, at which point I will be leaving you and meeting with my ex-wife for a celebratory best doctor in the city date guaranteed to end in crazy hotel room sex. I'm thinking six-inch heels, a leather mask, and fishnet stockings. Who knows? She may even get dressed up. good news for you though, is that you have a simple case of hyper-calcemia. Any trained monkey can treat it. Let's see who that monkey's gonna be.
30377	Rex	Ooh, banana.
30378	Dr. Cox	Rex it is. Good night. You're in very capable nine-fingered hands.
30379	Turk	I don't know what's gotten into you, baby, but I am turned ON!
30380	Carla	OK, honey, this might feel a little weird, but I promise you, you will love it.
30381	Turk	Honey? How could you think I wouldn't notice this on my dangle?
30382	Carla	You were enjoying it until it started making that grinding noise.
30383	Turk	I know we're having a hard time getting pregnant. But sweetness, it could be you.
30384	Carla	I already got tested.
30385	Turk	Oh.
30386	Carla	Turk...
30387	Turk	I'm a man! And I can make babies!
30388	Dr. Cox	I'm not afraid to tell you, Jordan, I think it's going to be a hell of a night. I got us a penthouse.
30389	Jordan	Great! How much did that run you?
30390	Dr. Cox	Oh, about five bucks. I figure while I'm in the shower you can get yourself revved up.
30391	Jordan	Awesome.
30392	Dr. Cox	Aw, now what the hell, Mongo?
30393	Janitor	Sorry. I'm his man now.
30394	Dr. Kelso	Hello, Perry.
30395	Janitor	Now don't get me wrong. I hit him hard, twice. It just made him mad. That guy's got a skull like a mountain goat.
30396	Dr. Kelso	Perry, when I told you to treat Mrs. Cooke, I meant it. If I'd wanted to waste my breath I would have given my wife mouth-to-mouth when she went into cardiac arrest. She's OK, my mistress used to be a lifeguard. Now, get your ass back in there.
30397	Dr. Cox	I'm sorry, baby. It looks like we're gonna have to take a rain check.
30398	Jordan	No, you are.
30399	Janitor	Enjoy your evening, ma'am.
30400	Jordan	Thank you.
30401	Janitor	No can do.
30402	Elliot	Hey, we're gonna get going.
30403	Dr. Cox	No, no, no, no, there is no way that you get to spring your little boy toy here for a night of passionless passion while my ass is stuck here and Jordan is in a hotel somewhere whispering sweet nothings to a shower nozzle.
30404	Elliot	Aww uhh.
30405	J.D.	I'm gonna go hang out back here.
30406	Dr. Cox	I tell you what we're gonna do. We'll leave it up to your interns. Who here doesn't think that Barbie should abuse her power?
30407	Dr. Cox	Ah. There we go. Face-jock stays.
30408	J.D's Narration	It's a strange feeling when everyone is stuck in hell, and you're not.
30409	Turk	I might be sterile?
30410	Carla	Oh, honey, stay calm. Nobody knows but us.
30411	J.D.	You firing blanks, buddy?
30412	Turk	Ohhh....
30413	J.D.'s Narration	I was just glad to watch TV and for once, not be in a world of crap.
30414	Elliot	Why didn't you stand up for me?
30415	J.D.'s Narration	Or not.
30416	Elliot	Attendings switch schedules all the time, J.D. You switched last week and I totally defended you. You know what's really going on here? You don't like Keith. Go ahead, tell me I'm wrong.
30417	Elliot	Thanks, J.D. You're a great friend.
30418	Turk	At least you're not sterile.
30419	J.D.	Amen to that, C-Bear.
30420	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
30421	Open	Elliot's apartment - Kitchen.
30422	J.D.'s Narration	The next morning, I braced myself for Elliot's odd brand of revenge.
30423	J.D.'s Narration	And there it was.
30424	J.D.	Did you individually drain all my eggs?
30425	Elliot	Morning!
30426	J.D.	Fine, I'll just have an apple.
30427	Elliot	Oh, looking for this?
30428	J.D.	How did you do that?
30429	J.D.	I'm having a rough morning, Brown Bear, how you doing with your sterility?
30430	Turk	Uhh, can't talk about that right now, I'm in an elevator.
30431	J.D.	Not reading you, Brown Bear! I repeat, are you still sterile?
30432	Laverne	This is so juicy I feel dizzy.
30433	Turk	Stupid watchie-talkie.
30434	Laverne	I heard they're trying to have children, but they can't because he
30435	Carla	Don't worry, baby. I'll kick her ass for you later.
30436	Turk	Mmm.
30437	Carla	We can go to the fertility clinic after work.
30438	Turk	I can handle this thing by myself. Besides, when you went to get your fertility test you didn't take me.
30439	Carla	Are you sure?
30440	Turk	Yeah, yeah, besides, I've been giving the fellow some inspirational pep talks. Gotta want it, boys! There's no "I" in sperm!
30441	Elliot	Hey! You get a patient with elastic seizures!
30442	Keith	Awesome! Every intern wanted this case.
30443	Carla	Elliot! You're asking for trouble. Everybody's already talking.
30444	Jordan	Mmhmm.
30445	Elliot	Keith is the best intern. I mean he shouldn't be punished because he has to sleep with me.
30446	Jordan	Has to?
30447	Elliot	Ge gets to. He gets to sleep with me. As a woman, have you ever noticed how old self-esteem issues sort of creep up on you?
30448	Carla	I have sausage fingers.
30449	Jordan	Do you remember wen I pulled strings with the board and got Perry that promotion?
30450	Elliot	Yeah.
30451	Jordan	People started talking. And Perry got totally emasculated. So it worked out great for me.
30452	Elliot	I should not care what other people think. Right, Carla? Oh, sweetie, they're beautiful!
30453	Carla	They're kielbasas.
30454	J.D.	Come in, Brown Bear, come in Brown Bear. If you're around, I'm having some java out front.
30455	Janitor	Huah!
30456	J.D.	Waah! I'm hit! I'm hit!
30457	Janitor	Haa! Oh, this is gonna be fantastic.
30458	Turk	All right, look. I know I said I wanted to go by myself to get tested today, but I've been doing some thinking and I'm scared. So, it'd mean a lot if you went with me.
30459	J.D.	Of course, buddy.
30460	Turk	You know I'm not comfortable getting busy with myself.
30461	J.D.	Well, you're in luck. This happens to be my specialty. Here's some tips. If you can't get over the fact that you're doing it to yourself, sit on your arm until it falls asleep, then pull it out and use that. I call it "The Stranger."
30462	Turk	If I ever have kids you are never allowed to babysit.
30463	J.D.	I can't believe you're ready to have kids. We spend all day taking care of old people, washing them, cleaning them, why would you want to bring that home?
30464	Turk	J.D., we're talking about kids. Not going home to a house full of old folks.
30465	J.D.	All right, fellas, two quick announcements! First of all, whoever's been filling up my Tivo with JAG reruns, let's cut it out. Secondly, Harvey, no matter how drunk you get, I like to sleep alone.
30466	Harvey	But I like to snuggle.
30467	J.D.	That's your problem, buddy, I got my own thing.
30468	Nurse	OK, uh, Chris Turk?
30469	Turk	Yeah.
30470	Nurse	We're ready for you.
30471	J.D.	Excuse me, are any of the reading materials in there available for those of us out here?
30472	Janitor	Hey J.D., this is that black surgeon you always hang out with. Come on outside to the ramp dawg.
30473	Janitor	Any second. Any second, now.
30474	Mrs. Cooke	Oh, for God's sake, breathe through your nose. You sound like my bulldog.
30475	Dr. Cox	You know, as a doctor, I rarely root for the disease, but with you, I find myself cheering "Go, hyper-calcemia with underlying M.E.N. syndrome, Go, go go!"
30476	Mrs. Cooke	Do you drink out of the toilet? My bulldog drinks out of the toilet.
30477	Dr. Cox	God Almighty.
30478	Lisa	Dr. Reid. We think it is lame that you give Keith preferential treatment. We're filing a formal complaint with Dr. Kelso.
30479	Elliot	Oh, OK. Sure, you know what? You guys can tell Dr. Kelso whatever you want because all he's gonna hear are the facts. I'm sleeping with Keith, he gets his schedule shifted and he gets the most interesting cases.
30480	Elliot	Well, that's not gonna work because I don't have that much money, so...
30481	Turk	I just got in here!
30482	Turk	Baby, what are you doing here?
30483	Carla	I was home, thinking about my fertility test and how badly I wanted you to be there with me.
30484	Turk	Baby, I'm a man, and we're not that vulnerable.
30485	Carla	I don't really know why I didn't tell you about it. I guess I was just scared that if I got bad news, I'd be letting you down.
30486	Turk	I can see how you'd feel that way.
30487	Carla	Anyway, I thought I'd come over.
30488	Turk	Aww, thanks, sweetie. But you might want to go outside, because I'm about to fill - this - up.
30489	Carla	Why would I wait outside?
30490	Turk	That's what's up.
30491	Dr. Cox	You are more than welcome to have your goons take both of my thumbs and break them, Bob, but I am officially O-U-T out. I mean, come on. I don't even see how you can like that woman.
30492	Dr. Kelso	I don't. She was married to my best friend, Richard. He died a few years back. You know the deal with friends. If they love them, you have to love them whether you like it or not.
30493	J.D.	Dr. Kelso, do you really believe that? Or are you just saying that to look good? Ah, who am I kidding. You don't care what anybody thinks about you, do you? I gotta tell you though, you gave me some good advice about how to deal with Elliot. Gootchie, gootchie, gootchie goo!
30494	Dr. Kelso	Can I fire him?
30495	Dr. Cox	Sleep on it. Say, one more thing about Devil Lady in there. Why me?
30496	Dr. Kelso	I know it's a minor condition, Perry, but you know how things can turn.
30497	Dr. Cox	But, you wanted me in there because I'm the best, what, Bob?
30498	Dr. Kelso	No.
30499	Dr. Cox	Say it, or I'll go in there and tell her you're dying to be with her a lot more often.
30500	Dr. Cox	Beg pardon?
30501	Dr. Kelso	You're the best doctor.
30502	Dr. Cox	Thank you, Bob. Means a lot to me.
30503	Elliot	Listen, I know that everyone is very upset, but I really don't think that there's any need to bother Dr. Kelso, and uh...
30504	Lisa	It's too late, Dr. Reid.
30505	J.D.	You're right, Lisa, it is too late, because from now on, I'm going to be handing out all the case assignments. For instance, this cool case right here.
30506	J.D.	Should I give it to the most annoying intern? Because that would be you, Lisa. Or maybe I should give it to the most incompetent intern missing a finger, because that would be you Rex. Or maybe I should just give it to the best intern, which would be you, Keith.
30507	J.D.	Now if anyone wants to tell on me, to whomever they like, they can. Good day.
30508	J.D.	Here you go.
30509	Keith	Thanks again, Dr. D.
30510	J.D.	All right, if you like him, I like him.
30511	Turk	Hey! I'm not sterile!
30512	J.D.	Congratulations!
30513	Elliot	Turk's not sterile!
30514	J.D.'s Narration	My friends were all happy. And even though I felt like the fifth wheel, I could take solace in something.
30515	J.D.	Oh, hey, Turk. I forgot, I can't raid the freezer with you.
30516	J.D.	Be careful in there, they lock it up at three.
30517	Janitor	Mmm? Oh. Oh-ho ho. I'm gonna kill him.
30518	J.D.'s Narration	I had finally won one.
30519	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
30520	Open	The bar.
30521	J.D's Narration	Now that Elliot and Keith were serious, she started buying him gifts.
30522	Keith	Ooh. It's a mouth harp, awesome!
30523	J.D.'s Narration	Keith was shockingly good at pretending to like crappy presents, but you know what he was best at?
30524	J.D.	Keith, we need more popcorn. Yeah.
30525	J.D.'s Narration	Being girl bait.
30526	J.D.'s Narration	Here's how it goes down. Keith comes back. Elliot marks her territory so the girls know he's taken, and I just pick off one of the smaller, weaker ones that come by for a look-see.
30527	J.D.	I'm a doctor. I'm a land-owner. Burt Reynolds is my father. I love sports.
30528	J.D.	Keith, more popcorn.
30529	Elliot	See? That's how it works.
30530	Girl	You have the cutest hair!
30531	J.D.	These old rags?
30532	Dr. Marston	OK, OK, so you're both, um, fertile, yet you're still unable to conceive, so how often do you make love?
30533	Turk	Twice today.
30534	Carla	Actually it was three times. You were asleep for the last one.
30535	Turk	Oh, wow, that really happened?
30536	Carla	Mmhmm.
30537	Turk	Huh, I thought it was weird that you were in one of my sex dreams.
30538	Carla	He is not allowed to dream about me. It gets too freaky in there.
30539	Turk	Cirque du Soleil freaky. One time, she was skinless.
30540	Dr. Marston	OK, stress is often a factor in conception. So tell me, do you think stress might be an issue?
30541	Carla	I swear, if you don't knock me up tonight, no more sex until you steal me a baby. So do it right this time.
30542	Turk	A little stress.
30543	Dr. Cox	OK, the antibiotics have brought your fever down, is there anything else I can do for you?
30544	Mr. Russell	Yeah, I'm auditioning for my church's senior citizen production of Streetcar Named Desire. Would you mind running lines with me?
30545	Dr. Cox	I'd be happy to.
30546	Mr. Russell	If I didn't know you was my wife's sister, I'd get ideas about you.
30547	Dr. Cox	I can't believe you'd think I'd do this with you. Are you insane? Seriously, I'm a doctor.
30548	Mr. Russell	What page are you on?
30549	J.D.	Why didn't you just read lines with the old guy?
30550	Dr. Cox	My job is to make sick people better, not to help Bernie in there score a slice of Episcopalian tail on opening night.
30551	J.D.	Sometimes you gotta go the extra mile with patients. That's what makes me such a special doctor.
30552	Dr. Cox	That, and your amazing ability to switch back and forth seamlessly between male and female genitalia.
30553	J.D.	Oooh.
30554	Dr. Cox	Newbie, snap out of it. I don't have time for your daydreaming.
30555	J.D.	Personally, me, I believe that medicine is about more than just treating the disease. You gotta be there for people. Take Mrs. Cohen, right? When she broke her hip I treated that, but she had also left her car double-parked, so being an "extra mile" kinda guy, I went and took car of it.
30556	J.D.	Sorry. It's been a little while since I drove stick.
30557	J.D.	I wonder how she got out of that truck. That's how she broke her hip.
30558	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
30559	Open	Nurses' Station.
30560	J.D.	Look, all I'm saying is it's important to go the extra mile with patients. It's like what I was telling this girl last night.
30561	Dr. Cox	Why would you tell her that?
30562	J.D.	I didn't. I just wanted to show you who I'm going out with tonight.
30563	Dr. Cox	Look, Newbie, there's a reason I can't go the extra mile with patients. It's something personal.
30564	J.D.	You can confide in me.
30565	Dr. Cox	I'm a *good* doctor. Kelly Rippa!
30566	J.D.'s Narration	It didn't bother me that Dr. Cox just "Kelly Rippa'd" me because I knew it would never catch on, no matter how much he wanted it to. This, however, did upset me.
30567	J.D.	Uh, Carol, we got the bone marrow biopsy back and, uh, I'm afraid you have leukemia.
30568	Carol	What?
30569	J.D.	Yes, but the good news is it's very treatable. We just have to get started right away.
30570	Dr. Cox	You know, in four and a half years, I've watched your pal, Stephanie, go through a multitude of irritating fads. The Ugg boots, the campaign for better grammar among the staff, and of course, double European air kiss, and seeing as you two are sorority sisters, I was kinda hoping you could tell me when this extra mile crap is going to end.
30571	Turk	Oh, it's never gonna end. He's relentless. Why do you think I was out Sunday Morning buying comics for my patient?
30572	Dr. Cox	They were giving out free Tastykakes at the comic book store? Ah HA! That used to work better when you were a fat load. Dammit.
30573	Turk	All right Jake, here it is. The latest "Vengeance." I had to travel to five stores to find that.
30574	Jake	This is last month's.
30575	Turk	Look, I'll track down a new one for you later, but right now I gotta make sure I have a job next year. OK?
30576	J.D.'s Narration	Since there were only three attending spots for ten surgical residents, Dr. Kelso could basically treat them like his own personal valets.
30577	Dr. Kelso	All-day sucker my ass. Try twenty minutes.
30578	Carla	Sir, quick question?
30579	Dr. Kelso	Make it very quick, I'm about to vomit.
30580	Carla	Why was I told to drop everything and look after some new patient coming in?
30581	Dr. Kelso	Mr. Sommers is a cousin of one of the trustees. Not important enough to warrant any face time with me, but connected enough that if one of those ding-dongs kills him, it will be my ass.
30582	J.D.	Carla, can you cover my patients?
30583	Dr. Kelso	She's already watching someone for me.
30584	J.D.	All right, I'll find somebody else.
30585	Carla	Why? Because I'm just a nurse and I can't look after everybody?
30586	Dr. Kelso	Precisely.
30587	Carla	J.D., why don't you tell me whats wrong with your patient, Mrs. Jones?
30588	Carla	Without looking at her chart?
30589	J.D.'s Narration	Carla knew that without their charts, doctors didn't know much about their patients.
30590	J.D.	Mr. Barry, I misplaced your chart, I forgot, what's wrong with you again?
30591	J.D.	Oh, that's right, you have a kitty-cat stuck in your mouth.
30592	J.D.	Or should I say you have a person stuck around you, little guy? Gootchie, gootchie.
30593	J.D.	It's not like nurses know everything.
30594	J.D.'s Thoughts	Uh-oh. Carla's gearing up to explode. Save yourself. Attempt a casual side-switch.
30595	J.D.'s Thoughts	And you're there. Now angry at Kelso.
30596	J.D.	Bob, how dare you?
30597	Carla	Exactly! You're worried about what I can handle? Vascular surgery wants an update every two hours on bed one. I'm weaning Mrs. Jones' dopamine from ten mics to five, Mrs. Meyersons's abdominal wound is dehiscing and Mr. Wilder's about to be turfed to psych because he thinks he's Flo from Alice.
30598	Mr. Wilder	Kiss my grits!
30599	Carla	Exactly, Flo, exactly.
30600	J.D.	I hoped you learned something today.
30601	Dr. Cox	Get a load of Mr. Extra-Mile-Guy's leukemia patient sitting there all by herself. Knowing him, he's probably out getting her a cake shaped like a cancerous white blood cell.
30602	J.D.	All right, team, let's stay close. Come on. Carol! Look who I found!
30603	Carol	Larry? Dad? How...?
30604	J.D.	Well, right after I got your test results back, I got on the horn with your dad and we started a phone tree to find everyone. There were some tears, mostly mine, but we got it done.
30605	Carol	You are the most amazing doctor.
30606	J.D.	Hear that, Perry? I'm the most amazing doctor because I went the extra 5280 feet. What's that? That's right, it's a mile. And how does that make me feel? Keith!
30607	J.D.	Thank you.
30608	Dr. Kelso	Attention, surgical residents still hoping to have a job next year. The annual blood drive is upon us and I will be needing a volunteer to greet our donors as the hospital's new mascot, the friendly hypodermic needle, Mr. Prick.
30609	Dr. Kelso	We'll probably change the name.
30610	Turk	I'm so sick of this. If the jobs were given to whoever's the best surgeon I would get all three of those damn spots.
30611	Elliot	It's the same on the medical side. I swear, the only the only reason I got that oncology rotation is because I let Dr. Morgan take me as his date his brother's wedding.
30612	Turk	Ricky Morgan?
30613	Elliot	Mmhmm.
30614	Turk	He works in the cafeteria.
30615	Elliot	What?!
30616	Turk	What?
30617	Elliot	Listen, kissing ass is the way it's done around here and there's nothing you can do about it.
30618	Turk	We have to all band together and agree not to be exploited by Dr. Kelso. From now on, we'll only be judged by our skill and abilities. Who's with me? That's right! That's right!
30619	Turk	From here on out, no more getting him coffee, no more washing his car, no more taking his son to the local steam baths to meet men!
30620	Todd	Well, hey, you guys got him coffee.
30621	Turk	Together on three. One, two, three.
30622	All	Together!!
30623	Mr. Sommers	What are you doing?
30624	Carla	Chief of Medicine said to pay special attention to you and I like to take a couple of seconds to get to know my patients. So first question: Are you allergic to any
30625	Janitor	Psst!
30626	Carla	What?
30627	Janitor	I need some advice.
30628	Janitor	Which do you prefer?
30629	Carla	What's the occasion?
30630	Janitor	Me, wiping up gunk. I was cleaning Kelso's tie rack and I assumed I could have it. I find the Armani is very effective on urine, whereas the Yves Saint-Laurent is good for
30631	Carla	No, no.
30632	Carla	What? Where'd he go?
30633	J.D.'s Narration	Carol's family had welcomed me as one of their own. No more so than her brother, Larry.
30634	J.D.	EAGLE!
30635	Larry	I told you not to call me Lawrence.
30636	J.D.	And I told you I never get dizzy!
30637	J.D.	OK, let me tell you guys why we're here. Carol is starting a journey, OK? Obviously the chemo is gonna be tough, but we're all here for you. Anything you go through, we go through together.
30638	Dr. Kelso	So. You've all banded together. I honestly never thought I'd see the day when we would pick the three surgeons who would care for the people of this great hospital based solely on merit. I hope you're proud of yourselves.
30639	Dr. Wen	This is a preliminary ranking of your technical skills. So, whenever you get a chance.
30640	J.D.'s Narration	Life in a hospital is constantly humbling. Whether it's making you realize you're not as skilled as you thought...
30641	Turk	Fourth?! I'm fourth!
30642	J.D.'s Narration	...or as on the ball as you thought.
30643	Dr. Kelso	How's Mr. Sommers doing?
30644	Janitor	Actually, sir
30645	Carla	He's perfectly fine, sir, he's in tip-top shape.
30646	Dr. Kelso	Good.
30647	Carla	Ow! What are you wearing, a cup?
30648	Janitor	Well, people try to hit me there more than you'd think.
30649	Carla	Ow.
30650	J.D.'s Narration	The key is to be ready for it.
30651	J.D.	I was not ready for this.
30652	Larry	Since Carol's going to lose all her hair in chemo, we decided we'd all shave our heads now. He even agreed to do the cutting.
30653	Dr. Cox	You're up next, there, big guy. I mean, come on. You're all in this together, right?
30654	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
30655	Open	Carol's room.
30656	J.D.	I can't believe you all shaved your heads. Oh, great, even Nana. You don't look creepy, or alien-like at all.
30657	Dr. Cox	Are you ready to run the extra mile?
30658	J.D.'s Thoughts	You can't let him know that you don't want to do this. Meet his gaze. Meet it twice as hard!
30659	Nurse	Dr. Dorian, we need you. Mr. Bentley's condition is getting worse.
30660	J.D.'s Thoughts	God bless his herpes.
30661	J.D.	I'm going to go take care of that man and when I come back...
30662	J.D.'s Thoughts	Pause for effect. Pause for effect.
30663	J.D.	We're gonna shave this thing.
30664	Turk	How the hell could I be fourth? I know Bonnie's good, and Figsack has mad hands, but somehow I keep forgetting that Todd is a skilled surgeon.
30665	Todd	Hey, how come you didn't page me back about that surgical consult?
30666	Elliot	I did. You're wearing your garage door opener on your hip.
30667	Turk	Ladies and gentlemen, number two.
30668	Carla	Kelso's gonna kill me. I can't find Mr. Summer.
30669	Janitor	Did you look between Mr. Spring and Mr. Fall? Ha ha! Too easy.
30670	Carla	Hey, you know wha ?
30671	Carla	More armor?
30672	Janitor	No, actually, I um, sneaking trays out of the cafeteria. I'm building a shed.
30673	Carla	This is partially your fault, so you're gonna help me find him.
30674	Doug	You know, whenever I lose something in the morgue, I just retrace my steps. Like right now, I'm looking for something, and I know I came to the vending machine, and then I dropped a quarter, which rolled over here and yep, there you are.
30675	Doug	As soon as you take your eyes off them, you lose them. They're like children. Big, dead children.
30676	Elliot	Oh my God, I treated that girl at the free clinic. She was born without nipples.
30677	J.D.	I knew there had to be something wrong with her, she's too perfect!
30678	Elliot	I was kidding, J.D. I have never seen her in my life. Kelly Rippa!
30679	Dr. Cox	I told you it would catch on.
30680	J.D.	I don't think it's funny.
30681	Dr. Cox	How's that leukemia patient of yours doing?
30682	J.D.	I'm hiding. I really don't want to be bald. I have a sneaking suspicion it won't work for me. It think it might accentuate my spoon chest.
30683	Dr. Cox	Mm.
30684	J.D.	Plus, the girl I'm dating is totally into my hair.
30685	Dr. Cox	She's gotta be interested in more than just your hair.
30686	Girl	If it weren't for your hair, I don't think I'd be remotely interested in you.
30687	J.D.	I'm sure there's something else she's into.
30688	Girl	No, there's nothing else.
30689	J.D.	There is, even if she won't admit it. You know what, I'm stuck, man. I have to shave this down.
30690	Dr. Cox	No you don't. You don't have to go the extra mile. That's what I've been trying to tell you. What the hell happened to the days when you used to listen to me?
30691	J.D.	That was a long time ago. Maybe you should listen to me for once.
30692	Dr. Cox	Not in this lifetime. Listen, Newbie, you're not a completely terrible, horrible, incompetent doctor and while I would never let any of my blood relatives be your patient, if it was someone that I knew, an acquaintance, I might be OK with you treating them.
30693	J.D.	Thank you.
30694	Dr. Cox	The only thing you owe Carol is to treat her the best you can.
30695	Larry	Hey, where you been?
30696	J.D.	Oh, Larry, man, I don't think I can shave my head.
30697	Larry	What about Carol?
30698	J.D.	She'll be OK. She has all you guys.
30699	Carla	You look over there.
30700	Janitor	Mmhmm.
30701	Turk	Excuse me, nurse? Hi, how about a poke?
30702	Carla	I have a husband, OK? And he's big and he's black and he's
30703	Turk	Baby! Baby, it's me. And I do love that you go to that big and black stuff.
30704	Carla	I can't wait to bear the fruit of your loins.
30705	Turk	W- Baby, wait! This is the only way I can I can suck up to Kelso without the other surgeons knowing about it!
30706	Janitor	There you are. You're not Mr. Sommers.
30707	Turk	No, I'm not.
30708	Janitor	No, I'm not.
30709	Turk	Wassup? Wit..Wit y'all?
30710	Jake	Dr. Turk, what happened to you?
30711	Turk	I found the latest issue of "Vengeance" at a comic book store a mile and half away. Here you go. Actually, I ran there in a foam needle suit, but you don't care.
30712	Jake	Thanks, Dr. Turk.
30713	Dr. Wen	Christopher, I heard you were sweating the rankings.
30714	Turk	No. I'm married and trying to have a baby. Not having a job would be a big boost for me.
30715	Dr. Wen	You're a good surgeon. Plus, your bedside manner is really important. There's no one on that list who spends more time with their patients as you do.
30716	Turk	Are you saying I have a job? If you are trying to Kelly Rippa me right now, I will freak out.
30717	Turk	Haha. I got a job!
30718	Janitor	Well, the good news is, his head isn't in the storage room. Because I once found a head in the storage room. It's a funny story actually. I put it in my locker because I didn't have time to get down to lost and found. Went on a long weekend and forgot all about it. Come back on Monday, open my locker, whooaaa! Head, plus rats! I panicked. I didn't know what to do, so I grabbed it and I ran up to the roof and I punt it! And I shank it wide left, like I always do. Now, it's heading right down to where Kelso is sitting in his convertible. I'm done. I'm out of a job, right? Wrong! At that second, a hawk flies in and grabs the thing and flies off with it. I know what you're thinking: we're in the middle of a city, what's a hawk doing there?
30719	Carla	I can't believe you get a locker and I don't.
30720	Ricky Morgan	Dr. Reid? I need to meet you in radiology to, you know, go over some test results.
30721	Elliot	Yeah, it's over, Ricky.
30722	Ricky Morgan	I know you're stealing trays. Stop it.
30723	Janitor	Buzz off.
30724	Elliot	Carla, the orderly lost my chart for Mr. Tyler in 406. Would we have his dosages in here somewhere?
30725	Carla	You were gonna put him on penicillin, but he was allergic so put him on a gram of engemycin.
30726	Elliot	Thank you.
30727	Janitor	You should put some of that crazy nurse memory to use on our missing dude.
30728	Carla	Well, he was an older guy. And he was on an IV so he couldn't have gotten very far.
30729	Carla	He was jittery. And he had this weird circle tanline on his arm. It was the nicotine patch! He was trying to quit smoking.
30730	Mr. Sommers	Should I not be out here?
30731	Dr. Kelso	There he is, Mr. Spot-On-His-Lung! Don't you worry, we'll pop that lung out of there, get it off to the dry-cleaners and have back to you a little after five. Ha ha ha! We like to have fun.
30732	Janitor	You know, I made up that whole hawk story.
30733	Carla	Yeah. I know you're not as weird as you want people to think you are.
30734	J.D.	Whew.
30735	J.D.	Whoa! Nana, how you doing? Looking hot in the track suit. Gym's on the second floor.
30736	J.D.'s Thoughts	Date time.
30737	Turk	Dude! There you are. Two things, first, the aliens are here and they're wearing track suits.
30738	J.D.	Oh no, that's Nana.
30739	Turk	Oh. Second, I got a job.
30740	J.D.	Nice.
30741	Turk	And if you hadn't pushed me to do all of that extra mile stuff, that probably wouldn't have happened. So, thank you. You got a hottie waiting for you at the bar. You go get her.
30742	J.D.	Woo! Ah. Where were we?
30743	Girl	Do I smell banana conditioner?
30744	J.D.	That's one of my conditioners, yes.
30745	J.D.'s Narration	As great as this was, I couldn't stop thinking about what Turk said and how
30746	J.D.'s Narration	Whoa, this girl really digs hair. The point is, it's hard getting what happens at the hospital out of your head.
30747	J.D.	AAHHH!
30748	Carla	How was your first stress-free day?
30749	Turk	Horrible. And you?
30750	Carla	Worse.
30751	Turk	Mm.
30752	Carla	Let's have a baby. If it doesn't work this time I'll kill myself.
30753	Turk	Not helping with the stress.
30754	J.D.'s Narration	I knew if I didn't leave that bar and go back, I'd never be able to enjoy any of the simple things. Even a woman eating my former bangs.
30755	J.D.	Voila!
30756	J.D.'s Narration	See, that's the thing about and extra mile guy. You never know who it's going to rub off on.
30757	Mr. Russell	Sister Blanche, I've got a little birthday remembrance for you.
30758	Dr. Cox	Oh? Have you, Stanley? I wasn't expecting any.
30759	Mr. Russell	I hope you like it.
30760	Dr. Cox	Uhhh...
30761	Mr. Russell	You're hating this, aren't you?
30762	Dr. Cox	No, that's that's not it at all. It's just that I don't believe for a second that you really want me to leave. You gotta feel the love, you gotta get involved. What do you people say, let's take it from the top?
30763	Mr. Russell	Sister Blanche, I've got a little birthday remembrance for you.
30764	Dr. Cox	Again. Do it with some force.
30765	Mr. Russell	I've got a

30767	Open	Nurses' Station. Turk walks through with a tracking device that is beeping.
30768	Elliot	What is that?
30769	Turk	This here is an electronic hide and seek game. The other person wears a sensor and the closer you get, the more it beeps.
30770	Elliot	Ah. Funsies. So Mrs. Facter here has a ??? and needs a surgical consult.
30771	Turk	Fire away.
30772	Elliot	See her red highlights?
30773	Turk	Yes.
30774	Elliot	Could I pull those off or am I so kidding myself?
30775	Turk	I really don't have time for this.
30776	Elliot	Turk, you're playing hide and seek.
30777	Turk	with my nine year-old gleoblastoma patient, Eric. He's been in the hospital for a month. I think he deserves a little fun, don't you?
30778	Elliot	Sorry, Turk.
30779	Turk	Hee hee hee hee!
30780	J.D.	How bad would she look with red highlights?
30781	Turk	I know. It is now my turn to hide.
30782	J.D.	All right, I'll count. Close a brother up.
30783	Elliot	So, I like to remember all of the carpal bones in the hand with a simple mnemonic device: Scaphoid, Lunate, Triquetrum, Pisiform, Trapezium, Trapezoid, Capitate and Hamate. Some Lovers Try Positions that They Can't Handle.
30784	Keith	Hey!
30785	Elliot	That was not directed at you, Doctor. But you should stretch first next time we try the whirlybird.
30786	Dr. Cox	Excuse me, but does anyone here happen to have a plate of Jeebies? Because these two here just have me a big, old scoop of the Heebies. Seriously, it cannot just be me.
30787	Dr. Cox	I want to hear from the audience, I do. Dating in the workplace: She's the boss, he's the pretty intern, tell me what's bugging you. Courage.
30788	Gloria	Well, sometimes they arrive in the morning and they smell like sex.
30789	Dr. Cox	Gloria, telling it like it smells. I'm proud of you. Barbie, who hurt you?
30790	Elliot	Is there something you want?
30791	Dr. Cox	Actually, yes. It is one of those rare days where you can be of use to me. You speak German, I have a patient from Berlin, and I need to tell the gentleman he has fluid in his lungs.
30792	Elliot	Ihre Frau hat einen schoenen busen.
30793	Dr. Cox	Ihre Frau hat einen schunnen busen.
30794	Elliot	Schoenen busen.
30795	Dr. Cox	Ihre Frau hat einen schoenen busen.
30796	German Guy	Was hast du gerade gesagt?
30797	Dr. Cox	Schoenen busen. How are you?
30798	Turk	Relax, dude. Just playing a little electronic hide and seek. Hey, baby...Yeah I know my shift's over...No, I'm not fooling around with J.D., I'm...OK, cool, I'm on my way home.
30799	Carla	All right, I just took the pregnancy test. Just tell me when a minute's up.
30800	Turk	I just put some pizza rolls in the microwave. The minute that bad boy dings, we're good to go.
30801	Carla	Oh my God, I can't stand it, thirty more seconds!
30802	Turk	OK, don't get too excited. They have to cool off for a minute. That cheese is like lava!
30803	Carla	Is there a bigger idiot than you in the entire world?
30804	J.D.	I'm seeking you, Turk!
30805	Carla	It's negative.
30806	Turk	Look at me. Hey, look at me. It's gonna happen.
30807	Carla	Eat your pizza rolls. I gotta get to work.
30808	Carla	By the way, next time buy a name-brand pregnancy test, not that cheap generic one.
30809	Turk	If you would raise my allowance, I wouldn't have to bargain shop so I could buy pizza rolls. Secondly, this pregnancy test works just as well as the name-brand one!
30810	Turk	Wait a second. Results in three minutes.
30811	J.D.'s Narration	Some things deserve to get tossed out on their asses.
30812	Dr. Cox	OH! Oooh! Schoenen busen.
30813	J.D.'s Narration	But the thing you shouldn't toss out is a pregnancy test that takes two minutes longer than you thought.
30814	Turk	Oh my God, we're pregnant.
30815	Turk	WAAHAAA! AAAAAHAAAAAAHAAAAAA!!

30821	Janitor	When I was 19, I was a world-class 110-meter hurdler.
30822	Janitor	Still remember nationals like they were yesterday.
30823	Announcer	Runners, take your positions. On your mark, set...
30824	Janitor	Good race.
30825	Janitor	They offered me a full ride and Grambling, but then I slept with the President's daughter. Not the college president, the President of the United States. But, hey, if Amy Carter asks you out for a nightcap, you do not say no.
30826	J.D.	No. No more. Here are some of the lies you've told us over the last five years: You went to Harvard. You have a wife who only has a pointer and thumb-pinky. You have a a brother-dad, a mother-sister. You have two kids, no wait, you have one kid, no wait, you had a baby with a Chinese local, you're a deaf-mute, oh wait, now you're telling us that you're a world class hurdler and you slept with the beautiful and irreplaceable Amy Carter?
30827	Janitor	I I didn't sleep with Amy Carter. We did everything but.
30828	J.D.	Ohh...
30829	Janitor	And I really was a world-class hurdler.
30830	J.D.	We're not buying it, are we gang?
30831	Everyone	No, nah, heck no...
30832	J.D.	The people have spoken. Allow me to bask in the glow.
30833	Turk	Oh-ho! J.D., guess what?
30834	J.D.	Not now, Turk, I'm glow-basking.
30835	Turk	Dude, listen to me!!
30836	Turk	Where is Carla?
30837	Dr. Cox	She just went downstairs. What is all the excitement?
30838	J.D.	You tell him. Aw, just wait a mi OK, you tell him.
30839	Turk	We're having a baby.
30840	Dr. Cox	Red states be damned, I'm sure you're going to make great fathers.
30841	Elliot	What's going on?
30842	J.D.	Why don't I tell
30843	Turk	OK, you go
30844	J.D.	Uh, Carla, preggo!
30845	Elliot	Oh, my God, Turk! Carla must be so happy!
30846	Turk	I haven't told her yet. I'm gonna go tell her now.
30847	J.D.	Wait, Turk! When has a man ever been able to tell his wife that she's pregnant? Allow me to paint you a picture with my imagination brush, OK? You two come out in the parking lot where all Carla's friends have gathered. They're holding a giant banner that says "Carla, you're pregnant, and I dove you." Did I say "dove?" I did, Turk. That's when I cue the bird-wrangler who releases 500 white doves into the air. Where do they land? I don't know. But one thing Carla knows is that in her uterus is a little, soft, baby Turk.
30848	Turk	Are you forgetting what happened when you made me have doves at my parents' anniversary party?
30849	J.D.	This won't be indoors, Turk, and there certainly won't be all those people throwing bird seed. Why were people throwing seed? It's a the point is that you, my friend, have a chance to be on the greatest surprise a husband has ever pulled for his wife. And you get credit for it the length of your entire marriage.
30850	Turk	I'm in!
30851	J.D.	Great, I'll tell everybody. You find Carla. Dr. Cox
30852	Dr. Cox	Halt! I will be doing nothing.
30853	Elliot	Well, you at least won't tell Carla, right?
30854	Dr. Cox	Ever since I was blitzkrieg'd this morning by an enraged German named Otto, a certain Dr. Barbie no longer exists for me. So, if she was to ask me a question, I wouldn't be able to hear it, and you'd have to repeat it.
30855	J.D.	Can you just please not tell Carla?
30856	Dr. Cox	Fine.
30857	J.D.	And Elliot, if you see Carla, don't get emotional.
30858	Elliot	Oh, no problem.
30859	J.D.	Really? Baby.
30860	Elliot	Oh, my God, Turk, Carla's gonna be so happy!
30861	Turk	The family wants me to do hip surgery, what are they thinking? The guy is 92!
30862	Carla	He's their grandfather. It's not like they can go to a kennel and they can pick out another one.
30863	Woman	We just got a lot of great new grandfathers in.
30864	J.D.	OK. Oooh, look at this one, he's so cute!
30865	Old man	Hey! Get out of my yard!
30866	Woman	He's not good with people.
30867	Woman	He's great, but we don't want to separate them.
30868	J.D.	I already have a grandma.
30869	J.D.	If I get one this little, everyone's gonna think I'm gay.
30870	J.D.	Aw, look at this fellow. Come here boy, I got a little hard candy for you.
30871	J.D.	Yes, you're a good boy. You got a candy you can unwrap in a movie theater!
30872	J.D.	I'd name him Sebastian.
30873	Carla	Hey, what's up with the Janitor? He seems a little more lurky than usual.
30874	J.D.	Yeah, I pissed him off earlier today. How am I supposed to avoid him?
30875	Turk	You should put the hide and seek sensor on him. That way you'll always know where he is.
30876	J.D.	It would take a very clever plan to hide this tiny, penny-like sensor on him.
30877	Turk	Five bucks if you eat this penny?
30878	Janitor	Done. And done.
30879	Turk	We pulled it off. See if it works.
30880	J.D.	Mr friend, we have just Lo-Jacked the Janitor. Hello.
30881	Elliot	Dr. Cox, I've got a patient with osteo-myelitis who needs a bone biopsy. Who do you use?
30882	Dr. Cox	You've put me in an awkward spot, because I'm a healer and I want to help, but speaking to you would acknowledge your existence, and you don't exist. So, I'm going to address the stapler. Hi, stapler, the red is killer. By the way, there's a certain Dr. Brownsfield who is just the most wonderful bone guy...
30883	Dr. Cox	...what's that? What's that, stapler? Oh no, she's an actual doctor.
30884	Elliot	Neither of you are very funny!
30885	Carla	Elliot, here are you lab results.
30886	Elliot	Oh, my God, Carla...
30887	Carla	Elliot, honey, what's wrong?
30888	Turk	Yeah, Elliot, honey, what's wrong?
30889	Elliot	Nothing, I'm just very emotional, because, um, Keith dumped me. I have to go.
30890	Carla	Another one. Shoot.
30891	Dr. Cox	Keith, I, uh, I've been watching you and you've got some potential. You do, but can I give you one piece of advice?
30892	Keith	Please.
30893	Dr. Cox	It is all about confidence. Hell, be a cocky bastard. Throw 'em a wink every once in a while. Show me a wink. Show me the wink. Give a me a wink.
30894	Dr. Cox	That's the guy. That's the guy who broke our friend's heart.
30895	Carla	Well, hey, he's probably hurting, too.
30896	Dr. Cox	Mmm?
30897	Keith	Hey, baby!
30898	Carla	Oh no, he did not just wink at me. For the next five minutes, I am not a nurse.
30899	Dr. Cox	Uh, no, Carla. There is a better way. I don't like it, but Jordan tells her friends intimate details about me. Our sex lives, my parenting deficiencies, the point is, I'm sure Elliot has told you things about Keith. So instead of yelling at him, why not calmly let him know that you know things that he thinks no-one knows.
30900	Carla	Oh, Keith, mind taking a walk with me?
30901	Keith	Yeah.
30902	Elliot	Is Carla gone?
30903	Dr. Cox	Yeah, she sure is. Say, Barbie.
30904	Elliot	Hmm.
30905	Dr. Cox	We're even.
30906	Elliot	Oh no.
30907	J.D.	All right everybody, before Carla arrives I want to thank you all for turning out, especially you, Father Rosenberg. Incidentally, when all this is over, I'd love to get the back story on that name of yours, OK?
30908	J.D.	Excuse me.
30909	J.D.	OK, coming through. OK, now apparently they don't have fetus balloons. Who knew? So what I've done is attach string to the belly buttons of these baby balloons to signify the umbilical cord. OK, make sure everybody gets one.
30910	Elliot	Keith, you seem to have missed the point here. We're not really broken up.
30911	Keith	I just can't believe you told Carla that I made out with my sister in the sixth grade.
30912	Elliot	Yeah, I don't understand why you're so embarrassed about that. I've met Denise. She's gorgeous.
30913	Turk	We're just going to have to face that fact that you might not get pregnant for a very, very, very long time.
30914	Carla	I know it's going to happen, Turk. And you know what I'm looking forward to the most?
30915	Turk	What's that?
30916	Carla	When we can go around to our friends and tell them one by one I'm pregnant. I can't wait to see the look of surprise on each one of their faces. I think about it every day. Anyone who tries to take those moments away from me, I'll kill them.
30917	Turk	Me too. Just need to send a quick text.
30918	J.D.	Oh no. We got a glitch. Abort the plan! Abort the surprise! Abort the babies!
30919	J.D.	EVERYBODY RUN!
30920	J.D.	Sorry about the whole "abort the babies" thing.
30921	Father Rosenberg	Actually, I'm pro-choice.
30922	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
30923	Open	Turk's and Carla's apartment. Turk and J.D. are in the living room. Carla brings wine for the three of them.)
30924	J.D.'s Narration	Knowing someone's pregnant when they don't know it themselves can get a bit complicated.
30925	Turk	You know what, let me take that from you. Um, you left the fridge open.
30926	Turk	Aw, I spilled it.
30927	Carla	I'll get another one.
30928	Turk	Sorry.
30929	Turk	What are you doing?
30930	J.D.	I may have gotten over-excited and told one or two of her family members that she's pregnant.
30931	Answering Machine	You have 59 messages.
30932	Relative	Carla...
30933	Carla	Turk, I think the answering machine is broken. And I don't think we have any more wine. Can I have some of yours?
30934	J.D.'s Narration	I felt like Turk was starting to blame me for all of this.
30935	Turk	I spilled mine, too, honey. You know what you should do? Ask for some of J.D.'s.
30936	J.D.	Spilled mine, too.
30937	Carla	I'm going to bed.
30938	J.D.	What are you going to do?
30939	Turk	I'm gonna go tell her the truth and hope that she's so tired from being pregnant that she doesn't have the strength to kick my ass for more than a few hours.
30940	J.D.	Wait, Turk! I have an idea.
30941	Turk	You have another idea, huh? I gotta tell you, I'm done with your ideas. And not just for now, but forever. OK, are we clear on that?
30942	J.D.	It's a good 'un.
30943	Turk	I'm listening.
30944	J.D.	OK, we need Carla to find out she's pregnant on her own and we need your help. Can we count on you?
30945	Dr. Cox	Absolutely not.
30946	Elliot	No way in hell.
30947	Dr. Kelso	Who's pregnant?
30948	J.D.	If we go down, we're taking you with us.
30949	Dr. Cox	What?
30950	Elliot	Why?
30951	Dr. Kelso	Would someone please tell me who's pregnant?
30952	Turk	Carla.
30953	Dr. Kelso	Another kid? My God, how many does that make?
30954	Turk	This is her first one.
30955	Dr. Kelso	If you say so, son.
30956	Elliot	You can't blackmail us.
30957	J.D.	Really? Because I think you're both very close to Carla, aren't you? And yet you chose not to tell her she was pregnant. Turk how would that go down for them?
30958	Turk	Unpleasantly.
30959	J.D.	Unpleasantly.
30960	Dr. Kelso	Ha. Got you two by the short ones.
30961	Turk	Dr. Kelso, it's true you didn't know anything, but I'm willing to bet that these guys would swear on their life that you did.
30962	Dr. Cox	Definitely.
30963	Elliot	On my life.
30964	J.D.	And I'd enjoy it.
30965	Dr. Kelso	Well played, Turkleton.
30966	Turk	Thank you.
30967	J.D.	OK, listen up. Everyone in the hospital knows Carla's pregnant, but they don't know that she doesn't know. We need her to find out on her own before anyone congratulates her, OK? Here's the plan. The three of us are going to run interference. Dr. Cox, Dr. Kelso, I need you to get her to take another pregnancy test. This plan is foolproof.
30968	Dr. Cox	That's impossible. You two are involved.
30969	Turk	Heh, we'll see about that.
30970	J.D.	You go left.
30971	Turk	OK. That was right.
30972	J.D.	Actually, I need to come with you.
30973	Laverne	Where's Carla?
30974	J.D.	Uh, she went up to the roof to get some air.
30975	Laverne	Oh.
30976	J.D.	Follow her. Lock her up there.
30977	Elliot	You got it.
30978	J.D.	Hello, Janitor, waiting around the corner to grab me.
30979	Janitor	How'd you know that was me?
30980	J.D.	I'm holding a GPS warning device that goes off whenever you come within a hundred meters of me. It's responding to a tiny sensor in your stomach.
30981	Janitor	I knew that wasn't a penny.
30982	J.D.	You'll never get anywhere near me.
30983	Janitor	We'll see.
30984	J.D.	Yeah, we will see.
30985	Janitor	Oh, we're gonna see.
30986	J.D.	The only thing left to do? See.
30987	Janitor	You're going to pay.
30988	J.D.	We'll see.
30989	Janitor	No time.
30990	J.D.	OK, bye.
30991	Turk	Dr. Cox, Dr. Kelso, look who I found.
30992	Dr. Cox	Hey, Carla, you're glowing.
30993	Carla	Really?
30994	Dr. Kelso	Nurse Espinosa, have your breasts gotten bigger?
30995	Carla	Whoa, Dr. Kelso, that is inappropriate.
30996	Turk	Baby, that sounds like a compliment to me. Maybe you're just a little hormonal.
30997	Dr. Cox	Well done, Bob, a little direct, but I think we've definitely put the idea of pregnancy in her head.
30998	Dr. Kelso	Oh, is that what we were doing? I was just making conversation.
30999	Carla	I have been a little moody.
31000	Turk	Yes, you have, baby.
31001	Carla	Plus, this morning I was nauseous, but I thought it was just the pizza rolls I had for breakfast. Yes, I like them, we can get them from now on. Still, Turk, do you think that I should go home and take another pregnancy test?
31002	Turk	It's your call, baby.
31003	Laverne	Hey!! Somebody get me down from here!
31004	Carla	What's she yelling about?
31005	J.D.	I don't know, I'll have someone from the psych ward check her out.
31006	Intern	Hey. Dr. Dorian, I got those batteries you asked for.
31007	J.D.'s Narration	I was a little anxious because it was tie to change Mr. Beeper's batteries. All clear to the left, all clear to the right. You can do this.
31008	Janitor	He's 100 meters away, and it's going to take him at least ten seconds to change those batteries. That's not even a world record pace. Ready, set, go.
31009	Janitor	Time!
31010	Janitor	Still got it.
31011	J.D.'s Narration	As I lay there, watching Nurse Roberts hammer-throw 23 pounds of high end fruit my way, I could take solace in one thing.
31012	Carla	We're having a baby!!
31013	J.D.'s Narration	Any second now, Carla and Turk were coming to tell me they were pregnant. Carla had to believe that I was truly surprised.
31014	J.D.'s Narration	I was the lynch pin of our plan. Showtime.
31015	Carla	Hey, J.D. We have such big news!
31016	J.D.	What's the scoop? I would have no clue what it could be.
31017	Carla	We're having a baby!
31018	J.D.	Oh!
31019	J.D.'s Thoughts	Now give them the ten minute emotional roller coaster ride that is the speech you've been practicing all afternoon.
31020	J.D.	Carla, when Turk first told me, I
31021	Carla	What do you mean "when Turk first told you?"
31022	J.D.	Oh boy.
31023	Turk	Uh...We've known for a day. That pregnancy test you took yesterday was positive. Yeah, I wanted to have everybody at the hospital gather outside and surprise you with balloons and stuff.
31024	J.D.	What would you have thought of doves?
31025	Turk	J.D., not now. I just wanted to do something really memorable, you know? And I messed that up.
31026	Carla	So everybody already knows?
31027	J.D.'s Narration	Then I witnessed one of those moments that let me know in my heart that these two would be together forever.
31028	Carla	Who cares? We're having a baby. We're having a baby!
31029	J.D.	Yeah, we are.
31030	Carla	A baby! A little you.
31031	Turk	Yeah, but a lot of you.
31032	Carla	It's OK. I already know. I'm pregnant.
31033	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
31034	Open	Hallway. J.D. passes through.
31035	J.D.'s Narration	A month ago I shaved my head to show solidarity with a leukemia patient. Of course, there were ramifications.
31036	J.D.	Hello, I'm your doctor.
31037	Krishnas	Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna/ Krishna Krishna Hare Hare...
31038	J.D.	Oh, no no, I know I've got the hair, but I'm not one of you people...
31039	J.D.	Hello, how are you? Well, I have been known to tambour.
31040	Group	Hare Krishna Hare Krishna...
31041	J.D.'s Narration	After our tambourine jam they gave me some literature, but I'm not the type that's easily sucked in by that stuff.
31042	Dr. Mickhead	Good morning, Dr. Dorian.
31043	J.D.	Praise be to Krishna! Dammit.
31044	J.D.	Hey, Mr. Coleman, how are you feeling?
31045	Mr. Coleman	They call me mellow yellow.
31046	J.D.	Um, Mr. Coleman, the hepatitis is doing a number on your liver. You're obviously very jaundiced...yellow! Oh, mellow yellow, I get it, that's funny! You know, I never knew what that song was about. Now I now I finally get it. Liver disease. Anyway, we're going to give you suppressive therapy and do everything we can to make sure you don't need a liver transplant, OK?
31047	Mr. Coleman	OK.
31048	J.D.	All right, see you, Mr. Coleman.
31049	J.D.'s Narration	Unfortunately, a month later...
31050	Mr. Coleman	Let's hear it.
31051	J.D.	Frank, we have no more options. We gotta get you a new liver.
31052	Jordan	So how is the boy toy thing going? I'm thinking of trading Perry in for a younger model.
31053	Elliot	Actually, we're getting kind of serious, so I...
31054	Dr. Cox	Excuse me. I need a moment of silence so I can get into a meditative state where I block out any and all irritating white noise. I call it my happy place.
31055	Elliot	You know, it's kind of rude...
31056	Elliot	...well I can understand you haven't had...
31057	Jordan	Uh, sweets, he can't hear you.
31058	Elliot	Really?
31059	Jordan	Mm-mm.
31060	Elliot	I was the one who puked on your Porsche after Turk and Carla's wedding.
31061	Elliot	Ugh, that has been eating at me for two years. Anyway, Keith is great, the only thing is his last name is um...Dudemeister.
31062	Jordan	Oh, that doesn't even sound real.
31063	Elliot	Well, it's actually German, Dudemeister means master of dudes.
31064	Jordan	You know, one of the reasons I divorced Perry was because of his last name.
31065	Elliot	You don't like Cox?
31066	Jordan	Actually, I love Cox.
31067	Todd	Greatest conversation ever.
31068	Jordan	See, that's the problem.
31069	Female	This sausage is huge!
31070	Todd	Excuse me, ladies. I'm needed elsewhere.
31071	Jordan	You know what? the four of us should go out for drinks sometime.
31072	Elliot	Actually, we're free tonight.
31073	Jordan	It's a couple date!
31074	Elliot	Done!
31075	Dr. Cox	Something horrible just happened.
31076	J.D.	All right, buddy. Today's the day.
31077	J.D.'s Narration	The amazing thing about livers is that a healthy person can actually have part of it removed and give it to somebody else. For Frank, that person was his brother, Marc.
31078	Marc	Hey, somebody order a liver? Ha ha ha! Uh oh. Jello? Jello? Is this thing on?
31079	J.D.'s Narration	Marc was a stand-up comic on a cruise ship.
31080	Marc	If I'm not careful, they'll put me in the pun-itentiary.
31081	J.D.'s Narration	He was a genius.
31082	Mr. Coleman	Thanks for doing this for me, man.
31083	Marc	Hey, what's mine is yours, little bro. You know that.
31084	Turk	I didn't get that one.
31085	J.D.	I didn't either. Hey, Turk, if you ever donated a body part to me, you know which one I'd want?
31086	J.D.	Hey, thanks for the butt, playa!
31087	Carla	You better have a reason for taking my man's badonka-donk donk.
31088	J.D.	I do, Carla. I'm building something.
31089	Elliot	What?
31090	J.D.	A brick house!
31091	Laverne	Dr. Turk? Todd needs you in the lab.
31092	Turk	Tell Todd he can kiss my big, black ass. Bet you wish you could say that.
31093	J.D.	I do.
31094	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
31095	Open	Mr. Coleman's room.
31096	Marc	Brr. These gowns do not protect the fellows against a cool breeze, do they?
31097	Mr. Coleman	You'll get used to it.
31098	Turk	OK, we'll be back to check on you guys a little later, all right?
31099	Marc	OK, we'll be the guys that look like us.
31100	Turk	How does he come up with this stuff?
31101	J.D.	You know, you could be a dynamite center square.
31102	Turk	Dude, four more hours and I am off.
31103	J.D.	You mean we are off. I changed my schedule which means I have Thursday nights off which means we are going out which means you are going to be my wingman. Even though you're horrible at it.
31104	Turk	When have I been a bad wingman?
31105	(Flashback	Theta Omega house at Turk and J.D.'s college. Turk has painted his face white and is dressed in preppy clothes. J.D. is wearing baggy clothes and has painted his face black.
31106	J.D.	Turk, are you sure this isn't offensive? It doesn't look like anybody else is wearing a costume.
31107	Turk	Buddy, relax. These are my guys, all right? As long as you're with me, they're going to find this funny.
31108	J.D.	All right.
31109	Turk	That looks like Talia.
31110	J.D.	Wazzup!
31111	J.D.	Waaaah!!
31112	Turk	My bad, my bad.
31113	J.D.	Wooo! Ahh!
31114	Turk	That that wasn't Talia.
31115	J.D.	Every time I saw them they yelled out "cracker." How did they know I love crackers?
31116	Dr. Cox	Please don't make me go out with Barbie, and yes, I know it's too easy, Ken.
31117	Jordan	But we haven't gone out with another couple in over a year.
31118	Dr. Cox	Jordan, there's a reason for that.
31119	Dr. Zeltzer	Wh-wh-whoa, slow down there, big guy.
31120	Dr. Cox	Why, Zeltzer? It's not like I'm driving.
31121	Dr. Zeltzer	I know, but there was a roofie in it.
31122	Jordan	I'm not sure if I'm OK with that.
31123	Dr. Zeltzer	Three, two, one.
31124	Dr. Zeltzer's wife	Party time.
31125	Jordan	I think we should give them another chance.
31126	Carla	Whoa!
31127	Dr. Kelso	Nurse Espinosa, I need your help with something. My dog, Baxter, passed away last night. I dealt with it emotionally, but unfortunately, I can't stop crying. Anyway, I need you to run interference for me today. Keep people from seeing me looking vulnerable and so forth.
31128	Carla	So you think I'll automatically do this? You think my ego is so big that I'll be flattered that I'm the only one you can open up to? I'll do it.
31129	Marc	Wish us luck guys!
31130	J.D.	Good luck fellas.
31131	Dr. Cox	All the best.
31132	J.D.	We'll be rooting for you.
31133	Turk	Good luck.
31134	J.D.	And I will see you later.
31135	Turk	Wonderful.
31136	Dr. Cox	What are you two gonna do? Stay up late, eat raw cookie dough and pinky-swear that you're diet will start tomorrow?
31137	Turk	What is your problem?
31138	Dr. Cox	Ah, Jordan is forcing me to double-date with the Dudemeisters.
31139	Turk	Because of J.D., I gotta miss Turk Night. Yeah, I only have three nights off during the week. Two of nights Carla has off two, so we gotta do married stuff.
31140	Dr. Cox	Fighting, arguing, bickering and the occasional quickie?
31141	Turk	Exactly. But Thursday nights, I got the apartment to myself. So you know, I come home...
31142	Turk's Voiceover	I open the door. I immediately get comfortable. Then I take care of all my busy work. Case dictation, patient charts, everything.
31143	Turk's Voiceover	Then I watch whatever's on ESPN.
31144	TV Announcer	Stay tuned for more Gilmore Girls!
31145	Turk	Mothers and daughters. They speak so fast, but they speak so true.
31146	Turk's Voiceover	I make some important work calls.
31147	Turk	Did you see it?
31148	J.D.	I am so mad at Lorelei I can't even talk right now.
31149	Turk	That's Turk Night.
31150	Dr. Cox	God, you're boring.
31151	Elliot	Hey, just need to talk to Kelso.
31152	Carla	You can't come in.
31153	Elliot	Why?
31154	Dr. Kelso	I have no pants on.
31155	Carla	He spilled coffee on them. I wish I didn't have to see those pale legs.]
31156	Elliot	Ask him if we can get a new label-maker in the pharmacy. The "P" is broken and nobody knows what "enicillin" is.
31157	Carla	Oh. Sir, she just wants...
31158	Dr. Kelso	Just tell her no!
31159	Carla	But, sir, she just...
31160	Dr. Kelso	If it makes you feel better, you can pretend you're fighting for her. Yell "hear me out, Bob."
31161	Carla	Hear me out, you old jackass!
31162	Dr. Kelso	No ad-libbing! Now send her packing.
31163	Carla	He said yes.
31164	Elliot	Coolio!
31165	Dr. Kelso	You think you're funny. My job is to spend the day saying "no" to people. And now that you have let a "yes" spread out into the world, you have opened the floodgates.
31166	Laverne	Can we have bibles in the patients' rooms?
31167	Carla	No.
31168	Ted	Can I get a better hands-free headset for my phone?
31169	Carla	No.
31170	Todd	Can I be allowed back in the men's locker room?
31171	Carla	No!
31172	Janitor	Can I get some new work boots?
31173	Carla	No.
31174	Janitor	Guess the old ones still work. I do have more requests though. I need an anvil, some barbed wire and a bow and arrow.
31175	Carla	No.
31176	Janitor	Hm. How about a sled dog?
31177	Carla	No.
31178	Janitor	Cowboy hat?
31179	Carla	No.
31180	Janitor	Ferris wheel?
31181	Carla	No.
31182	Janitor	Stun gun?
31183	Carla	No.
31184	Janitor	Pelican?
31185	Carla	No!
31186	Dr. Kelso	I'll be on the couch, napping.
31187	Jordan	Sweetie, calm down. If you're miserable, you can just talk to me. I won't abandon you, all right?
31188	Jordan	Hey! Oh my God...
31189	Elliot	...I love your jacket...
31190	Jordan	...I love your necklace...
31191	Keith	Hey, uh, Dr. Cox, can you get me beer? I forgot my ID.
31192	Dr. Cox	Ohh..
31193	Turk	I can't believe people hang out at bowling alleys now.
31194	J.D.	It's great. You surround yourself with some new friends. You say one clever thing and you're in. Watch this. You guys, let's tally it up, gather round! Whoa, Carol! 180, amazing! Lisa, you had a 125. Turk, 192!
31195	Turk	That's how we do!
31196	J.D.	And bowled a gentleman's 40. Now, who wants to help me off with my shoes? I forgot to wear socks.
31197	J.D.	I'm losing them.
31198	Turk	If you ladies remain in this area, we'll bring back drinks.
31199	J.D.	Nice save.
31200	J.D.	Krishnas.
31201	Turk	Relax, they'll never recognize you.
31202	Fraternity Brother	Good to see you again.
31203	J.D.	Wazzup?
31204	Elliot	I hate it when Keith wears that shirt. We get it. You like sports.
31205	Jordan	Sweetie, you have to dress your man. For God's sake, Perry walked out of the house tonight in a hockey jersey.
31206	Keith	Dr. Cox, when you first st
31207	Jordan	Hey you! Make an effort!
31208	Dr. Cox	Ah. You may tell me who your favorite sports team is. Keep it short.
31209	Keith	Detroit Red Wings.
31210	Dr. Cox	Oh.
31211	Dr. Cox	For the next twenty minutes, you will sit in silence while I tell you why the Detroit Red Wings are the greatest franchise in the history of professional sports. On September 25, 1926...
31212	J.D.	Look at you, man, you're color's back, there's no sign of infection.
31213	Mr. Coleman	I feel I feel great.
31214	J.D.	You look great, man, I'm glad.
31215	Mr. Coleman	Thanks.
31216	J.D.'s Narration	Unfortunately, things weren't going as well for Marc.
31217	Laverne	He's hypertensive and tachycardic.
31218	J.D.'s Narration	Sometimes that's the way life works. The ones who do the nice things suffer the most. Whether it's giving up Turk Night for a friend...
31219	Dr. Wen	Christopher, why haven't you finished your case reports?
31220	Turk	Sorry, Dr. Wen, I was going to do them last night, but I wound up going out with my buddy, right?
31221	Dr. Wen	Just get them done.
31222	J.D.'s Narration	...Or going out with an intern to make your wife happy...
31223	Leslie	Hey, Dr. Cox, we're going coffee, you want to come?
31224	Dr. Cox	Get get the hell away from me.
31225	Dr. Cox	Why are you all smiling?
31226	Leslie	Keith said you'd be mean. But then you'd tell us sports stories.
31227	Dr. Cox	Oh my God.
31228	J.D.'s Narration	...or agreeing to be the bad guy for your boss.
31229	Carla	Hi!
31230	Carla	Oh, come on!
31231	J.D.'s Narration	When you're the one paying the price it can really make you wonder...
31232	J.D.	He's bleeding out. Prep the OR. CAN I HAVE THE CRASH CART IN HERE!!
31233	J.D.'s Narration	...was it worth it?
31234	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
31235	Open	Marc's room.
31236	Turk	So one of the ligation sutures came undone, but we got it in time. He should be fine now.
31237	J.D.	OK, Nurse Winston, call me if there's any change.
31238	J.D.	Dude, how awesome was last night?
31239	Turk	Dude, you got bowled by my frat brothers.
31240	J.D.	No, man, we're all cool now. They even invited me to this alumni thing they're having in January.
31241	Turk	The Martin Luther King Fling?
31242	J.D.	Sounds hot. Hey, we're going out Thursday, right? Because I went online and got a magic eight-ball bowling ball. Check this: Are the ladies going to love this? "Ask again later?" Oh, I'm just kidding, it says yes.
31243	Turk	You know what? Thursday night might not work for me.
31244	J.D.	You're going. Where are the interns?
31245	Turk	They're with Dr. Cox. Apparently he's mentoring them and talking to them and stuff.
31246	J.D.'s Thoughts	What?!
31247	Dr. Cox	OK, that's it! This right here is the "get hit line." Cross it at your own risk.
31248	Leslie	When do you turn nice? This is getting kind of old.
31249	Dr. Cox	Never, Leslie.
31250	Leslie	He knows my name!
31251	Dr. Cox	I was just calling you by a random girl's name. Listen, please, I don't care about any of your problems. I have no answers for any of you.
31252	Gloria	But my boyfriend is bi-curious and he wants me to pick his lovers.
31253	Dr. Cox	I might have an answer for that: Ew. I mean come on, children, what do you actually think is going to happen here? Do you think I'm going to take you and sit you down next to me and say, uh, "listen, um, if you need anything...
31254	Dr. Cox	...you've got my pager. Just know that I'm there for you, always."
31255	J.D.	Oh. My. God.
31256	Dr. Cox	Newbie...
31257	J.D.	No! Zip it! I am so G-darn pissed right now. I was OK when you kept me at an arm's length because everybody said "that's just Cox. That's how he operates." And I believed them. Now I walk in on this. This bi-racial love fest? You know what? I hate to do it, but I'm giving you back the pencil. That's right. The pencil you gave me on my third day of work. You handed it off to me like a like a tiny yellow baton. Like you were trying to say to me "J.D., you are the new me. You, J.D., are my mentee. You are my son."
31258	Dr. Cox	What pencil?
31259	J.D.	Oh, that's perfect.
31260	J.D.	That's perfect. You know what, take it!
31261	J.D.	Maybe you can use it with Rex, or Gloria, or that guy.
31262	Dr. Cox	That guy's name is Leslie.
31263	J.D.	Heh. His name is Leslie. His name is Leslie. You're name is Leslie. All right, good for you, Leslie.
31264	J.D.	LESLIE!
31265	Carla	So do you think everyone's still mad at me?
31266	Elliot	Oh, I'm...
31267	Janitor	Guys, come on, I'm the only one giving the evil eye. We worked on this. Hey, Ted, you're giving sad eye.
31268	Ted	It's all I've got!
31269	Janitor	I don't believe that. Now come on. Let's suck it up. Dig deep, concentrate and just...
31270	Janitor	And break. Nice. Very nice, guys, even you.
31271	Todd	I just thought about flat boobies and it made me mad.
31272	Carla	What do I have to do to make it up to you?
31273	Laverne	Go, Ted.
31274	Ted	We want tickets to the Latin Grammys. We figure you might know someone.
31275	Carla	I don't.
31276	Elliot	Oh, Carla, please...
31277	Carla	Elliot! I don't.
31278	Elliot	How about she just buys rounds for everyone at the bar?
31279	Laverne	Martinis, cool.
31280	Ted	Aww.
31281	Todd	Oh, OK, see you, guys.
31282	Carla	That was easy, hm?
31283	Janitor	Latin Grammys o nada.
31284	Carla	A bunch of interns are looking for you.
31285	Dr. Cox	I know. I'm in my streets because I'm sneaking out of here early. All because of Jordan and her stupid couples' night.
31286	Dr. Zeltzer	Oh, Perry, speaking of couples nights, I don't know if you and Jordan like camping, but this weekend, me and the wife, and a pretty interesting guy named Ron are heading out to the lake.
31287	Dr. Cox	Keep moving, Zeltzer.
31288	Dr. Zeltzer	Rain check.
31289	Carla	So, you gotta leave early. Thanks to Kelso, I gotta take half the hospital staff out for drinks so they don't hate me.
31290	Turk	Thanks to J.D. I'll be up forever doing these damn case reports. Plus, I lost the one night a week that I look forward to.
31291	Carla	What about the two nights a week we spend together?
31292	Turk	Now I am *so* mad at J.D.
31293	Dr. Cox	That's it. We gotta let these people know what they're putting us through.
31294	Carla	Let's do this.
31295	Turk	Let's do it.
31296	Jordan	I like this particular outfit because it's casual and the pant pockets are extra deep which is perfect for storing makeup.
31297	Elliot	He's like a giant purse!
31298	Jordan	Ah!
31299	Keith	This shirt is itchy.
31300	Jordan	Oh, oh, ssh-ssh. Purses don't talk.
31301	Dr. Cox	Jordan, you promised this would never happen.
31302	J.D.	How dare you!
31303	Dr. Cox	Could we talk?
31304	Jordan	One sec. I just wanted to thank you for the other night. Since Perry and I had Jack, we don't get to go out that much as a couple and it was really nice. Don't tell anyone I'm nice.
31305	Elliot	Oh, Mm. No.
31306	Carla	Dr. Kelso, we need to talk.
31307	Dr. Kelso	Baxter was a good dog. You never think you're going to miss animals as much as you do. It was just nice having some creature in my life who never disappointed me. Never judged me. Never showed up late at my 50th birthday party with freshly pierced nipples and a barely-legal Filipino boy named Pogo. My son Harrison.
31308	Carla	I figured.
31309	Dr. Kelso	Man's best friend, huh? They got that one right.
31310	Carla	At least you stopped crying.
31311	Dr. Kelso	Oh, not really. My body can't produce tears anymore because I've intentionally dehydrated myself. It's a risky move, I know, but Dr. Jarvis here said it'll be all right.
31312	Carla	There's nobody standing behind you.
31313	Dr. Kelso	I'm going to need an IV.
31314	Turk	J.D. Can I talk to you?
31315	J.D.	I can't right now, I gotta go check on Frank.
31316	Turk	So, you missing the other half of you liver?
31317	Marc	Oh, I'm not. But my gall bladder's pretty broken up about it. Apparently they had a thing.
31318	Turk	You got a gift, man, a gift! Did your brother freak out when you told him you almost died?
31319	Marc	Oh, I didn't tell Frank. Look at him. He's so happy. If he knew what I went through, he'd feel terrible. Why would I want to do that to him when I love him so much?
31320	J.D.	Hey, Turk, you wanted to talk to me?
31321	Jordan	You wanted to talk to me?
31322	Dr. Kelso	You wanted to talk to me?
31323	Keith	Dr. Cox, can we talk about something besides sports this time?
31324	Dr. Cox	Uhh...
31325	Carla	You're OK.
31326	Dr. Cox	OK, uh, Keith, you may choose between good scotch, ab workouts or Lee Marvin movies.
31327	Carla	And who over here needs a refill?
31328	Todd	Yes, please.
31329	Laverne	Thanks for the 'tini, Carla.
31330	Carla	You got it, mama.
31331	Carla	Here you go, grumpy.
31332	Janitor	Latin Grammys!
31333	Carla	I can tell you the nominees?
31334	Janitor	Rapidoso.
31335	Carla	Category?
31336	Janitor	Uh, reggaeton.
31337	J.D.	I'm having a great time, man.
31338	Turk	Me too.
31339	J.D.	Cheers.
31340	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
31341	Open	Admissions Area. Carla is holding and petting a hamster.
31342	Carla	Ohh, what a cutie. Where did this little guy come from?
31343	J.D.	Doug found him in some dead guy's colon.
31344	Carla	Plagh!
31345	J.D.	Hey little guy. Doug's still pretty upset about the whole thing.
31346	Doug	Why would he live in there?
31347	Turk	Diseased rodent should be nowhere near my pregnant princess.
31348	J.D.'s Narration	Carla being pregnant had changed everyone. It made Dr. Kelso softer.
31349	Dr. Kelso	Ahh, I think the children in pediatrics would love this little fella. Ha ha!
31350	J.D.'s Narration	Carla's pregnancy also affected Elliot.
31351	Elliot	OK, so we're both off in a few minutes. Here's what's going to happen. We're heading back to my place.
31352	Keith	Oh, yeah?
31353	Elliot	I'm going to put on something very naughty.
31354	Keith	Awesome.
31355	Elliot	And then we're going to have sex and pretend that we aren't using protection and that we're trying to make a baby.
31356	Keith	Un-awesome.
31357	Elliot	Keith, we're doing this. I need it.
31358	J.D.'s Narration	As for me, I bought a custom-made Italian suit.
31359	J.D.	Eh? What do you think? I had it made for the christening. That little mixed-race embryo got a godfather yet?
31360	Turk	J.D., that's something we have to discuss as a couple.
31361	Carla	You know what, I'm not sure that suit works on you.
31362	J.D.	Thanks for your opinion, Carla. But I'm much more interested in what you all think.
31363	Lonnie	We don't love it.
31364	J.D.	Well, who cares, Lonnie. Because all that really matters is whether or not America loves it.
31365	Americo	For the last time, it's Americo. And of course I love it. I made it!
31366	J.D.	He's a dynamite tailor. Not sure why he's here.
31367	Carla	You better put your scrubs on, Herbert's back.
31368	J.D.	How you doing, buddy?
31369	J.D.'s Narration	Because of his weight, Herbert was a frequent visitor and no one liked treating him.
31370	J.D.'s Narration	He wasn't a mean thing. See, with big people, even the simple stuff is more difficult. I didn't mind, because Herbie was my man.
31371	J.D.	How you feeling, love bug?
31372	Herbert	Fully loaded. Hey, it's time for my sponge bath, right? I need three girls...
31373	J.D.	Herbie, it's not a bath house.
31374	J.D.	We'll get those bandages off later today, Mr. Brooks, all right
31375	Mr. Brooks	Mmhmm.
31376	Dr. Cox	OK, as you all know, Sacred Heart is dealing with a mountain of malpractice lawsuits, courtesy of bumbling interns, clueless doctors and hack surgeons, or as like to refer to them, you people. Now since Sweaty Teddy here backs up his infinitesimal knowledge of the law with absolutely zero knowledge of medicine, one of you is going to have to help him go through the claims, decipher the medical stuff and somehow relay all of that into his tiny, peanut brain. Ted, how many times did I insult you during that speech? I was shooting for five.
31377	Ted	Only three unless you count "Sweaty Teddy" as an insult, but my mom calls me that and she loves me, right?
31378	Dr. Cox	No, Ted, she hates you. Four. Now since Ted has no life, and that's five, I'm going to let him hand-select his very own victim. Ted?
31379	Ted	I'll take Claire!
31380	Claire	Oh, God.
31381	Ted	You turned me down fourteen times for drinks. Well, who's the creepy loser now, huh?
31382	J.D.'s Narration	And just like that, I had the chance to comfort Claire.
31383	J.D.	You look like you need to be rescued.
31384	J.D.'s Narration	Life was good, but then came a surprise visit from my brother, and a round of the game he likes to call "Watch her leave."
31385	Dan	There's no easy way to say this. We've got the crabs.
31386	Dan	Oh, she was cute.
31387	J.D.	Yes, she was, Dan. Thank you. We'll be right back.
31388	Patient	Was he talking to us?
31389	Carla	Don't know, don't care. Here, take this.
31390	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
31391	Open	Cafeteria.
31392	J.D.	So, Dan. To what do we owe this...something?
31393	Dan	I had to blow out of town. Mom doinked her new boyfriend and then goaded him into getting me a job interview where he works. Yuhh.
31394	J.D.	Well, you know, Mom does what she has to do.
31395	Dan	What do I need with a full time job? I got a sweet setup and home, I got this sweet bed up in Mom's attic, I'm driving Dad's old Plymouth Horizon, rest his soul, and because I'm the senior bartender at K-Diggs, I get to take home half the extra chicken wings, thank you.
31396	Dr. Cox	Dan, do you ever have to pinch yourself to make sure it's not all some crazy dream?
31397	Dan	That does not count as a formal hello, Coxsmith.
31398	J.D.	Don't call him Coxsmith.
31399	Dan	I call him Coxsmith.
31400	J.D.	Well, OK.
31401	Dan	So what's new around here?
31402	Turk	Carla's pregnant.
31403	Dan	Dude, bummer.
31404	Turk	No, we're trying to have kids.
31405	Dan	Oh, congratulations. That's great. Not really a big kid person. Are you guys totally, uh, freaking out?
31406	Carla & Turk	Nah...
31407	J.D.'s Narration	And they weren't. They were taking it all in stride.
31408	Carla	OK, here's how I think we should name our baby. It's what my parents did. If it's a girl, I get to pick the name. If it's a boy, you pick the name.
31409	Turk	OK.
31410	Carla	I like "Angie" for a girl.
31411	Turk	And if it's a boy, say hello to Fu'Kwan! Wassup!
31412	Carla	OK, you know what? I think we should pick the names together.
31413	Turk	OK. Because I was thinking, you know, for a girl...
31414	Carla	Sweetie, we already have a girl's name. And for a boy, why not name him after your cousin?
31415	Turk	Tiger?
31416	Carla	Turk, I'm begging you to stop telling people that, no one believes you.
31417	Turk	Well tell that to the last two women I slept with before you, OK? Sha-boing. Boing.
31418	Turk	Oh, God.
31419	Carla	I'm talking about your other cousin, George.
31420	Turk	I like that.
31421	Carla	Yeah.
31422	Turk	George and Angie, all right.
31423	Carla	Oh, and if you mention the names to anyone, they'll ruin them for us, so don't tell anyone, OK? No one.
31424	J.D.	What's up my negro amigo?
31425	Turk	Nothing.
31426	J.D.	Hey, I paged you because I can't figure out what's going on with Herbert. He's got acute back pain and no cauda equina signs.
31427	Turk	If we have a girl, we're gonna name her Angie.
31428	Dan	Hey, Chris. If there was a test to see of your baby was gay would you do it?
31429	Carla	Oh, sweetie, he's...
31430	Turk	Extremely, yes. And I'm OK with it.)
31431	Dan	Anyway, Elliot wasn't in the lab.
31432	Turk	Oh, she's at home.
31433	J.D.	Oh, you know what, I'll be done in a couple of seconds. We'll find her.
31434	Dan	OK. Hi, Herbert.
31435	Herbert	Keep it cool, man.
31436	Dan	Dan train. Woo woo!
31437	J.D.	Thanks a lot, dude.
31438	Turk	What?
31439	J.D.	That Dan train used to hook up with Elliot.
31440	Turk	So?
31441	Herbert	So? Man, your boy J.D.'s been telling him that Elliot still likes him.
31442	J.D.	Doctor-patient confidentiality goes both ways, Mr. I-Prefer-My-Temperature-Taken-Through-the-Back-Door.
31443	Herbert	What? I mean it tickles.
31444	J.D.	Look, Dan doesn't exactly have the world by the tail, OK? Every time he calls me all depressed, the only thing I can think of to cheer him up was to say "Elliot still digs you." I'm just trying to find a way to make him feel good about himself, you know?
31445	Turk	If we have a boy, we're gonna name him George.
31446	J.D.	What about Tiger?
31447	Herbert	Hey, man, where'd your brother go, anyway?
31448	J.D.	Oh boy.
31449	J.D.	Call Elliot...call Elliot...No. N Call Elliot...got her...
31450	Elliot	We don't want any distractions while we're trying to make a baby.
31451	Keith	OK, you gotta stop saying that.
31452	Elliot	Keith, we're role-playing, all-right? This is not real, now let's just do this!
31453	Keith	All right.
31454	Elliot	Promise me you'll hold me like this when I'm pushing your baby out my bajingo?
31455	Keith	All right, I'm putting on a third condom.
31456	Elliot	Keith!
31457	Elliot	What?!
31458	Elliot	No, J.D., I'm not going to act like I want to bone your brother, I'm telling him the truth.
31459	Dan	Hey, Elliot's wearing lingerie.
31460	Elliot	Hey, Dan, J.D. told me you were coming. Um, this is Keith. I'm sure you're a little disappointed.
31461	Dan	Yeah, I'm in. I go first.
31462	Elliot	Yeah b- um...
31463	Keith	Elliot, you have to ask me about things like this.
31464	Elliot	And that is the father of my fake baby.
31465	Jordan	Ugh. I gotta go down to Jack's preschool. Apparently Seymour was teasing him, so he punched him in the face.
31466	Dr. Cox	Do Seymour's parents have to go down there?
31467	Jordan	I doubt it. They're turtles.
31468	Dr. Kelso	Count yourself lucky. My son just sent me a picture of himself sitting on the lap of his new boyfriend, Winston.
31469	Dr. Cox & Jordan	Huh.
31470	Jordan	Why are they dressed up as Tonto and the Lone Ranger?
31471	Dr. Kelso	Well I'd like to tell you they're going to a costume party, but apparently those are their jammies.
31472	Dr. Cox	Come on, look on the bright side. He is like the daughter that you never had, only gay and unsuccessful.
31473	Dr. Kelso	Ha! Tell me about it!
31474	Dr. Cox	It's so funny the way kids are, isn't it? Ha ha ha! You never know how it's going to go.
31475	J.D.'s Narration	Now that Dan knew that Elliot wasn't in to him, my focus had shifted from keeping him away from her, to avoiding him so he doesn't kill me.
31476	J.D.	Hey, Mr. Brooks, let's get these bandages off you.
31477	J.D.	What are you doing here?
31478	Janitor	Mr. Brooks wanted some safety tips on how to safely operate propane heaters.
31479	J.D.	As long as you're not my brother.
31480	Janitor	I had a brother once. Well, I shouldn't say once, he's still my brother. My parents adopted him when I was about 12. He was about 46. Actually older than my parents. His name was Cleat. And he talked like this. Howsitgoin? Howsitgoin? Good kid. Did what they said. Make the bed, mop the floor, sweep the lawn, whatever had to be done. Everything was good till he was in his fifties, and then, wow, did he have a midlife crisis. Him and my dad fought constantly. And I mean, really, physically beating on each other. But I don't blame him for it though. I blame my mom for sleeping with him. That's just out of line.
31481	J.D.	Yeah.
31482	Janitor	Anyway, the reason I'm telling you this is because your brother told me that if I could keep you focused on me, he would let me watch.
31483	J.D.	Watch what?
31484	Dan	Hey, little brother.
31485	J.D.	WAAAAHHH!!
31486	Carla	I can't believe those kids are playing with that dead guy's butt hamster.
31487	Turk	That is disgusting.
31488	Girl	It's my turn to hold Angie.
31489	Carla	What did she call that thing?
31490	Turk	Uh, baby, we should go.
31491	Carla	Ah-ah... Where did you come up with that name?
31492	J.D.	I guess I could help you name her. Let's see. It's a girl hamster, what about Angie?
31493	Girl	I love it!
31494	J.D.	Me too. Angie, guys?
31495	Kids	Yeah!
31496	J.D.	Angie it is.
31497	Turk	Hold his arms!
31498	J.D.	Wait, Turk, it was an accident, OK? The name just popped into my head!
31499	Turk	Shut up!! You just shut up right now! Pink belly.
31500	J.D.	No! Turk!
31501	J.D.'s Narration	Unfortunately, Turk was the greatest pink-bellyer in all the land.
31502	Dr. Cox	You know, Bobbo, I find you less repugnant as of late. Dare I say, I'm developing a begrudging indifference to you.
31503	Dr. Kelso	Ah, Perry, you're so edgy and cantakerous, you're like House without the limp.
31504	Dr. Cox	Ohh...
31505	Dr. Kelso	Ted, I've decided this project is over the head of the that pretty little lady, there, so Dr. Cox will replacing her.
31506	Claire	That was the longest three hours of my life.
31507	Ted	Call me!
31508	Ted	Tell you what she's not good at. Staring contests.
31509	Dr. Cox	Why, Bob?
31510	Dr. Kelso	Why the hell not?
31511	J.D.	So, Herbert, how you doing with your diet, man?
31512	Herbert	The best I could do, man. How's your tummy?
31513	J.D.	Uh, Turk was so proud of his handiwork that he signed it.
31514	J.D.	I think he knows it's so painful I won't be able to wash it for some time.
31515	Herbert	Hey, man, y'all two OK?
31516	J.D.'s Narration	Actually, we were. Because the way the whole brother thing works, now that Dan had beaten me up, it was all over.
31517	Dan	WHY DID YOU LIE TO ME ABOUT ELLIOT?!
31518	J.D.'s Narration	Or not.
31519	J.D.	Oh, come on, man, a girl like Elliot could never be into somebody like you.
31520	Dan	Why wouldn't she be into me?
31521	J.D.'s Narration	The obvious response was that Elliot was looking for a guy with more going on in his life. And the only way to gently break that to my brother was this:
31522	J.D.	Elliot wants to have kids right now, and she knows you're not ready.
31523	Dan	Ohhhhh...bummer.
31524	Herbert	Hey, man, don't worry about it, man, he bought it. It's cool.
31525	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
31526	Open	Hallway: J.D. is running through.
31527	J.D.'s Narration	I have to Elliot before my brother, Dan, does.
31528	Elliot	Herbert, I'm afraid your back pain might involve your spinal cord, so we need to get you an MRI. Now where is my pen?
31529	J.D.	Elliot! Elliot!
31530	Elliot	'Sup, J.D.?
31531	J.D.	My brother is on his way up. You have to tell him that the only reason you don't want to be with him is because he doesn't want kids right now.
31532	Elliot	J.D., just tell him the truth.
31533	J.D.	Elliot, the last time I was honest with Dan about his life it just made him feel like crap. And he didn't talk to me again until our dad died. Do you really want me to do that? Because I'm not sure what would get us back together this time. Dad can't die again.
31534	Dan	What's going on, guys?
31535	Dr. Cox	I am not having a staring contest with you, Ted.
31536	Ted	OK, one-nothing me, oh yeah. Yeah. OK, back to work. OK, this next patient claims their s-s-stent was implanted incorrectly. What's a stent?
31537	Dr. Cox	A tube that holds arteries open.
31538	Ted	All right. And, what's a Buckland?
31539	Dr. Cox	It's a predominantly hairless growth that is never found on women.
31540	Ted	Weird.
31541	Dr. Cox	It's your last name, Ted.
31542	Ted	Good one.
31543	Dan	So, uh, you got the baby fever, huh?
31544	Elliot	Yup, heh. Hopefully I'm already pregnant with Keith's child.
31545	Keith	Oh, come on! I'm 25 and I haven't even been to Europe!
31546	Elliot	Keith, wait!
31547	Dan	I got a good feeling about those two. Well, I'm off.
31548	J.D.	All right, man. Say hi to Mom for me.
31549	Dan	Yup. Get my stuff.
31550	J.D.'s Narration	And like that, he was gone.
31551	Turk	You know what name I've always liked for a girl? Honor.
31552	Carla	Turk, you know how mean boys are. They'd be all like "I got Honor, did you get Honor?"
31553	Turk	Yeah, everybody got Honor. She's easy.
31554	Carla	It's your daughter.
31555	Turk	Yes, it is.
31556	Carla	It's just weird. Angie was perfect, now nothing seems as good.
31557	Turk	What you got there, sir?
31558	Dr. Kelso	Dead hamster.
31559	Turk	Angie's dead? Baby, we got our name back!
31560	Carla	Yeah!
31561	Turk	Uh-huh!
31562	Janitor	Sir, if no one's officially called dibs?
31563	Dr. Kelso	Take it, freak.
31564	Janitor	What? I'm making a hamster vest for one of my squirrels.
31565	Jordan	What's going on?
31566	Ted	I love you too, dumpling, but I have to work late. I'll make it up to you this weekend.
31567	Dr. Cox	Ted's on the phone with his mom, so we're taking a five. Why? Why is Kelso doing this to me?
31568	Jordan	You know.
31569	Dr. Cox	No, I don't. All I remember is we were both making fun of our kids, and bam, he stuck me with Ted.
31570	Jordan	No, no. You made fun of your kid, he made fun of his kid, and then you made fun of *his kid.* Don't you get it?
31571	Jordan	You can never say bad things about someone else's kid. Ever.
31572	Ted	Mmm, if you can't reach that spot with the lotion, I'll get it for you when I get home late tonight. OK, kisses.
31573	Ted	You ready to get back in there?
31574	Dr. Cox	Yeah. I gotta vomit first.
31575	J.D.	OK, guys, let's all gather round, huddle up. Now, you guys, Herbert in there needs an MRI, but he won't fit into our machine. Does anybody know what we should do?
31576	J.D.'s Narration	Nobody wanted to say it, but sometimes when hospitals have Herbert-sized patients they'll send them to the one place that has MRI machines big enough: the zoo.
31577	J.D.	I know what you're all thinking, but I'm not going to do that to Herbert, it's too humiliating.
31578	Elliot	Herbert, you're too big for our MRI machine, so we're gonna have to take you to the zoo.
31579	Herbert	Damn. Well, that sucks.
31580	Elliot	You kinda brought this on yourself, didn't you?
31581	Herbert	Damn.
31582	J.D.	Why do you hate Herbert?
31583	Elliot	He's been in here seven times, all for weight related problems. I mean, he's never even tried to get healthier. Sometimes protecting someone's feelings isn't the best way to go.
31584	J.D.	Spare me the tough love speech, all right? You really think that going in there and being mean to Herbert is going to cause him to turn his life around and lose 100 pounds?
31585	Elliot	Probably not, but as long as I'm still in there trying to get him to change, then I can sleep at night. When you think about your brother later, how are you going to sleep?
31586	Carla	Angie and George.
31587	Turk	Mmm.
31588	Carla	Wow.
31589	Turk	You know what's weird?
31590	Carla	Hmm?
31591	Turk	Now that they have names, everything seems so real. I can see George's smile. And I can see Angie having your curly hair.
31592	Carla	I hope she doesn't have my ear infections.
31593	Carla	I was really sick as a baby.
31594	Turk	I was a climber. Our windows don't have bars on them. If George gets up there, he's falling right into the alley.
31595	Carla	What if George doesn't love me?
31596	Turk	What if Angie stops breathing in her sleep?
31597	Turk	Why did we have to pick these stupid names? I hate it when things get real!
31598	Carla	You know, when I was in high school, I had a shop teacher named George who hated black people.
31599	Turk	There was a prostitute at my town mall. Her name was Angie.
31600	Carla	Great, well, those names are out.
31601	Turk	Yeah, they're out!
31602	Carla	And we don't need new ones!
31603	Turk	We don't need new ones for nine months! I'm ready for bed.
31604	Carla	Me too.
31605	Turk	OK.
31606	Dr. Cox	Hey, Bob. You got a minute?
31607	Dr. Kelso	If you killed Ted, I don't want to know about it. Just make sure it's not traceable to the hospital.
31608	Dr. Cox	That's not why I'm here, but it's good to know. Look, uh, I just wanted to apologize for what I said about your son.
31609	Dr. Kelso	Well, he hasn't turned out exactly as I'd planned. For example, I always imagined we'd spend his thirteenth birthday fly-fishing in Montana.
31610	Dr. Cox	Where did you spend it?
31611	Dr. Kelso	On 42nd street, camped out for eight misbehaving tickets. He's a good kid though.
31612	Dr. Cox	Tell me about him.
31613	Dr. Kelso	He is a good kid. He's always been a good kid. And the first time I knew we weren't on the same page was when he took up knitting.
31614	Dr. Cox	Knitting?
31615	Dr. Kelso	Yeah, I thought he was gonna learn how to tie knots.
31616	J.D.	Hey, Dan?
31617	Dan	Hey, Johnnie. Just packing up. Thought you had to work?
31618	J.D.	I do, but I want to talk to you about something.
31619	Dan	Yeah, what's up?
31620	J.D.	Elliot doesn't want to have babies with Keith.
31621	Dan	Huh. Tough break for Keith. You know, I almost had a threesome with that guy.
31622	J.D.	When I said Elliot would never be into a guy like you, it's because you're a 35 year-old bartender who still lives in our mother's attic and is showing no signs of changing. I'm not saying this to make you feel bad, Dan, I'm telling you this because I think you have the potential to do whatever you want to do with your life. But you have to actually try.
31623	J.D.'s Narration	And then I got the answer I expected.
31624	Dan	Don't you have to get back to work?
31625	J.D.'s Narration	Even though I knew my brother wasn't going to change, Elliot was right. It comes down to what helps you sleep at night.
31626	Carla	Who are we kidding? This is so real now, there's no way we can sleep!
31627	J.D.'s Narration	Whether it's a sense of denial...
31628	J.D.'s Narration	...or the fact that you love your son.
31629	J.D.'s Narration	As for me, I was just happy to get some rest.
31630	J.D.	Hey.
31631	Dan	Hey, Johnnie, is it cool if I borrow this suit? I figured I might wear it to that job interview.
31632	J.D.	You know what, man, you might as well just keep it.
31633	Dan	Yeah, I'll keep it. Hey, uh, you think anyone would ever really hire me?
31634	J.D.	I think you can do whatever you want to do.
31635	Dan	Take it easy, little brother.
31636	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
31637	Open	Turk's and Carla's Apartment. J.D. is painting a mural on the wall.
31638	J.D.'s Narration	Turk and Carla were converting my old bedroom into a nursery, so I helped paint a mural for the new baby.
31639	Turk & J.D.	Done.
31640	Carla	Oh, hell no.
31641	Carla	Is that big, ugly one shooting laser beams into the crib?
31642	Turk	That's Optimus Prime, and I don't think he'd appreciate you calling him the big, ugly one.
31643	J.D.	No, he wouldn't.
31644	Turk	No, he wouldn't.
31645	J.D.	Not Optimus.
31646	Turk	Secondly, if Junior gets scared, he can always climb into bed with us. That's what I did with my mom.
31647	Carla	What do you mean "did?" J.D., last Christmas I walked in on Turk and his mom cuddling in bed.
31648	J.D.'s Narration	Turk gets defensive when it comes to his mother.
31649	Turk	I think you're just jealous because your mom's dead.
31650	J.D.	Whoa! We should probably take a break.
31651	Carla	No, no no no, you're going to finish building that crib like you promised, and you are driving to the cemetery, cleaning up my mom's grave and asking her for forgiveness.
31652	Turk	I hate having to ask for forgiveness.
31653	Carla	How's my mom doing?
31654	Turk	I asked her if she still hated me and the sprinklers came on.
31655	Carla	Give her time. She's only been dead for three years.
31656	Turk	But, baby, it's too soon to be putting a nursery together, or test driving minivans, or buying baby monitors.
31657	J.D.	I can't get this crib together. And would somebody please bring me a glass of water?
31658	Carla	You go this time.
31659	J.D.	Thank you.
31660	J.D.'s Narration	Thinking about Turk and Carla becoming parents made me think about my own mom, and how much she probably misses me. I bet she wishes she could see what life is like around here through my eyes.
31661	J.D.'s Narration	And that's why I strapped my video camera on top of my head.
31662	Lonnie	Morning, weirdo.
31663	J.D.	Lonnie.
31664	J.D.'s Narration	It was the perfect idea. She got to meet my superiors.
31665	Dr. Kelso	Sorry, the old man stole some ice cream.
31666	J.D.'s Narration	I even got some great footage of Dr. Cox.
31667	Dr. Cox	Where the hell have you been?
31668	J.D.	I'm making a video postcard. Do you have a message for my mom?
31669	Dr. Cox	No, but since she brought you into this world, I have a message for her uterus.
31670	Dr. Cox	Bad uterus! Don't do that anymore.
31671	J.D.	She had a hysterectomy last month. I'm sure I can just edit over that part.
31672	Dr. Cox	Let's go see Mr. McNair.
31673	J.D.'s Narration	Mr. McNair had locked-in syndrome. A paralysis so severe that he could only communicate through a computer that responds to his eye movements.
31674	Dr. Cox	Check his vitals, Ava.
31675	Mr. McNair	Why does he call you a girl's name?
31676	J.D.	Oh, thank you for asking, Mr. MacNair. You see, the thing about Dr. Cox is the closer he feels to a person, the more he means to push them away. So when he calls me Ava, he's actually saying "J.D., I care about you." Vulnerable people, like...
31677	Mr. McNair	Oh my God. I get it now. Carol...Carol...Carol...Carol...Carol...
31678	J.D.	Now you're being a jerk...jerk...jerk...jerk! JERK!
31679	Dr. Cox	Newbie!
31680	J.D.	What?
31681	Dr. Cox	I'm relatively certain the computer is broken.
31682	J.D.	My bad.
31683	J.D.	I felt bad for Mr. McNair, but I was off until six tonight, so I decided to grab a quick nap in the sun.
31684	J.D.	What the...whoa!

31686	Open	Admissions Area.
31687	Turk	Where the hell is J.D.?
31688	Carla	He's off until six.
31689	Turk	You know any second now he's going to come walking through that door all lost in his thoughts.
31690	Janitor's Thoughts	With Dorian taken care of, I'm not sure how I should spend my day. I suppose I could clean. Hee hee hee, God, help me, that one still makes me laugh. Oh, no. It's Black Kojak and Scary Nurse Wife. I'll get rid of them with an innocuous compliment.
31691	Janitor	You are glowing.
31692	Janitor's Thoughts	Free and clear.
31693	Turk	Have you seen J.D.?
31694	J.D.	Where am I? Hello? Anyone?
31695	Janitor	No. Don't know where he is.
31696	Janitor's Thoughts	Man, I love that adrenaline rush you get from lying to someone's face. Do it again!
31697	Janitor	Dr. Kelso, I must say, your nose hairs are not the least bit long and creepy like most old guys.
31698	Dr. Kelso	Thank you.
31699	Dr. Kelso	Hey, Perry, great shirt! I wish I'd thought of athletic apparel when I went through my mid-life crisis. It would have been a hell of a lot less expensive than a cigarette boat named "Dr. Feelgood."
31700	Dr. Cox	That laughing had better not be aimed in my direction, bro.
31701	Turk	"Bro?" Dude, bros don't even use "bro." You're not as hip as you think you are.
31702	Dr. Cox	And you are?
31703	Turk	I'm black. God knew my people would go through some struggles, so He gave us a lifetime supply of cool to compensate. Just like He knew white people would be rhythmically challenged, so He gave y'all this dance.
31704	Dr. Cox	You're black? Because last I checked, you had a nerdy, white best friend, you enjoy Neil Diamond and you damn sure act like a black guy, and these, my friend, are all characteristics of a white guy. Please understand, I'm a big supporter of the NAACP, and if you don't know that stands for, it is the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. And quite frankly, I always thought they should change the "Colored People" to "African Americans" but then, of course, it wouldn't be the NAACP. It would be the N-Quad-A, or NAAAA, and I know this probably sounds like digression, but it actually leads me back to my original point. Do I think you're black? NAAAAAAHH!
31705	Nurse	Knock, knock!
31706	Janitor's Thoughts	Who's there? Nurse Mophead. Nurse Mophead, who? You have a mophead.
31707	Nurse	Well, your new computer should be here tonight.
31708	Janitor	She got out of here in a hurry, didn't she? I know what that's like, when people just say the bare minimum to you. But with me, it's usually "mop that floor," "clean that counter," "stop provoking that bear." Want me to keep you company? I mean, I don't mind. I'm just working on my own stuff anyway.
31709	Janitor	I'm a bit of an inventor. Let me show you my latest one. Pen straw.
31710	Janitor	Perfect. Except I don't like that cola. Tastes like ink. But that's just one. I got a million ideas.
31711	Elliot	I don't care if you're on the first floor. I need this cleaned up right now!
31712	Janitor	I'm here! Time to open up the window!
31713	Elliot	That was quick.
31714	Janitor	I call it the Hover Hoover. Where suction meets the sky.
31715	Elliot	That's a very good question. It's just the problem is that I've already answered it five times.
31716	Dr. Kelso	Dr. Reid, would you mind explaining why you called the chief of surgery to consult on a cellulitis patient yesterday?
31717	Elliot	I wasn't even here yesterday.
31718	Dr. Kelso	Yeah, but your interns were. And their mistakes are your mistakes. Whether it's an unnecessary consult or that young man's ridiculous haircut.
31719	Intern	This cost 60 dollars.
31720	Dr. Kelso	Let's hope your stylist put that money towards rehab.
31721	Elliot	Darn it, you guys, I'm sick and tired of all your careless mistakes. Lisa, why isn't this GI bleeder on telemetry? And, Keith, I know that you had a twelve hour shift yesterday, put that is no excuse for not turning in your patient histories.
31722	Keith	Elliot, you dragged me to dinner and then made me play Scrabble all night.
31723	Elliot	How you spend your private life isn't my responsibility, OK?
31724	Keith	Fine, I'll do them tonight.
31725	Elliot	Oh, you can't. You're taking me to the movies. Get on the ball, Keith! All of you, go work.
31726	Carla	Wow. Aren't you the big, bad-ass attending?
31727	Elliot	Yeah, well, it's time for them to sink or swim. I got to where I am on my own, OK?
31728	Carla	Nobody helped you out in the beginning, huh?
31729	Elliot	Dr. Cox was my attending. He was nice enough to keep track of the number of times he made me cry.
31730	Dr. Cox	27, counting this morning.
31731	Elliot	Hm. Yeah, I'm PMS-ing and he made fun of my shoes.
31732	Dr. Cox	Laverne? What are you doing out here?
31733	Laverne	Well, tonight's date night with Mr. Roberts, and I like to prime the pump by watching the young men sweat.
31734	Dr. Cox	Uh-huh.
31735	Turk	Hey, Dr. Cox, if I wasn't a black man, could I do this?
31736	Turk	That's game, all right? That's game. You got next?
31737	Dr. Cox	Yeah, I got next.
31738	Turk	Well, I should warn you, they call me the candy man because my moves are so sweet.
31739	Todd	Yeah, and they call me the pig because I say sexist and derogatory things to women.
31740	Laverne	Lonnie! Play with Dr. Cox.
31741	Lonnie	Let's go!
31742	Turk	HA! Look at the glasses! Look at the mouthpiece!
31743	Laverne	Dr. Turk is not aware the Lonnie was All-Conference at Villanova.
31744	Dr. Cox	Laverne, would you go ahead and thank what's-his-name for me?
31745	Laverne	Jesus?
31746	Dr. Cox	That's him. Let's go!
31747	Turk	Check ball.
31748	Carla	Lisa, why did you order 100 units of insulin for Mrs. Best?
31749	Lisa	No, that's only 10 units. I just put a smiley face after the zero.
31750	Carla	Look, Lisa, you have to be crystal clear with your medical orders.
31751	Carla	OK, it's causing a bit of a seizure. Hey, Janitor! Come here, would you hold her legs down, please!
31752	Janitor's Thoughts	This is it. I'm in the show! Dr. Jan Itor!
31753	Carla	I'll give her an amp of E 50.
31754	Janitor	This is easy. It's just like drowning someone.
31755	Carla	OK, you can let her legs go now, I think we're good.
31756	Janitor	I didn't see the demon leave the body.
31757	Carla	I'm sure it did. Hey, Janitor, good job.
31758	Janitor	Good job.
31759	Lisa	Dr. Reid will kill me when she finds out about this.
31760	Carla	Relax, I'll go talk to Dr. Reid. It won't be a big deal.
31761	Elliot	What?! Oh, I'm gonna make someone burn for this. Who did it, Carla?
31762	Janitor	I guess I just never knew how much I picked up just from working here, you know? I heard her yell "hold this woman's legs down!" And instinctively, I just I knew what to do.
31763	Laverne	Good for you. Now I have to go meet my husband at the bus station and pretend to be a street walker.
31764	Janitor	Enjoy your date night!
31765	Janitor's Thoughts	OK, Mr. Cool-Guy. You had your moment of glory, no need to make a big deal out of it.
31766	Janitor	Hey!
31767	Janitor	Slow down, buddy, what's the hurry? Come here. I'm gonna tell you a little story about a hero.
31768	Janitor's Thoughts	You know what? The hell with it. It feels good to get a little attention.
31769	Janitor's Narration	I'll tell you one thing. It's sure beats falling flat on your ass...
31770	Dr. Cox	Holy Moley! That'd be really embarrassing if you were black! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
31771	Turk	Great.
31772	Elliot	Seriously, Carla, I need to know who's responsible for this.
31773	Janitor's Narration	...Or lying to cover someone's ass.
31774	Carla	I don't know. It was just a clerical error. There's no way to trace it.
31775	Janitor	Was I brave? Brave is a strong word. Perhaps the word is valiant. Off you go.
31776	Janitor's Narration	Anyway, for once I didn't feel like a jerk.
31777	Nurse	Is he still talking about holding that patient's legs?
31778	Doctor	Oh, give him a break. You know how hard it is to come here and bust our humps every day? Imagine how hard it is to come here knowing you don't make a difference.

31781	Janitor	Drill fork. It's a drill and fork. Mostly fork. You know what, I don't care what those people said. I know I make a difference around here.
31782	Doctor	Hey, Jill.
31783	Janitor	They don't know how different it would be if I wasn't here.
31784	Doctor	Hey, Jill.
31785	Janitor	Yup. A lot of lives would change. In fact, I'm gonna prove that to them right now. I am going to fix your computer. I've just gotta go get my real tools. I've turned all of these into eating utensils. Dig in.
31786	Dr. Kelso	Do you know what time it is?
31787	Janitor's Thoughts	4:15.
31788	Janitor	3:30.
31789	Dr. Kelso	Oh, thank goodness, I thought I was running late.
31790	Janitor's Thoughts	I do love to lie.
31791	Elliot	Look at my face. Keith, what does it mean when I'm frowning?
31792	Keith	That you're feeling insecure and you're suspicious that I think someone on television is prettier than you.
31793	Elliot	At work, Keith.
31794	Keith	Ah t
31795	Elliot	Well, Keith was half-right. This face does mean that I am suspicious. I was reviewing the medical records and I realized that Mrs. Best received an inordinate amount of insulin and I wanna know who screwed up.
31796	Carla	Elliot?
31797	Carla	You're wasting your time, you know how interns stick together. They're never going to rat each other out.
31798	Elliot	What you're forgetting, Carla, is that I am sleeping with one of those interns. Now seeing that I've already gotten Keith to pee sitting down so that there's absolutely no chance of seat splatter, I'm betting that I'm probably going to be able to get them to talk. Keith! Meet me in the cafe in half an hour.
31799	Carla	Keith, you better not tell her who did it.
31800	Keith	But Elliot scares me.
31801	Carla	Elliot is a blonde, 108-pound ski-pole from a cul-de-sac in Connecticut. I am an underpaid, pregnant nurse from the block, who, over the next six months, will become fatter and angrier. Now who are you really afraid of?
31802	Keith	The fatty.
31803	Carla	Be careful, Keith.
31804	Carla	Oh, I love it. And you know, they say it's the safest thing we can do for our baby. Can we get it?
31805	Turk	No. No, no, no, let's get back before someone sees it, matter of fact, get down! Scoot down!
31806	Carla	Hey!
31807	Dr. Cox	Hello, that's a nice ride, huh, Dexter?
31808	Dr. Cox	I hate to bother you, but, uh, could you explain to me one more time, what's it like to be a young, hip, black guy?
31809	Turk	See, Dr. Cox, what I'ma do, is we gonn' pimp dis out. We gonn' throw some 22's on it, put some spinners on the 22's...
31810	Carla	Oh! And a DVD player so the kids can watch Elmo!
31811	Turk	You're killing me, woman.
31812	Janitor's Narration	Sometimes around here, it feels like humiliation is contagious.
31813	Dr. Cox	Whoo!
31814	Janitor	Mr. McNair, I didn't exactly fix your computer. I think I might have voided your warranty.
31815	Keith	Elliot, I am not going to tell you who messed up with Mrs. Best.
31816	Elliot	Ah, no problem. I just wanted to grab a cup of coffee. Oh, and introduce you to my mom.
31817	Mrs. Reid	Ha, "mom." That makes me sound so old. I had C-sections with all my kids, so everything is as it was down there.
31818	Keith	Uh, very nice to meet you, Mrs. Reid.
31819	Mrs. Reid	You and Elliot would have such cute babies. I keep telling her, she's only got five more years to pop one out. Have you ever seen chubby Elliot?
31820	Keith	Uh, no.
31821	Mrs. Reid	Well, if you want to see it, just break up with her and wait a couple of weeks. When she's depressed, she hits a bag of Doritos like there's diamonds at the bottom.
31822	Elliot	Hmm, love you too, Mom.
31823	Mrs. Reid	Ah! That's your dad. How'd you get this number?
31824	Elliot	You like her? Because if you don't tell me which intern screwed up, I'm going to beg her to move here.
31825	Keith	She's just a little weird, Elliot. I can handle weird.
31826	Mrs. Reid	I'm sorry, the light just hit you so perfectly. I had to have a taste. No, not you.
31827	Keith	It was Lisa. I would have told you earlier, but someone told me not to.
31828	Elliot	Who told you not to?
31829	Carla	Baby, you're not really bothered by what Dr. Cox said, are you? You know you're my black prince!
31830	Turk	Baby, that's not it. I know I'm black, I'm reminded all the time. Patient doesn't want a black doctor, people think I know the score to every NBA game, and I told you what happened last week, when the new board member met the surgical staff.
31831	Board Member	Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Hey, what up, dog? Nice to meet you.
31832	Turk	It's not even about that. It's about the nursery. It's about that stupid minivan. I don't know if you know this, but overnight I went from Chris Turk Stud to Grandpa Turk. The guy who wears overalls and does embarrassing dances at cookouts.
31833	Carla	you do that now.
31834	Turk	But in a cool way.
31835	Dr. Kelso	Hey. Thanks to your telling me the wrong time prank, I was 45 minutes late for my oriental massage. Which meant that instead of Pang Wa, I had to settle for Qing Lao.
31836	Janitor	So?
31837	Dr. Kelso	Qing Lao is A DUDE! You know, I've accepted the fact that you're useless around here. Maybe you should try a little harder and not make things worse.
31838	Janitor	See you know he doesn't get, is that I could have been a janitor anywhere. When I got out of college, I had offers, man. Morgan Stanley, DuPont. I even considered taking a year off and cleaning my way across Europe. But no, I chose a hospital. And I'm no kidding myself. I know I don't have the most important job in the world, but I work in a place that helps people, and I always thought that I was part of that. Who cares?
31839	Elliot	Have you seen Carla?
31840	Dr. Cox	Nope. My turn. Have ever seen how stupid you look when you do your angry-quick walk?
31841	Elliot	Carla covered for one of my interns and then lied to my face about it.
31842	Dr. Cox	Come on. Of course she did. If an intern got hammered by their attending and stripped what little self-confidence they have every time they messed up, there wouldn't be any interns left. And lucky for everyone in this dump, Carla happens to have been here long enough to identify when someone needs to be protected.
31843	Elliot	These kids need to start standing on their own...
31844	Dr. Cox	You got that right sister, because you definitely got where you are all on your own.
31845	Elliot	Well you sure as hell didn't give me any help.
31846	Dr. Cox	I didn't say I did.
31847	Carla	It's OK, really. It's not a big deal.
31848	Elliot	Dr. Cox is going to kill me.
31849	Carla	Well, Dr. Cox doesn't have to find out. Just promise me that you're going to practice repositioning just once.
31850	Elliot	I promise.
31851	Carla	OK.
31852	Carla	Turk, I get it. Having a baby changes things.
31853	Turk	I just don't want to say goodbye to the life we have now, you know?
31854	Carla	Baby, you don't have to. We'll still have fun. Go to bars, go dancing.
31855	Turk	Really?
31856	Carla	No. We'll have a baby, that would be crazy. Just focus on the positives. For instance, we'll still have lots of sex.
31857	Turk	Really?
31858	Carla	No! But I can tell you that this is normal. You'll get through it.
31859	Turk	Come to think of it, what would really help me get through it...
31860	Carla	Man you're gullible today.
31861	Janitor	Well, Mr. McNair, hope you didn't mind me hanging out all day talking to you. I don't think you do mind. I've got a seventh sense about that sort of thing. My sixth sense is I can tell when squirrels are afraid. Anyway, I know you lost your computer and I thought maybe you were a little bit lonely. I've been lonely around here a couple times. I don't know. I just hope I helped.
31862	Dr. Cox	Nobody's buying it. Here we go, your new computer is finally here, sorry it took so long.
31863	Janitor	What time is it?
31864	Dr. Cox	Uh, 6:00.
31865	J.D.	WAAAHHH!
31866	Janitor	How was your day?
31867	J.D.	Cold.
31868	Janitor's Thoughts	Now help him up so he thinks there's hope for our relationship yet.
31869	J.D.'s Narration	Even though the Janitor had basically kidnapped me, when he helped me up, I couldn't help but feel there was hope for our relationship yet. I guess being locked up all day really make you appreciate the things that really matter...
31870	Elliot	Hey, did I ever thank you for all the help you've given me over the years?
31871	Carla	Don't sweat it.
31872	J.D's Narration	...Like the support of a friend...
31873	Turk	What up, dawg? Yeah, you know I'm down to play ball, I just gotta drop Junior off with the old lady at the ducky park. Yeah. Yeah, then we gonn' hoop it up. Hey, you know what, this isn't gonna work. I can't, I can't.
31874	Dr. Cox	And there you go, Mr. McNair.
31875	Mr. McNair	Thank you.
31876	Dr. Cox	Don't mention it.
31877	Mr. McNair	I wasn't talking to you.
31878	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
31879	Open	Hallway. J.D. enters, heading towards the Nurses' Station with a cardboard box. He passes Todd, waiting around the corner.
31880	J.D.	Todd, what are you doing?
31881	Todd	Waiting for my moment.
31882	J.D.'s Narration	OK, moving on. It was time for my new daily ritual: asking Dr. Cox to lunch.
31883	J.D.	Hey, Dr. Cox, what are you doing for lunch?
31884	Dr. Cox	Not having it with you, Paula.
31885	J.D.	Oh, good luck eating. This is every spoon from the cafeteria. And guess what? Today just happens to be soup and frozen yogurt day.
31886	Elliot	Ooh! I'm gonna have, uh, tomato and strawberry.
31887	Dr. Cox	Lunch for us, not going to happen. Normally, I'd tell you something harsh right about now, like "we're not friends," but then you'll just grin that stupid grin and shake your head back and forth, like "how could that possibly be true?"
31888	J.D.	Because it's ludicrous.
31889	Dr. Cox	Ah, just give me a spoon, will you please?
31890	Dr. Cox	Oh, for goodness sake.
31891	J.D.	You called my bluff, and today isn't soup and frozen yogurt day, it's actually salad and smoothie day.
31892	Elliot	I'm still having tomato and strawberry.
31893	Carla	I'm having a weird pregnancy craving. Hey, J.D., if you go out, would you give me a hot Italian sausage?
31894	Todd	I got a hot Italian sausage for you right here! People think I just luck into these situations, but it's really a lot of hard work. You know what else is hard? I should go.
31895	J.D.	I think I may vomit.
31896	J.D.'s Narration	Some doctors like to change into their streets when they go out for lunch. Not me. I like how the world reacts to me as a doctor. Whether it's a friendly greeting from the world's slowest bagger...
31897	World's Slowest Bagger	Hey there, Dr. Dorian.
31898	J.D.	Lookin' good pal, eggs on top, OK? Eggs on top.
31899	J.D.'s Narration	...Or a smile from the manager of the herbal section.
31900	J.D.	Hey, Rebecca, you got that echinacea for me? Just kidding, you know I think all this stuff is voodoo. Good to see you. Hey, looks like somebody else is sick of that cafeteria stuff, huh?
31901	Dr. Cox	Aw, now what the hell, do you follow me here?
31902	J.D.	A friend dropped me off.
31903	J.D.	EAGLE!
31904	J.D.	Hey, wanna go splitsies on some deli counter meatloaf? I can't finish a whole serving. I mean I can, but I don't like to. It all goes right here.
31905	Dr. Cox	God, could this be any more of a nightmare?
31906	Jill	Guys!
31907	J.D.'s Narration	Yes, it could be more of a nightmare. Jill Tracy was a former patient who had once tried to kill herself. Sad, yes, but this did not change the fact that she was unbelievably annoying.
31908	Jill	Oh my God, what are you doing here? I was supposed to meet a guy for a date. I know what you're thinking, a Tuesday lunch date at the supermarket? He is so not into her. Well guess what? He's not!
31909	Jill	I waited for an hour just thinking "how many more guys from my yoga class can reject me before just saying enough,"
31910	J.D.	Oh, we have to get back to the hospital.
31911	Jill	Bummer. Trail mix! Arrarrarr! Ha, I'm just kidding, I won't. Oh, stop, I'll have some.
31912	Dr. Cox	You know what, Newbie, stay. Have lunch.
31913	J.D.	One of those emergencies, I should probably go, too. How are things?
31914	Jill	Mmm...
31915	Rebecca	You know that's stealing.
31916	J.D.	Oh, come on, Rebecca, everybody's doing it.
31917	J.D.	I won't tell anyone if you don't.
31918	Rebecca	Security!
31919	J.D.	Security?
31920	Rebecca	We've got a grazer.
31921	J.D.	I don't think there's a security force at...
31922	J.D.	OK, hey fellas.
31923	Jill	Ha ha! Wherever you're taking him, take me, too! Nah, you go ahead.
31924	J.D.	Where's the shaving cream, is that aisle two, still?
31925	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
31926	Open	Hallway. J.D. walks through.
31927	J.D.'s Narration	Today was a busy day at Sacred Heart.
31928	J.D.'s Narration	We had three separate patients waiting for transplants. And we were doing everything we could to keep them alive until we could locate donors. There was Mrs. Sikes, who needed a new liver. There was Mr. Dennison, who needed a new heart valve. And then there was Dr. Cox's guy, Dave Bradford.
31929	Dr. Cox	So, now, Davey-boy, I promise you, we're going to find you a kidney. I would literally swear on my father's grave, but whenever I go there, I usually just end up dancing on it.
31930	Mr. Bradford	And so begins another round of "who had the worst dad." One of my pop's nicknames for me was Sparky, because he liked to light matches off my neck.
31931	Dr. Cox	We've been over this before. You win on account of your father's not dead yet.
31932	J.D.'s Narration	Most doctors stressed with so many people clinging to life. Dr. Cox vibed on it.
31933	Dr. Cox	As I lie in bed each morning and ask myself why I should put both feet on the floor, there are precious few reasons that I've ever been able to come up with. A chance to escape Jordan's morning breath? Sure. Scotch! It's too early to drink it, yes, but people, it is never too early to think about. And of course, the ever present possibility that I might finally happen upon Hugh Jackman and be able to give him the present that I've been holding for him.
31934	Dr. Cox	BAM! Still, the most persuasive argument I've ever been able to come up with is the fact that I get to come here, to this hospital, every day and help keep people alive.
31935	Turk	That's ironic, because four people just died while you were talking.
31936	Elliot	Look, we need to keep these people going until we can find donors.
31937	Dr. Cox	All right, Barbie, go check on Mrs. Sikes' ammonia levels, she's encephalopathic.
31938	Dr. Cox	Gandhi, review Dennison's chart and get me a consent.
31939	Dr. Cox	Bobbo! Get on the horn to cronies at local hospitals and get me a donor update.
31940	Dr. Kelso	Fine, some of the boys are coming over tonight anyway, I'll bring it up to Morrison while he sets up the projector for the stag flicks.
31941	Dr. Cox	Just the organs, Bob, don't need the visual of old men with erections.
31942	Carla	And now it's in my head forever.
31943	Dr. Cox	Sorry, go step up Davey's dialysis to take your mind off of it.
31944	Dr. Cox	Newbie, you feel like a sandwich?
31945	J.D.	I do feel like a sandwich.
31946	Dr. Cox	You feel more like a pastry, a very doughy pastry. I don't feel good about that. Way too easy.
31947	J.D.'s Narration	I had one objective: Pick up everyone's lunch at the grocery store and get out of dodge.
31948	J.D.	Whoa!
31949	Jill	J.D.!
31950	J.D.	Hey, Jill.
31951	Jill	How weird is it that we're both here two days in a row?
31952	J.D.	Mmm.
31953	Jill	I was thinking there might be a 50% chance that the guy who blew me off yesterday just got his days wrong and would be waiting here with roses. Is that sad?
31954	J.D.	It's not not sad.
31955	Jill	Plus I have the whole day free. My shrink couldn't make our appointment. He found his third wife in bed with his second wife and got so depressed that he downed an entire bottle of his bulimic daughter's Prozac. So now he's back in the hospital.
31956	J.D.	That's an awesome story, Jill.
31957	Jill	It's true, heh hee hee.
31958	Elliot	Hey, what did you do last night?
31959	Carla	Turk made me watch Anaconda with him.
31960	Elliot	Oh, is that the one with the giant snake?
31961	Todd	No, this is the one with the giant snake. I was back here for 45 minutes waiting for a setup. My back is killing me. But I nailed it. It's about commitment.
31962	Carla	Hey, how could your intern used to sleep with him?
31963	Elliot	She's a tramp with no morals.
31964	Lisa	I never slept with the Todd.
31965	Elliot	Lisa is sweet and people just don't give her a chance.
31966	Carla	I wonder who else Todd lied about sleeping with.
31967	Nurse #1	I didn't sleep with him.
31968	Nurse #2	God no.
31969	Nurse #3	Are you kidding me?
31970	Gloria	Todd, is he the big, black security guard with the hook hand?
31971	Elliot	Uh, no.
31972	Gloria	Then no.
31973	Mr. Bradford	So I am I ever getting out of here?
31974	Dr. Cox	We haven't found you a kidney yet, but I have some ideas.
31975	Mr. Bradford	Yeah, this will do.
31976	J.D.	Ah, what the hell. I can live with one kidney.
31977	Dr. Cox	Because we'll probably just go ahead and sell this one.
31978	J.D.	Stay away from my organs!
31979	Turk	Dude, what the hell are you doing?
31980	J.D.	Having lunch. The cafeteria stinks and I can't go to the grocery store because apparently crazy Jill Tracy lives there. Every time I try and shop she follows me around, like I'm her only friend in the world. It's pathetic.
31981	Turk	I'm gonna go talk to Carla.
31982	J.D.	I'll come, too.
31983	Turk	Figured.
31984	Carla	Hey, why do you think Todd lies about hooking up with all those women?
31985	Elliot	Maybe he's just overcompensating. You know, my brother, Barry, used to brag about all the girls he was dating, right before he quit JV baseball and started dancing for Japanese businessmen.
31986	Turk	Todd's not gay.
31987	Carla	Turk, he has leather jeans in, like, three different colors.
31988	Elliot	Barry used to dance in leather jeans. He'd come home and they'd be stuffed with yen.
31989	Janitor	I'll tell you when I first suspected he was gay. It was very subtly, but...
31990	J.D.	Oh, yeah, Dale, this is totally going to bring out your pecs. Plus, I'm using olive oil so I can lick it off later. Make 'em dance!
31991	J.D.	Oh, they're dancing! Somebody's making them dance! Whooo-wee!
31992	J.D.	Tell them it never happened!
31993	Janitor	It happened. I was there.
31994	Dr. Cox	I think I just got the move on signal from a hook.
31995	Elliot, Turk & Carla	Mmhmm.
31996	Dr. Cox	Anyway, give me the update here.
31997	Carla	Your guy Bradford's electrolyte and fluid balance are stable.
31998	Turk	Mr. Dennison isn't looking so good. He's on max inotropes and still in failure.
31999	Elliot	Mrs. Sikes is fully encephalopathic. Her ammonium level's through the roof. She's circling the drain.
32000	Dr. Cox	Come on, now, let's try to keep these people alive. What do you say?
32001	Lisa	Dr. Dorian? Can you help me?
32002	J.D.	Sure, what's going on?
32003	Lisa	She was admitted a short time ago and she hasn't regained consciousness. Tox screen's positive for cocaine.
32004	Lisa	Do you think she could have OD'd?
32005	J.D.	She had been, uh, stood up on a couple dates. And, uh, she hadn't seen her shrink in a while. She was definitely depressed.
32006	Lisa	How do you know all that?
32007	J.D.	She told me.
32008	J.D.'s Narration	In hospitals, there are certain rules.
32009	J.D.'s Narration	With surgeons, if the overcompensating, pumped-up, shaved-down doctor seems gay...
32010	Turk	'Sup, man, you trying a new workout?
32011	Todd	No, why?
32012	Todd	Oh, he's glistening.
32013	J.D.'s Narration	...He's probably gay.
32014	J.D.'s Narration	And if there's good news for one doctor...
32015	Dr. Cox	People, I've got our organs.
32016	J.D.'s Narration	...It probably means bad news for another.
32017	Mrs. Tracy	You can use her organs.
32018	J.D.	Thank you.
32019	Mrs. Tracy	Just tell me this: Is there anything anyone could have done?
32020	J.D.	No.
32021	J.D.'s Thoughts	Unless you mean me.
32022	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
32023	Open	ICU. J.D. enters.
32024	J.D.'s Narration	It's amazing how quickly people improve once they get a new organ. Whether it's Mrs. Sikes, with her new liver, Mr. Dennison, with his new heart valve, or Dave.
32025	Dr. Cox	How, uh, how does that new kidney feel, huh?
32026	Mr. Bradford	It's a little loose. But I'll get used to it.
32027	Dr. Cox	Yeah you will.
32028	Mr. Bradford	Hey, thanks for everything, man.
32029	Dr. Cox	Don't sweat it.
32030	Dr. Cox	All right, people, gather round, here we go. Now, I'm sure we all recognize how rare it is to get a win like this, but seeing as we're surrounding by patients who are clinging to life, I'm going to give kudos in whisper form. And since I am an egomaniac, first props come to me. Let me hear it, people.
32031	Turk	You are some kind of superhero.
32032	Carla	You're a god.
32033	Elliot	You're a beautiful healer.
32034	Dr. Cox	This was not a complete and total solo effort. It was an extraordinary job done by each and every one of you.
32035	Dr. Kelso	I can't hear a word he's saying.
32036	Dr. Cox	Be older, Bob.
32037	Dr. Kelso	Oh, just because I can't hear your silly-ass whispering, it doesn't mean I'm old. Matter of fact, I'm going over to my office to tinker with my new computer.
32038	Turk	Ooh, what kind is it?
32039	Dr. Kelso	It's about 3:30. Ha ha ha ha! I heard what he said, people, but damn that joke's a classic.
32040	Dr. Cox	And why are you not giddy with praise, like those other people? Don't you know I dole out compliments at most once a year? And like a squirrel, you must gather these acorns of kind words to sustain you for the upcoming cold, sarcastic months.
32041	J.D.	Any idiot could have seen that Jill was in trouble. I'm supposed to be a doctor, and I'm the reason she's dead.
32042	J.D.'s Narration	Then he said the words I never expected to hear.
32043	Dr. Cox	Why don't you and I go grab some lunch. That'd be good. Come on.
32044	Elliot	Oh, my God, he looks so sad.
32045	Carla	I just want to hold him like a big, gay baby.
32046	Turk	Ugh, this is incredible. An hour ago, you guys hated him.
32047	Carla	An hour he wasn't our new, gay best friend.
32048	Turk	Leave the Todd alone, OK? Because every time you two meddle, you know who suffers? Me. Remember when the Janitor took that chiropractic class and you guys wanted to encourage him?
32049	Turk	Guys, uh, I'm really not comfortable with this.
32050	Janitor	Now, now, you'll be fine. I've already done this on four mop heads, all right? Haven't had a complaint yet.
32051	Janitor	OK.
32052	Turk	Oh.
32053	Janitor	On three. One, two...
32054	Turk	AAAHH!
32055	Janitor	Better? Yes?
32056	Turk	WWAAAAAAHHAAAHAHAHAHAAAAA!!
32057	Elliot	You're fine. We're doing this.
32058	Janitor	I can fix that, buddy. On the count of three. One, two...
32059	Turk	Ooohh!
32060	Janitor	Yeah?
32061	Turk	No.
32062	Janitor	You owe me 500 dollars.
32063	Surveyor	Excuse me, could you spare a few minutes for AIDS research?
32064	Dr. Cox	Yes, I can, but I'm not sure just how much we'll get done. I tell you what. We'll go over here and brainstorm while we wolf down these sandwiches. Newbie, come.
32065	J.D.'s Thoughts	Vintage Cox.
32066	J.D.	You know what I was thinking the whole time I was havig lunch with Jill?
32067	Dr. Cox	What's that?
32068	J.D.	God, this girl's annoying.
32069	Dr. Cox	I saw her in that supermarket, too, but I'm not torturing myself. Would you like to know why?
32070	J.D.	Why?
32071	Dr. Cox	Because she didn't come to the hospital looking for help. We just randomly bumped into her out here in the world. I mean, don't get me wrong, if a guy gets shot, or if he has a heart attack and I am physically the closest doctor to him, I will intervene. But shy of that, you can't. I mean, you just can't. It's too much to ask of yourself.
32072	J.D.	OK, I hear you.
32073	Dr. Cox	No, you don't. Once you start blaming yourself for deaths that aren't your fault, my friend, that's a slippery slope that you can't come back from. And trust me, I've seen it ruin a hell of a lot of good doctors and I will not let it happen to you.
32074	J.D.'s Narration	And because he said that, I knew it wouldn't.
32075	Elliot	Game time. Let's go.
32076	Carla	Todd? Do you have a second?
32077	Todd	I was actually on my way to the gym.
32078	Carla	That's kind of what it's about.
32079	Todd	Whoa. Did something happen to the gym? Don't lie to me.
32080	Elliot	We know about your...
32081	Carla	...Situation.
32082	Elliot	You are hiding from yourself.
32083	Carla	Stop hiding, Todd.
32084	Elliot	We accept you.
32085	Carla	No matter who you love.
32086	Todd	The Todd's confused.
32087	Elliot	He was like a little baby. Ah ha, well you were wrong. It went great. I mean, at first, the Todd was a little emotional, but by the end of it, he was saying how happy he was that he didn't have to lie. And then he French-braided my hair, and then took it out because he said I could not pull it off. Oh, he is so honest.
32088	Carla	It was great, it was like he changed into a whole new person. God, how awesome is it gonna be without that inappropriate pig wandering the halls anymore?
32089	Todd	Hey, Mickhead? Is that package for me? You know it is!
32090	Turk	You ladies must be so proud.
32091	Elliot	Todd, what what are you doing?
32092	Todd	I'm getting my gay on. Hey, buddy, you and I should totally have sex some time.
32093	Turk	See, I knew this would come back to me.
32094	Dr. Cox	What the hell is going on?
32095	Turk	Everybody's failing. Mrs. Sikes is indicating peripheral neuropathy, my valve transplant patient's suffering partial complex seizures.
32096	Dr. Cox	How, uh, how're you feeling, there, Davey?
32097	Mr. Bradford	Pretty good. But my feet are a little numb.
32098	Dr. Cox	You hang tight, all right?
32099	Mr. Bradford	OK.
32100	Dr. Cox	I don't get it. I don't get — that makes sense.
32101	Dr. Kelso	Perry, the autopsy just came in on your donor, Jill Tracy. She didn't die of an overdose.
32102	J.D.'s Narration	And just like that, whatever burden of responsibility I felt was lifted. But like I said before, good news for one person can mean bad news for another.
32103	Dr. Cox	She died of rabies? OK, people, all of our transplant patients are infected. We now know what we're dealing with. Let's get involved, we can do this.
32104	Surgeon	Todd, you were impressive in surgery today.
32105	Todd	Thanks, man, you were really impressive in the shower this morning. You know, dong-wise.
32106	Carla	Todd!
32107	Todd	What?
32108	Carla	Stop it!
32109	Elliot	The whole point of coming to grips with your sexuality was to accept yourself and stop being that guy.
32110	Todd	I'm sorry. This whole change is just scaring me. I'm not sure who I am anymore.
32111	Carla	Come here.
32112	Elliot	Oh, get over here, sweetie.
32113	Todd	Oh.
32114	Elliot	It's OK, let it out.
32115	Carla	We're here for you.
32116	Todd	Ohh..
32117	Todd	Brbrbbrbrbrbrbrb...
32118	Carla	WHOA!
32119	Todd	Motorboating. You know, I really gotta thank you gals for outing me. Chicks dig gay dudes.
32120	Todd	Hey, Lisa. I heard you lied and said we didn't do it. Admit it. We doinked.
32121	Lisa	I was sad because my dad died.
32122	Todd	I wasn't.
32123	Carla	So this whole thing was an act?
32124	Elliot	Oh, my God, I cannot believe I let you into that fitting room yesterday while I was trying on bras.
32125	Carla	Ew.
32126	Todd	That was a very special time for me.
32127	Elliot	Ohh.
32128	Carla	Unbelievable.
32129	Elliot	He saw the girls.
32130	Todd	Oh, it's cool if you want to walk away, ladies, 'cuz I love to watch you go.
32131	Todd	Nothing wrong with those.
32132	Todd	Nothing wrong with that either.
32133	Todd	Or that.
32134	Todd	Or that. Phew.
32135	Janitor	What the hell are you?
32136	Todd	I'm the Todd.
32137	J.D.'s Narration	We did everything we could over the next few days to keep the transplant patients going, but odds were against us.
32138	J.D.'s Narration	First we lost Mrs. Sikes...
32139	J.D.'s Narration	...And then Mr. Dennison.
32140	J.D.'s Narration	And I knew that Dr. Cox needed me the exact same way I needed him earlier.
32141	J.D.	Hey. Hungry?
32142	Dr. Cox	No.
32143	J.D.	I guess that lunch was kind of a one-time thing, huh?
32144	J.D.	There's no way you could have seen that coming. I mean, rabies? Come on, there's, like, three reported cases a year. In fact testing for it would have been irresponsible. You would have wasted time those people didn't have.
32145	Dr. Cox	I was obsessed with getting those organs.
32146	J.D.	You had to be. The fact is, those people were going to die in a number of hours and you had to make a call. I would have made the same call.
32147	Dr. Cox	Yeah?
32148	J.D.	Yes. Now I got us lunch. And I think we should eat it.
32149	J.D.	Right then I knew I was going to pull him out of this. But unfortunately, sometimes the hospital picks a day where it's just going to pile it on.
32150	Dr. Cox	Oh, God. Come on.
32151	Dr. Cox	Clear!
32152	Dr. Cox	Still in V-tach, clear!
32153	Dr. Cox	Come on. VF, Clear!
32154	Dr. Cox	Aw, come on. Come on, Come on! GOD! GOD, GOD!
32155	Dr. Cox	He wasn't about to die, was he, Newbie? Could have waited another month for a kidney.
32156	J.D.	Where are you going? Your shift's not over. Hey! Remember what you told me? The second you start blaming yourself for people's deaths...there's no coming back.
32157	Dr. Cox	Yeah...you're right.
32158	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
32159	Open	Hallway. J.D. passes through.
32160	J.D.'s Narration	If you work at a hospital long enough, you learn to expect anything. Whether it's Dr. Kim, who makes patients take their pants off, no matter what...
32161	Dr. Kim	Yep, you've got pink-eye.
32162	Patient	Can I put my pants back on?
32163	Dr. Kim	Right after I put some drops in.
32164	J.D.'s narration	...Or nobody remembering Ray Catay's eightieth birthday.
32165	Mr. Catay	Why aren't you guys making a bigger fuss?
32166	J.D.	Uh, I would have, Mr. Catay, but Dr. Reid is throwing a huge celebration for you later.
32167	J.D.'s Narration	I should tell her about that. The truth is, with modern medicine, 80 isn't that big a deal anymore. It's not like the olden days.
32168	J.D.	Let us not feel sorrow for Bobby Adams. He was 12. He lead a full life. He will be missed, especially by his beautiful wife, Jenny, who stood by him even when he turned 6 and had a midlife crisis and was caught banging one of those naked people who brought us corn.
32169	J.D.	I'd be the oldest man in pilgrim village.
32170	J.D.'s Narration	Still, you should always celebrate life, because you never know when it's going to throw you a curve ball. Like with Dr. Cox. He recently made a decision any doctor would have made and because of it, three patients died. At first, he was inconsolably sad.
32171	J.D.'s Narration	After that, he started acting out.
32172	Jordan	In his defense, he did ask for dressing on the side.
32173	Dr. Cox	Dahpne!
32174	Lisa	I heard that he attacked one of the busboys.
32175	Keith	Yeah, and I heard that he bitch-slapped the maitre-d'.
32176	J.D.	Yeah, enough, gang. That's how rumors get started. Hell, Gloria, I made a joke once that you hooked up with Leonard, the big, black security guard with the hook hand. Now everyone thinks it's true.
32177	Gloria	It is true. And I'm never going back!
32178	Leonard	Gloria! I love me some white meat.
32179	J.D.	OK. Well, make sure to put antiseptic on any puncture wounds, OK? Now, I know Dr. Cox seems crazy mad at the world right now, but let's remember. Three patients died. What's amazing is that he can take a hit like that, one that would knock the rest of us out for good, and come out the other side still standing. That's why the man's an inspiration. I mean, he is a rock.
32180	J.D.'s Narration	Yup, he's the best damn doctor here.
32181	Dr. Cox	Newbie, will you give me a little trouble? I'm having some help here.
32182	J.D.'s Narration	Oh, no.
32183	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
32184	Open	Cafeteria.
32185	Carla	All right, people, listen up. We are a family. And what do families do when one of their own is in trouble?
32186	Elliot	When my brother, Barry, came out of the closet my parents sent him to hetero camp.
32187	Carla	Families that aren't from Connecticut, Elliot.
32188	J.D.'s Narration	Pregnancy had made Carla a little hormonal.
32189	Carla	Now, Dr. Kelso, I've asked you to keep this matter away from the board. Were you able to do that, sir?
32190	Dr. Kelso	Nurse Espinosa, I was...
32191	Carla	WERE YOU?!
32192	Dr. Kelso	YES! I told them Dr. Cox was going to take a leave of absence due to problems at home. Should anyone ask, you beat him.
32193	Jordan	Beat him, got it.
32194	J.D.	I couldn't believe how depressed he was yesterday.
32195	Elliot	Oh, it was so sad.
32196	Janitor	Oh, I know. When I first heard about it was like "whoa, no way!"
32197	J.D.	You don't even know what we're talking about.
32198	Janitor	Sure, I do. The donkey boy up in the ICU.
32199	Carla	We're talking about Dr. Cox.
32200	Janitor	Oh. Well if anyone's interested, there's a donkey boy in the ICU.
32201	Turk	Baby?
32202	Carla	No, Turk. Now, Dr. Cox needs our help getting through this. Jordan can watch him in the morning and at night, but she's also got Jack. Plus, she's not that emotionally available.
32203	Jordan	I'm dead inside.
32204	Carla	Anyway, we're all going to spend time with him. I've made up a schedule. I've got the first shift. Unless there are any questions, this meeting is adjourned.
32205	Elliot	Ooh!
32206	Turk	Gosh!
32207	Elliot	What?
32208	Dr. Kelso	For God's sake, Reid, there's a donkey boy upstairs.
32209	Turk	Damn, that boy is going to town on that carrot.
32210	Dr. Kelso	You fellows want to go to a real donkey show? It's really very tastefully done. I understand one of the women who entertains the donkey used to be on a soap.
32211	Turk & J.D.	Pass.
32212	Dr. Kelso	Well, standing invitation, every Thursday.
32213	J.D.	Always pass, sir.
32214	Dr. Kelso	Well, uh, I'll ask Mickhead.
32215	J.D.	Turk, you know what bothers me? Dr. Cox shows up to work drunk and we're all acting like nothing happened.
32216	Turk	I don't know, I kind of feel for the guy. Besides, I am way too excited. I start my orthopedic rotation today. It is going to be awesome.
32217	J.D.'s Narration	Turk was psyched because orthopedic surgeons are notoriously the most unemotional, jockish surgeons of all.
32218	J.D.'s Narration	He was finally going to have a boss he could connect with.
32219	Dr. Stone	Hey, guys, I'm Dr. Stone. I'm your new attending. All right, fellas, hands in.
32220	Todd	Yeah.
32221	Dr. Stone	Hmm..Mmm..
32222	Turk	Dr. Stone? Usually people put their hands in, someone says "Go get 'em" or "Whoo."
32223	Dr. Stone	No. No words yet. I want you all to get comfortable with the feeling of your brothers' hands on yours. You know, as surgeons, we're constantly opening people up and looking around, but have you ever stopped to open yourself up and look around?
32224	Todd	Whoa.
32225	Turk	Whoo.
32226	Jordan	Hey.
32227	Carla	Hi. How's he doing?
32228	Jordan	He's not talking and he's, you know...
32229	Carla	What?
32230	Jack	Daddy drinks a lot.
32231	Jordan	First complete sentence. Fantastic. Thanks for doing this.
32232	Carla	Hey, sunshine. You gonna at least say hello? Nothing? Listen. I know you keep blaming yourself for this, but you just can't. When my mom died I thought that because I was a nurse I should have been able to prevent it somehow. But over time, I realized that bad things are going to happen. And beating yourself up isn't going to help anyone.
32233	Carla	Oh, that's it, sweetie, come here. Come here.
32234	Todd	Nurse, I need you to help me to drain some fluid. But first we're gonna have to get to work on this patient.
32235	Turk	Todd? Take the scalpel and carve this into your arm: "No nurse will ever touch your dangle."
32236	Dr. Stone	Sh-sh-shhh, Christopher, come on.
32237	Turk	Oh.
32238	Dr. Stone	You know what? I think you're a little edgy because you're here on the sidelines. I know how that digs at you.
32239	Turk	Oh yeah.
32240	Dr. Stone	It digs at you right here. That's OK. What would you say if I said you could have that big knee reconstruction later? What would you say?
32241	Turk	Awesome?
32242	Dr. Stone	Ha! That it is! Yeah.
32243	Turk	Right! OK.
32244	Todd	Finished.
32245	Dr. Stone	People, let's just take a second here to think about what we just did. We fixed an elbow. Yeah. The last thing this man said to me before he went under was how much he enjoyed Sunday morning tennis. Right? And I think I think that's special. And we're special. This was special. Thank you.
32246	Turk	He actually said "I think that's pretty special." Then he got all emotional. How lame is that?
32247	J.D.	That's pretty lame.
32248	Turk	I'm just not into all of that sensitive, touchy-feely stuff.
32249	J.D.	Well, you hug me all the time.
32250	Turk	And even that took awhile. Remember the first time you tried to hug me?
32251	All	Yeah!
32252	J.D.	You're sports team's in the World Series!
32253	Turk	Ha! What a game!
32254	J.D.	A grand slam!
32255	Turk	With Dr. Stone it's different. We're not friends. What kind of guy gets all cuddly with a guy he just met? It's pathetic.
32256	Todd	Dude, that's a little harsh.
32257	Turk	Todd, how long have you been holding that button?
32258	Dr. Stone	Long enough for me to hear what you really think.
32259	Turk	Great. Is there another guy on this planet who's that sensitive?
32260	J.D.	OK, let it out. I got you. J.D.'s got you. Hold me tighter. Little too tight. There's a good spot.
32261	Keith	Elliot, why did I have to come?
32262	Elliot	Because we're a couple, Keith, we do things together.
32263	Keith	OK, uh, would it be OK if I moved? Uh, this couch is uncomfortable.
32264	Elliot	Mm. Go.
32265	Elliot	Dr. Cox, I am not going to pretend to know what you're going through but believe me, I've had my experiences. Remember last year, when I put my malaria patient through that painful procedure even when everyone knew he was going to die anyway?
32266	Keith	You know what? I'm just gonna go sit in the bathroom.
32267	Elliot	Anyway, you know what I do when I'm having a really tough time getting through things?
32268	Elliot's Voiceover	I just leave the city, get into nature and just take stock of what's important. Just make sure you don't go to a popular parachute drop zone.
32269	Elliot	I don't know if it was the adrenaline rush or because I thought he was an angel but that's the fastest I've ever gone from meeting to kissing. Yep. True story.
32270	Patient	I'm just worried about this mole.
32271	Dr. Kim	It doesn't look cancerous. Eh, get in there and take your pants off.
32272	J.D.	You gonna go talk to Dr. Stone?
32273	Turk	Nah, it'll blow over. Plus, he's a surgeon, and surgeons don't hold grudges. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go scrub up. And by the way, your shift with Dr. Cox starts in ten minutes.
32274	J.D.'s Narration	Turk was right. Personal feelings shouldn't get in the way of a professional relationship. But they do.
32275	Turk	What do you say we rebuild that knee?
32276	Dr. Stone	Actually, Dr. Turk, I think I'm going to let Dr. Norman here take the lead on this one, OK?
32277	J.D.	Look, Carla, I have a real problem with what Dr. Cox did and I don't think I can go over there.
32278	Carla	I'm going to send somebody else over for you, OK? J.D. was supposed to come, but he, um...he he's not coming.
32279	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
32280	Open	ICU. J.D. and a couple stand outside a child's room.
32281	J.D.'s Narration	I couldn't really worry about bailing on Dr. Cox. The Stanleys' child was sick and I just spent the last twenty minutes asking them awkward questions to rule out the possibility of child abuse.
32282	Mrs. Stanley	Who would smother their own child?
32283	J.D.	You'd be surprised. There's something called Munchausen Syndrome, where a parent will intentionally harm their child to get some attention on themselves.
32284	Mrs. Stanley	I've never heard of that. Someone should do a public service announcement about it.
32285	J.D.'s Thoughts	Hmm, someone should.
32286	J.D.	You had a tough day at the office, so you come home, make yourself some dinner, smother your kids, pop in a movie, maybe have a drink. It's fun right? Wrong. Don't smother your kids.
32287	J.D.	That problem would be gone forever.
32288	Carla	I am so mad at you!
32289	Elliot	Yeah, you big jerk!
32290	Carla	How could you stand up Dr. Cox?
32291	Elliot	Wait, is that what we came to yell at him for?
32292	Carla	Well, yeah. What did you think it was?
32293	Elliot	Oh, apparently J.D. told Mr. Catay in there that I'm throwing him some big birthday party. Yeah, so when he asked where the cake was, I totally panicked and I told him we all pitched in and got him a weekend in Vegas.
32294	Carla	What?
32295	Mr. Catay	Can I see Celine Dion?
32296	Elliot	Oh, anything you want, Mr. Catay! You're going halfsies with me on everything.
32297	Carla	I can't believe you didn't show up at Dr. Cox's. Do you have any idea who I had to send in your place?
32298	The Worthless Peons	Gray skies are gonna clear up,
32299	Ted	Put on a happy face,
32300	The Worthless Peons	A happy face, reach up and part the clouds and cheer up...
32301	Todd	Hey if you're not digging this, I've got a hundred jokes about these.
32302	The Worthless Peons	...sunshine all over the place, just put on a happy face! Yeah!
32303	J.D.	I'm just not down with the whole drinking and doctoring thing, OK? Excuse me.
32304	Turk	I'm never gonna get a good surgery on this rotation.
32305	J.D.	I can help you with Dr. Stone. He's one of my people. He's a sensy.
32306	Turk	What's a sensy?
32307	J.D.	It's short for sensitive guy. Our music is acoustic alternative. We marvel at fireflies. And when we help a drunk girl home from the bar, sure we cop a feel. A feel of her hair as we're pulling it back so she doesn't get any vomit in it.
32308	Turk	I'm having a weird med-school flashback. I think you held my hair back while I vomited.
32309	J.D.	I did! That was our last year! I didn't what you to get Jagermeister in your corn rows.
32310	Turk	My Latrell Sprewell phase.
32311	J.D.	Hockey?
32312	Turk	Basketball.
32313	J.D.	Dammit.
32314	Turk	What am I gonna do about Dr. Stone.
32315	J.D.	You're gonna cry in front of him.
32316	J.D.	Laugh if you must, but it'll show him you have emotional depth and it will trigger a nurturing impulse inside him that we sensies can't resist.
32317	Turk	How the hell am I supposed to cry?
32318	Janitor	You need to cry, let's brainstorm. I could hit you over the head with a wrench. Or, I could stab you in the gut with a knife.
32319	Janitor	Knife-wrench! Practical and safe.
32320	Janitor	Waah! OH! Ohh! Oh boy. Ahh!
32321	J.D.	Anywho, don't worry about crying. I got this menthol from the pharmacy. I read online that actors in Hollyweird actors spray it in their eyes when they need to fake cry.
32322	Turk	Why do you have five of them?
32323	J.D.	Oh, I'm using it for the final death scene in my movie, Dr. Acula. Last night, my German financier, Hans, rest in peace, died on the Autobahn. So now I gotta shoot the whole thing on my cell phone.
32324	Jordan	Hello, Bob. No cheek kiss necessary.
32325	Dr. Kelso	Oh, good. I have pike-breath. So, uh, when was the last time I was here, '97? I know it's been awhile because Enid could still fit through that door. I shouldn't joke, she's very ill.
32326	Jordan	I'm gonna go take a shower.
32327	Dr. Kelso	Hello, Perry. I don't really know why I'm here, but Nurse Espinosa said if I didn't swing by, she would stop coming over to my house and giving instructions to my pool boy. He speaks perfect English, but he doesn't have an front teeth, so I can never look at him without laughing. Heh, heh, heh. Anyway, I don't know what she expects me to say to you. I mean, all you do is bust my ass day in and day out. I guess you you keep me in line on those rare occasions when I lose sight of things. You could say we balance each other out pretty well. Whew. Perry, the hospital needs you. I need you. What the hell are you doing?
32328	Keith	Did Elliot leave without telling me?
32329	Jordan	Why is there an intern in my bathroom? It's not my birthday.
32330	Keith	She made me watch.
32331	J.D.	OK, there he is. You ready?
32332	J.D.	OW! He's the one who needs to cry, you idiot, not me!
32333	J.D.	AAAHHH!!
32334	Janitor	Oh, yeah, I forgot all about that crying stuff. I was just...Oh, hey, loose thread.
32335	J.D.	No!
32336	Janitor	Got it. Knife-wrench! For kids.
32337	J.D.	OK, he's hugging Colonel Doctor, which means you got about seven seconds.
32338	Turk	A hug takes seven seconds?
32339	J.D.	A good one does. Here's the plan. What you're gonna do is tell him a story that isn't inherently sad. That way, when you get all emotional, he's gonna think you're extra sensitive. At which point, I'm gonna nail you with the menthol and you'll be crying like a ten year old pilgrim widow. Here he comes. And, blacktion.
32340	Turk	Dr. Stone.
32341	Dr. Stone	Christopher.
32342	Turk	Yeah, you know, I'm just out here thinking about my wife. She's pregnant with our first child.
32343	J.D.'s Thoughts	And, come on, fishy, take the bait.
32344	Dr. Stone	Children are pretty darn special. I have seven of my own and each one is just as compassionate as the next one. That is the quality that me and my six ex-wives try to instill in our children.
32345	Turk	It's overwhelming here.
32346	Dr. Stone	Exactly. You know, my new wife, Carol, she's four months pregnant.
32347	Turk	Congratulations.
32348	Dr. Stone	We're separated.
32349	Turk	Mmhmm.
32350	Dr. Stone	We are not so different, you and I.
32351	J.D.'s Thoughts	He's not a sensy. He's a nutjob.
32352	Dr. Stone	It's hug time, Chris. Come here.
32353	Dr. Stone	Whoa, whoa!
32354	Turk	Old habit.
32355	Turk	So, he has a mild concussion, and they're going to let him rest for awhile.
32356	J.D.	Good. That gives us time to come up with a new plan.
32357	Turk	Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. That's it. I'm done. There's no way he and I are going to have a relationship. Not unless I want to bear his seventeenth child.
32358	J.D.	He's your attending, you have to connect with him. You need somebody you can look up to. Someone you can count on. What you need is someone who will always have your back.
32359	Turk	No, J.D., that's what you need. That's what you've always needed. Maybe after five years of working here, that's not such a good thing anymore. I gotta go and do my shift with Dr. Cox.
32360	J.D.'s Narration	Right then I knew what I had to do.
32361	J.D.	Hey.
32362	Turk	What's up.
32363	J.D.	You're probably wondering why I didn't show up before, huh? I know you wanted me to, even though you'd never admit it. Normally I would kill to get into this apartment. And you try and keep me out. I say try, because at your Superbowl party, which I was not invited to, I was lucky enough to be able to watch the second half from right over there. I was the bearded Domino's employee you invited in because I said I was a fan of Jerome Bettis, who ever the hell that is. Anyway, I tried to convince myself the reason I didn't come earlier was because of you coming into work drunk. But that's not it. I was scared. I guess after all this time, I still think of you as like this superhero that will help me out of any situation I'm in. I needed that. But, that's my problem, you know? And I'll deal with that. I guess I came over here to tell you how proud of you I am. Not because you did the best you could for those patients. But because after 20 years of being a doctor, when things go badly, you still take it this hard. And I gotta tell you, man, I mean, that's the kind of doctor I want to be.
32364	J.D.'s Narration	Maybe he just needed time to heal, or maybe he just needed to see how much everybody cared but I like to think that it was because of me that he was finally able to say this.
32365	Dr. Cox	You don't drink scotch.
32366	J.D.	Ohhh, that's awful.
32367	Carla	Glad you finally shaved.
32368	J.D.'s Narration	That's the thing about family. When you fall off the deep end, you can always count on them to rally around you. When you come back, you might get a quick hug, a pat on the shoulder...
32369	J.D.'s Narration	...Maybe just a nod.
32370	J.D.'s Narration	But no words really need to be spoken. Of course, it's always nice when they are.
32371	Dr. Cox	J.D....Thank you.
32372	J.D.	Welcome.
32373	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
32374	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
32375	Open	ICU. Dr. Cox and the interns stand around a bed.
32376	Dr. Cox	Look, one of the reasons interns have so much trouble putting in chest tubes is because it is a violent procedure. You must not be scared, though, children. You must use force to get the tube between the ribs and pop it through the pleura. What do you say there, Lis? You can do this.
32377	Keith	Uh, Dr. Cox, I'm not so sure I'm comfortable with this.
32378	Dr. Cox	Then you shouldn't have lost my teaching mannequin.
32379	Keith	I don't know what happened to it.
32380	Janitor	Hello, carpool lane! Ha ha ha! So what movie do you want to see?
32381	Lisa	Inserting chest tube. MM!
32382	Keith	GAAH! Lisa! God, he was joking!
32383	Dr. Cox	Yes, I was Lisa, now take the rest of the afternoon off and think about what you did here today.
32384	Dr. Cox	This is a warning, people. Anyone else who hurts Keith is going to get the exact same treatment as Lisa. Good day.
32385	Elliot	Nothing like having to watch your boyfriend get humiliated on a daily basis.
32386	Gloria	Purple Nurple!
32387	Carla	Baby, look at this. I'm starting to look like a big fat pregnant lady.
32388	Turk	No you're not, baby, you look like you just let yourself go a little.
32389	Turk	OK, that came out wrong, but baby, it's OK. You're just overreacting because your pregnancy hormones are totally taking over. It's fine. These past few days, your moods have changed like that!
32390	Carla	That is not true!
32391	Turk	It's cool.
32392	Carla	I'm sorry. Let me kiss the owie? Kiss the owie?
32393	Carla	Mmm. Oh, baby, I wanna do it right now.
32394	Turk	You don't want to do it right now, it will pass.
32395	Carla	This is happening.
32396	Turk	Damn right this is happening.
32397	Carla	My mom. I can't believe she'll never meet her grandchild.
32398	Turk	Do you want to start with kissing or should we just get right into the good stuff?
32399	Carla	What is wrong with you?!
32400	Turk	Oof! When will you learn?
32401	J.D.'s Thoughts	Hmm, Turk talking to a new staff member. Give her a treat and say hello.
32402	J.D.	Hello!
32403	Turk	J.D., I'm sure you know Kim Briggs.
32404	J.D.	Uh, no, you big knucklehead, I don't. On behalf of everyone here at Sacred Heart, I'd like to say konnichiwa.
32405	Kim	I've been here five years, big guy.
32406	J.D.	I know that, Kim. It's a game we play. What's your name? It's Turk. What's that guy's name? I don't know, he's a patient. Looks like a Dave. Are you a Dave? Maybe he's a Dave, we don't know. Hey!
32407	Kim	Torture him about this.
32408	Turk	Will do. Peace out!
32409	J.D.	How come I've never noticed her before?
32410	Turk	Oh, because she wears a wedding ring. Yeah, you don't notice women who wear wedding rings.
32411	Turk's Voiceover	Kim was here on your first day.
32412	Turk's Voiceover	She was at Ben's funeral.
32413	Turk's Voiceover	She's been around.
32414	J.D.	] Everybody was Kung-fu fighting! Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah!
32415	J.D.	So you're saying because she wears a wedding ring she's invisible to me?
32416	Turk	Yes.
32417	J.D.	Please, T, I'm not that shallow.
32418	Turk	Oh, really? Will all the women in the room who are married, please remove your wedding rings?
32419	J.D.	Dr. Feinburg? Anastasia? Gift Shop Girl?
32420	Gift Shop Girl	Hey, J.D.
32421	J.D.	I thought you died.
32422	Gift Shop Girl	Nope. I just got married.
32423	J.D.	But I sent your family flowers.
32424	Gift Shop Girl	I know. You bought them from me. It was kind of weird.
32425	J.D.	Gift Shop Girl!
32426	Gift Shop Girl	What?
32427	Gift Shop Girl	Stop that!
32428	J.D.	Sorry.
32429	Kim	That's backwards. It's been bugging me for years.
32430	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
32431	Open	Patient's room. J.D. and Kim enter.
32432	Kim	How are we doing, Mr. Peters?
32433	J.D's Narration	I had checked up on Kim. She got along with everybody.
32434	J.D.'s Narration	All the guys liked her.
32435	Kim	Toughen up, sailors, chick on deck. I need a few more towels in the ladies' locker room.
32436	Todd	Oh, I got a towel for ya.
32437	Todd	YAH!
32438	Kim	Thanks, Todd.
32439	J.D.'s Narration	All the women liked her.
32440	Kim	I just love that every woman knows how to do that.
32441	J.D.'s Narration	She even got along with the greasers.
32442	Kim	Guys, I know everyone gives you a hard time, but trust me. This look is coming back.
32443	J.D.'s Thoughts	I never got a synchronized snap from the greasers.
32444	Kim	Mr. Peters, I know that having a gal urologist might seem a little uncomfortable, but the penis is just another excretory organ, so let's go ahead and take the stigma off it. Now this is the length of the average penis.
32445	J.D.'s Thoughts	WHAT?!
32446	Mr. Peters	That seems about right.
32447	Kim	Good for you! I was just messing with Dr. Dorian over there.
32448	J.D.	You know what? I'm not talking to any of you guys.
32449	J.D.	You lie
32450	J.D.	Oh, my God.
32451	Elliot	Keith, I know we had plans tonight, but I am way too tired.
32452	Keith	No problem. I'll call you tomorrow.
32453	Jordan	Hey, girls. Listen, Perry got uppity with me for, and I quote, spending twenty thousand dollars we don't have on shoes. So I figured I'd get back him by treating everyone to drinks tonight.
32454	Elliot	I'll go.
32455	Carla	Elliot, you just told Keith you were too tired. What are you doing?
32456	Elliot	I, uh, I think Keith and I might be done.
32457	Carla	What?!
32458	Janitor	Hey, Dorian, let me borrow that pencil for a second. Just one second? Thank you.
32459	Janitor	Oh no. I snap-a da pencil. What do you think? It's for my stand-up act.
32460	J.D.	Where do you perform?
32461	Janitor	I'm at the Giggle Pit. Every Monday at sunup.
32462	J.D.	Well, I'll have to come by sometime.
32463	Janitor	Do it, man.
32464	J.D.	No, wait a second, I'm mad at you! You stole my video camera with all the scenes on it from Dr. Acula, the vampire movie I'm making.
32465	Janitor	Why do you think I stole it?
32466	J.D.	I don't know, maybe I was surfing the hospital's website and I saw that someone posted the "Dr. Acula delivers a baby, then eats it" scene? Someone with the screen name "Rotinaj?" Rotinaj is just Janitor spelled backwards, Rotinaj.
32467	Janitor	Morning, Dr. Rotinaj.
32468	Dr. Rotinaj	Good morning, Mr. Clean-up man!
32469	Kim	Mr. Peters, I looked at your CT scan and I'm recommending that we don't do surgery.
32470	Mr. Peters	Great.
32471	Kim	This is goodbye for us, but I'm leaving you in the very capable hands of Dr. John D. Dorian. You take care.
32472	Kim	I gave you a new middle initial. It reassures me for some reason. In my mind, the D stands for Dallas because I just got finished telling Mr. Peters that's where I lost my virginity. Don't know how we got down that path, it's something about that old man that just makes me want to open up.
32473	J.D.	Hm.
32474	Kim	Anyway, I hope you don't mind your new middle initial.
32475	J.D.	I don't mind it a turtle's wink.
32476	J.D.'s Thoughts	Wait, you only pepper your conversations with cute animal imagery if you're smitten.
32477	Kim	Could you lend me your pen?
32478	J.D.	Quick as a porcupine's hiccup.
32479	J.D.'s Thoughts	All right, there's only one problem with this.
32480	Kim	OK. See you J.D.
32481	J.D.	Kim, wait. Unfortunately there's no way I can make you mine. Unless I make you mine...for eternity!
32482	Kim	Dr. Acula, don't....stop!
32483	J.D.	Vampires like it windy.
32484	Carla	Why are you breaking up with Keith?
32485	Elliot	Look, Keith is sweet. But after watching him get walked on again this morning, I feel like I need a stronger man in m life. I mean, I want what you guys have. Someone who will stand up for me when I really need it, you know? Someone as confident as Turk, or as brave as Dr. Cox, or as...I'm sorry, Laverne, I don't really know your husband. What are some of Mr. Roberts' good qualities?
32486	Laverne	Well, he was a roadie for Jimi Hendrix and when it rains, he carries me to the car.
32487	Elliot	And you guys have been together for what, 60 years?
32488	Laverne	I'm 48. And I'm done here.
32489	Elliot	Mm. My bad.
32490	Carla	I don't want Keith to go. Elliot, I don't want Keith to go.
32491	Jordan	Aww, there, there.
32492	Jordan	What? I'm pregnant, I'm crying, I'm laughing. Enough already. It's boring.
32493	Dr. Kelso	Listen up, nametags. I need to wire some cash to my son so he can make bail. Apparently that musical he was making was just a front for a crystal meth lab. And here's the kicker. He fled to Toronto, so now the frickin' Mounties are involved. Anywho, I need someone to zip out to my house and grab $400.
32494	Janitor	I'll do it. I shouldn't be mopping in here anyway. This is a rug.
32495	J.D.	Don't let him in your house, sir. He'll steal everything you got, like he stole my video camera.
32496	Dr. Kelso	Do you know the difference between me and you, Dorian?
32497	J.D.	Your melon-size prostate, sir?
32498	Dr. Kelso	I will never fear this man. Do you think I'm afraid of you, chief?
32499	Janitor	No, sir, I do not.
32500	Dr. Kelso	Now look. I keep my extra cash in a pickle jar on the top shelf over the sink.
32501	Dr. Kelso	Enid wants that jar so bad she can taste it. Oh, that's right. You don't remember that she's paralyzed and can't stand up out of her wheelchair. That's why you're not laughing.
32502	Dr. Cox	No, Bob. We're not laughing because we're all horrified.
32503	Dr. Kelso	Well, it tickles me.
32504	Dr. Cox	Eh.
32505	Turk	OK, honey, I know Elliot upset you with this whole Keith thing. But we're all gonna be extra extra sensitive so you don't get riled up, OK?
32506	Elliot	I'm wearing red. Should I not be wearing red around her?
32507	Turk	She's pregnant. She's not a bull.
32508	Elliot	I know you think I'm just being crazy, but Elliot, you should not give up on Keith. You say he's not strong enough for you because he keeps getting stepped on at work? That's what it's like for interns. You're just doing what we all do when we start to get serious in a relationship. You're freaking out and you're trying to poke holes in it. Remember when I first started dating Turk and I wanted to bail on him because he cried at the end of sex?
32509	Turk	Baby!
32510	J.D.	Relax, brown bear, there's no shame in cry-maxing.
32511	Carla	And you know how hard single life can be. Just ask Kim.
32512	J.D.	Wait, Kim's single?
32513	Elliot	Oh, yeah. She's been divorced for like, over a year. She just wears her ring at the hospital so she doesn't get hit on all the time.
32514	J.D.	Turk! Keys!
32515	J.D.	Yahtzee!
32516	J.D.	Hey, girl. What are you doing? Wanna get some coffee later?
32517	J.D.'s Narration	And then, the ultimate Cox block.
32518	Dr. Cox	Hey! Why isn't Mr. Peters in there getting surgery?
32519	Kim	I decided against it.
32520	J.D.	Yeah, she thought it would be best if I treated him medically.
32521	Dr. Cox	First of all, Newbie, nobody's ever thought that. Ever. Secondly, she's a cutter. When was the last time you met a cutter who didn't want to cut? Laverne? You've been here 40 years now. You ever heard of such a thing?
32522	Laverne	I'ma kill somebody.
32523	J.D.'s Narration	I guess we all get mad when people say things we don't want to hear.
32524	Carla	Elliot! I'm sorry, but I can't let you leave until you promise me you'll think about it with Keith.
32525	Elliot	Oh, my God, Carla. Will you please just butt out of this one?
32526	J.D.'s Narration	Especially when things feel a bit fishy.
32527	Janitor	Here's you cash.
32528	Dr. Kelso	Oh, thanks. Say, that's a new coat.
32529	Janitor	Yep, just picked it up.
32530	Dr. Kelso	Where'd you get the money to buy it?
32531	Janitor	Mmm, I don't think it's any business of yours.
32532	J.D.'s Narration	Still, it's always good to hear the truth.
32533	Dr. Cox	Surgery is really the only thing that has a shot at curing this guy and the reason that she's not going to do it is because he's older and he's got heart issues which makes him high-risk and if he were to drop dead on her operating table, well, that would make her surgery stats go down. And that wouldn't look very good on a young doctor's resume, would it?
32534	J.D.'s Narration	Even if it meant losing respect for someone you thought you might like.
32535	Kim	What can I say? You got me.
32536	J.D.'s Thoughts	Damn.
32537	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
32538	Open	Parking lot. The greasers roll up to Turk and J.D. in an old convertible.
32539	Greaser	Dr. Turk! I covered your gastric bypass patient last night and he left a message for you.
32540	Turk	What did he say?
32541	Greaser	You are square!
32542	Turk	Stupid greasers.
32543	J.D.	Oh, here comes Kim. She's had all night to think about what she did, so she'll probably be in a shame spiral. Let's enjoy it.
32544	Kim	Hey, fellas, how you livin'?
32545	Turk	Large! What!
32546	Turk	What, was I not supposed to answer?
32547	J.D.'s Narration	I wasn't the only one having relationship problems.
32548	Elliot	Sorry about the way I left last night. We're OK, right?
32549	Carla	Until you receive further notice, consider us not speaking.
32550	Dr. Kelso	I know you took my money to buy that ridiculous coat.
32551	Janitor	I bet you can't...prove it.
32552	Dr. Kelso	Enid, you are my eyewitness. Did he take more than $400? Is that a new pantsuit?
32553	Dr. Kelso	You think you're pretty smart, don't you?
32554	Janitor	All I think is that leather never goes out of style. And if you're gonna keep your money in a pickle jar, you should probably know how much is in there. And that it never hurts to buy your invalid wife something nice, so maybe she can feel pretty. And these are general thoughts about life. Nothing specific to you.
32555	J.D.	Mmm, that was nice.
32556	Turk	That wasn't me.
32557	Kim	Hey, dudes.
32558	J.D.	Don't "Hey, dudes" us, you know what bothers me?
32559	Kim	Non-threatening, colloquial greetings?
32560	J.D.	It bothers me that a doctor wouldn't help a patient so she could keep her stats up.
32561	Turk	Yeah.
32562	Kim	Look, J.D., surgery is competitive. We do what we have to to get ahead.
32563	J.D.	Well, my best friend here is a surgeon and he would never pass on a risky surgery just to keep his stats up.
32564	Turk	Actually, I have done that. Everyone has.
32565	J.D.	Oh, my God. Out of here!
32566	J.D.	Dr. Cox, please weigh in.
32567	Dr. Cox	Well, it's no secret how I feel about surgeons. I hate them. I would liken them to rocks, but that would be an insult to rocks, because you see, at least rocks are useful to society. We build bridges with them. We throw them at guys who wear those tiny phones clipped to their heads. It's a phone. You can't do this? However...
32568	J.D.	Now back to the crux of the matter! Hit her, Per!
32569	Dr. Cox	However, it is not Dr. Briggs' fault that she works in a broken system. Top hospitals are only interested in hiring surgeons who they think are flawless. Newbie, that's not the answer you thought you were gonna hear. But as always, I don't care.
32570	Kim	Thank God he didn't see this.
32571	Kim	Yeah, Mom, I was listening the whole time, I just couldn't talk.
32572	J.D.	RRRGH!
32573	Dr. Kelso	Looks like someone took their new titanium 8-iron with a leather grip and went to town on your van.
32574	Janitor	Well done, sir.
32575	Dr. Kelso	What, you think I did it?
32576	Dr. Kelso	Too bad you can't prove it.
32577	Janitor	Really?
32578	J.D.	I think I need to take more...bloooood!
32579	Dr. Kelso	What the hell is this?
32580	Janitor	It's Dorian's camera. This must be a scene from Dr. Acula.
32581	Turk	You ain't takin' no more blood from my ho-slappin' hand. I will pimp slap you. This feels a little racist, J.D. Why can't I be a vampire?
32582	J.D.	Because it's my movie! Now let's take it from the top and I'm not gonna ask you again. Blacker.
32583	Turk	Blacker.
32584	J.D.	Yes, please.
32585	Turk	Blacker.
32586	Janitor	Now comes the good part.
32587	Dr. Kelso	Prove that! And that! And that! And that! AND THAT! Yeah!
32588	Dr. Kelso	What do you want?
32589	Elliot	So hey, I thought you might be hungry. Did you enjoy the pancakes I left on your computer?
32590	Carla	No. But I enjoyed the 3000 ants crawling on my keyboard.
32591	Todd	There's two of them doing it on the "F" button. I could be wrong, but it looks like two girls.
32592	Carla	What do you want, Elliot?
32593	Elliot	I wanted to apologize.
32594	Carla	Well, save it.
32595	Elliot	Look, Carla, I...
32596	Carla	Honestly, you must be really bored with the friendship because all you do is take, take, take. And the most embarrassing thing is you don't even realize you're doing it. Because let's face it. At the end of the day, you're nothing but a spoiled, selfish, neurotic little girl from Connecticut who has absolutely no idea how to...
32597	Keith	Whoa, whoa, OK, that's enough! I don't know what you two are fighting about, but it doesn't matter. Because no one is allowed to be that mean to my girlfriend, especially when all she's trying to do is apologize! Are we clear?
32598	J.D.'s Narration	Nobody really speaks to Carla like that.
32599	Turk	It was really cool getting to know you, man.
32600	J.D.'s Narration	The irony was that Keith was yelling at the one woman who was trying to save his relationship.
32601	Carla	I'm sorry, Elliot.
32602	J.D.'s Narration	And even more ironic was that it looked like she had.
32603	Elliot	Thanks for standing up for me.
32604	Keith	Yeah, totally.
32605	J.D.'s Narration	I think Elliot finally seeing who Keith really was made me understand why I was so upset with Kim.
32606	Kim	Look who's happy again.
32607	J.D.	Yeah, well, it's just...
32608	Kim	J.D., one second, uh, I'm on the phone with my Mom.
32609	Kim	She just got her RV fixed. Mom, I gotta go. You can call me from the road.
32610	Kim	My mom loves the road.
32611	J.D.	I finally figured out what bothers me so much about you.
32612	Kim	Well, lay it on me, studly.
32613	J.D.	It's the way you're so concerned about protecting yourself. I mean, no one in this entire hospital has a bad thing to say about you, and I'm guessing that's because you're so careful not to rub anyone the wrong way. And you still wear your wedding ring. That prevents any guy from getting anywhere near you. You wouldn't operate on Mr. Peters, and we both know you're protecting yourself there. I don't know, I guess in the grand scheme of things, it's not that big a deal. I just I was a little disappointed to find out how you turned out to be. I'll see you around, Kim.
32614	Kim	See you...
32615	Dr. Kelso	I don't want to do this.
32616	Janitor	No problem. I'll just give the videotape to the police.
32617	Dr. Kelso	Ladies and gentlemen, this is your chief of medicine, Bob Kelso. I feel compelled to tell you that I do, in fact, fear the Janitor.
32618	Dr. Kelso	Honestly, is there anyone else with such a brilliant mind?
32619	Elliot	You planned all this, didn't you? The whole being mean thing so that Keith would stand up for me. Oh, thanks.
32620	Turk	You didn't plan a damn thing, did you?
32621	Carla	No, I snapped like a twig.
32622	Turk	Yeah.
32623	Carla	Please don't tell her.
32624	J.D.	Who is Dr. Briggs operating on?
32625	Lisa	Your patient, Mr. Peters.
32626	Dr. Kelso	So, please join me...
32627	Dr. Kelso	in basking in the glow of the Janitor's awesome...this isn't a word.
32628	Janitor	Read it.
32629	Dr. Kelso	Fearitude. Good night.
32630	Janitor	And good luck. I love that movie.
32631	J.D.	I saw you did that surgery on Mr. Peters. Did you decide it was the right thing to do?
32632	Kim	No, actually it was a stupid career risk.
32633	J.D.	Then why did you do it?
32634	Kim	Because for some reason, I find myself really caring about what you think of me.
32635	J.D.	Oh. Cool.
32636	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
32637	Open	Admissions Area. J.D. enters.
32638	J.D.'s Narration	It's springtime at Sacred Heart and the whole hospital had that end of the year smell.
32639	J.D.	Gloria, I need you to change the dressing on Mr. Currans' wound.
32640	Gloria	And I need you to suck it.
32641	J.D.	Wow, Gloria, do you kiss your great, great, great, great, great grandkids with that mouth? Zoom, zoom, zoom! Ted, that's funny! Where's the chuckle?
32642	Ted	Bank foreclosed on my house.
32643	J.D.	Where's your mom?
32644	Ted	She's out in the car with the cats.
32645	J.D.'s Narration	Dr. Kelso celebrated spring by wearing his golf shorts to flaunt his oddly youthful legs.
32646	Dr. Kelso	Take 'em in, people. I shaved 'em for you.
32647	Jordan	Tell your daddy what you just did.
32648	Jack	I made poopy in the potty.
32649	Dr. Cox	You know, son, as a doctor I spend a lot of my day dealing with other people's poop and I'm not gonna lie to you, Jacky, it gets old. Now that's — that's not to say that I haven't enjoyed the last three years of waking up to a fresh brown trout in your Huggies. Besides, you're going to be doing the same thing for me someday real soon. And yet, aside from actually seeing you being born and that time Wayne Gretzky said "what's up" to me in line at the bank, you being out of diapers is the best damn thing that's ever happened to me. It truly is. Now why don't you go in your room and — and play for a little while, because your mom and I are gonna celebrate up here, grown-up style.
32650	Jordan	All right, let's get this over with. I need to take a nap. I've been exhausted all week.
32651	Dr. Cox	Yippee.
32652	Jordan	Uh-uh, no kissing! Hands behind your back! Let's go!
32653	J.D.'s Narration	Yup, love was definitely in the air.
32654	J.D.	Hey, Kim, how would you like a night on the town with the hottest doctor in this place?
32655	Kim	I'd rather just go out with you. Ohh! Zoom, zoom, zoom!
32656	J.D.	You zoom, zoom, zoom?
32657	Kim	Ha! Of course. I invented the zoom, zoom, zoom.
32658	J.D.	Oh, cool.
32659	J.D.'s Thoughts	Liar.
32660	Kim	So, Josh, you are suffering from a condition called phimosis. It's basically a hardening of your foreskin. As part of your treatment, I'm going to ask that you masturbate five times a week.
32661	J.D.'s Thoughts	Help the poor kid out.
32662	J.D.	Well, five times a week, huh? For me that would be cutting back.
32663	J.D.'s Thoughts	He said, in front of his future girlfriend.
32664	J.D.	You know what? I should probably mosey.
32665	J.D.	Looking forward to our date.
32666	Kim	See you around six, wear something slutty. Zoom, zoom, zoom.
32667	J.D.	That's mine.
32668	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
32669	Open	Admissions Area. Carla sits on the counter, now quite visibly pregnant.
32670	Carla	Eh? You like that?
32671	Todd	Wow. I felt it move.
32672	Carla	Todd, you're touching your crotch.
32673	Todd	I know, and I'm loving it.
32674	J.D.	Hey, Tubby.
32675	Carla	Oh, J.D., come here, I want to you to feel something, quick!
32676	J.D.	Ooh.
32677	J.D.	OWWWW!!
32678	Carla	Don't call me Tubby.
32679	J.D.'s Thoughts	Pregnant witch. Hey, there's Kim. She and Elliot had bonded over their ability to communicate at the speed of light.
32680	J.D.'s Thoughts	You'd have to slow it down for humans to understand.
32681	Elliot	So the shower's gonna start at four, and there's gonna be baby games.
32682	Kim	You're such a good friend. You know, I got her a present, but since we're not close, I think I'm just gonna go home and get ready for my date.
32683	Elliot	Oh.
32684	Kim	Oh, hey, you! I'm psyched for tonight.
32685	Elliot	Ah, yes. The best thing about having a date with J.D. is that if you're having Chinese food and you decide you want Mexican, you can just walk right on to the other side of the food court.
32686	J.D.	We are not going the mall, Elliot. I was gonna make you dinner and then go to karaoke, but I'm not sure how to do both in the same night. Unless, of course...
32687	Elliot	J.D., not Floating Head Doctor.
32688	J.D.	Too late, I'm already there.
32689	J.D.'s Thoughts	Body could stay home and prepare the feast.
32690	J.D.'s Thoughts	And as always, Head could take care of entertainment.
32691	Kim	Don't go breaking my heart.
32692	J.D.'s Head	I couldn't if I tried.
32693	Kim & J.D.'s Head	Oh, honey, if I get restless...
32694	Kim	Stop hogging the mic!
32695	J.D.'s Head	Body, come!
32696	J.D.'s Head	Stupid Body! I gotta do everything myself!
32697	J.D.'s Head	Oooh, oooh, and nobody knows...Come with me, Come with me...
32698	J.D.	Head loves karaoke.
32699	Kim	Well, I'm up for anything. I married my high school boyfriend, so the only first date I ever went on was in tenth grade. I began with me sitting in the backseat of his Miata, because his friend, Benny, called shotgun. And it ends with us going to the arcade, and I quote, to eat pizza and beat up nerds. And I married that guy!
32700	J.D.	Well, trust me, Kim. I've beaten up many nerds in my day. But tonight's about you having the best first date ever.
32701	Kim	All right, slugger!
32702	J.D. & Elliot	Bye!
32703	Elliot	You don't have anything planned, do you?
32704	J.D.	You had to soil the whole food court thing. It's veal piccata night at Sbarro's!
32705	Elliot	Well, I'd help you out, but I'm planning a baby shower for Carla. I am going to make this cafeteria look totally different.
32706	Elliot	Ted, what the hell?
32707	Ted	It's the only song we know with "baby" in it.
32708	Elliot	I want my money back.
32709	Crispin	What money?!
32710	Ted	What? I lost my house. Give me a break.
32711	Elliot	Fun, right? No one is mingling! And why are all the morgue guys so cliquey?
32712	Doug	I want yellow.
32713	Keith	I wish I had cool morgue friends. Hey guys!
32714	Carla	Oooooooh! Laverne, I didn't know you knit!
32715	Laverne	I sure do. Mr. Roberts doesn't have one pair of store-bought socks. I am going to knit you a muzzle.
32716	Dr. Cox	Those are all from us.
32717	Jordan	It's just Jack's old baby crap. We're really excited to get rid of all that stuff and watch you guys suffer through the hellish, relationship-ruining nightmare that is the baby phase.
32718	Carla	Aw.
32719	Jordan	Open something.
32720	Dr. Cox	G'head, g'head.
32721	Dr. Cox	Oh! Those are my workout pants.
32722	Jordan	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
32723	Dr. Cox	She's been trying to get rid of them, but I'll be honest with you. I love them because they're so darn comfortable, and boy, can you get 'em on real quick.
32724	Turk	Ah. You ain't lying!
32725	Dr. Cox	Ah.
32726	Turk	Baby, check it out. Bam, bam, biggida bam bam...
32727	Carla	Wonderful. Thank you.
32728	Keith	Why can't we just talk to people?
32729	Elliot	Because, Keith, this is the baby game station. Once we start playing, other people will join us. OK, guess what flavor baby food this is!
32730	Keith	Cab driver feet?
32731	Elliot	No, Keith! That's turnips! You got it wrong so you gotta finish the whole jar! You guys, this is so much fun!
32732	Elliot	Ugh. Where the hell are all your intern friends?
32733	Dr. Kelso	Listen up, interns. Notice the definition in the upper calf. Look at it, dammit! See that? Back in Nam, the choppers would hover about eight feet over my head and I'd jump in. You should have seen the look on Charlie's face. Not the enemy, son, the pilot, Charlie Norse. Great guy. He didn't make it back. Where's the cake?
32734	Lisa	Eight feet? I don't believe it.
32735	Dr. Kelso	Uhhhh...AHH! Believe that, missy!
32736	J.D.	I have to get ready, man. I want my date with Kim to be perfect. What do you think about a romantic horseback ride on the beach?
32737	Turk	Ooh, like you and I did for your birthday.
32738	J.D.	Yeah, yeah, but except this time with two horses.
32739	Turk	Why not just take her to your deck? You can just lie out, look at the stars?
32740	J.D.	Unfortunately, I can't. My deck has sort of become a cruise-in spot for older, gay gentlemen.
32741	J.D.	Get off my deck, you old queens! Go! HEY! Whose is this?!
32742	J.D.	Whose is this? You find somewhere else to hang out! I know for a fact Les Mis is in town!
32743	J.D.	I tried turning my hose on them, but they liked it.
32744	Turk	Well, if anything, good luck, buddy,
32745	J.D.'s Narration	I didn't need luck because this was going to be the most romantic date ever.
32746	J.D.	Your steed, m'lady.
32747	Kim	J.D.! I've never ridden a horse on the beach before!
32748	J.D.	Upsy-daisy.
32749	Kim	Wow, no saddles. Are you sure you're going to be OK riding bareback?
32750	J.D.	No problemo.
32751	J.D.'s Thoughts	What's so hard about riding bareback?
32752	Kim	Oh, that was amazing! Wasn't that so much fun?
32753	J.D.	Oh, yeah, it was awesome.
32754	Carla	Thank you! Is this for when we buy the baby a dog?
32755	Janitor	No. It's a baby cage! It's a good one, too. See, when I was a kid, mine didn't have these windows. It's perfect. If you want to go out to dinner, there's already, like, a water bottle in there. You just throw some cedar chips in there so the baby can poop and you're made in the shade.
32756	Janitor	I'm kidding. It's for when they buy the baby a — a puppy.
32757	Everyone	Ohh! Ahh! Ohh!
32758	Elliot	Ooh! This one's from me and Keith! Oh, he'd be here but he's in the bathroom throwing up summer squash.
32759	Carla	Oooh!
32760	Elliot	It's a Preggy-Teddy. I got it over at that new maternity lingerie store at the mall. I had a very interesting conversation with the sweet old lady who owns the place. She said not very many pregnant women shop there. It's mostly just fat whores.
32761	Everyone	Oh.
32762	Laverne	I got to get me one of those.
32763	Dr. Cox	Say, Bobbo, do you wanna weigh in on pregnancy sex?
32764	Dr. Kelso	It's a freak show.
32765	Dr. Cox	You've seen an ultrasound? They have eyes, they have hands. How do you think they're going to react to an intruder?
32766	Dr. Kelso & Dr. Cox	UNH!
32767	Turk	The baby can't grab me down there. The baby can't grab me down there.
32768	Carla	No, baby.
32769	Kim	OK, I called an ambulance, but you should really let me examine you.
32770	J.D.	Oh, no, no, no. The date continues.
32771	Kim	J.D., I'm a urologist and there's a good chance you have testicular torsion. In which case, you could lose a testicle. So, come on. Off with the pants.
32772	J.D.	Looks like my plan is working.
32773	Kim	All right, testicular function is normal. OK, one is significantly larger than the other.
32774	J.D.	Actually, that's a preexisting condition.
32775	Kim	So the right one's always been bigger?
32776	J.D.	Yes. Wait, your right or stage right?
32777	Kim	Ugh, let me test the retraction.
32778	J.D.	Retract it.
32779	J.D.'s Thoughts	OK, the date's not going as planned, but you can still save it with your legendary gift for small talk.
32780	J.D.	So, you're from Texas, huh? They say that's the Lone Star State. What exactly does that mean?
32781	Jordan	My boobs are so big right now. Honestly, I think Dr. Fishman threw in a little something extra when he did my chin.
32782	Dr. Cox	Would you — would like to see something really just beautiful?
32783	Jordan	Mmm.
32784	Dr. Cox	There goes all of Jacky-boy's baby stuff.
32785	Janitor	No, Mom! Playpen/baby-cage is not like tomato-tomahto!
32786	Kim	J.D., I hope you're not beating yourself up about this.
32787	J.D.	Oh, Kim, I'm sorry. I wanted to something fun for our first date.
32788	Kim	No, it was so much more fun than you might think. I mean the first seven or eight minutes rocked! Admittedly, it was a little more like work after that, but at least I got to third base with you.
32789	J.D.'s Narration	And there it was. The moment where pity was turning into genuine affection. Classic Dorian.
32790	J.D.	I feel like we kinda missed first base.
32791	Kim	Me too.
32792	J.D.	Well, maybe we should fix that.
32793	Kim	We should.
32794	J.D.'s Narration	And then it happened. Elliot Reid: Moment Killer.
32795	Elliot	What's up, guys? Tell me every detail about the first date.
32796	Kim	We were horseback riding on the beach.
32797	Elliot	Ah, yes, I've been on that date.
32798	Kim	Really?
32799	J.D.	What? I had a coupon.
32800	J.D.'s Narration	I wasn't the only one to have an uninvited guest.
32801	Jordan	Agh, you know what sucks? I didn't eat any of that crappy shower food and I still feel nauseous. In fact, I've been nauseous for like, two weeks.
32802	Jordan	I've been exhausted all week.
32803	Jordan	My boobs are so big right now.
32804	Jordan	Yup. I'm pregnant.
32805	Jack	I pooped in my bed, so I put it on the TV.
32806	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
32807	Open	Dr. Cox's Apartment.
32808	Dr. Cox	Please forgive me, but since I had a vasectomy last year, nay, two vasectomies, I feel — I feel I just have to ask. Did you cheat on me?
32809	Jordan	No. And you know me. I always tell.
32810	Dr. Cox	Well, that's true. That's pretty much why we work well together.
32811	(Cut to hospital hallway. J.D. takes down a poster of himself with the caption	"Old? Gay? Like decks?"
32812	J.D.	Are you responsible for this?
32813	Janitor	What are you talking about? I'm selling my old mop. The 2007's are in.
32814	J.D.	Sorry.
32815	Turk	All right. There she is. We spent all morning crafting a line so raw with confidence, that if you pull it off you're back in the game.
32816	J.D.	I'm afraid, mocha bear.
32817	Turk	I know. Buck up.
32818	J.D.	Hey, Kim.
32819	Kim	Oh, hey, J.D., how are you feeling?
32820	J.D.	Well, uh, the swelling's gone down... for now.
32821	Kim	You're an idiot! Ha ha ha!
32822	J.D.	Go out with me again tonight.
32823	Kim	Oh, J.D., I would love to, but I'm going to a Neil Diamond concert.
32824	J.D.	With who?
32825	J.D.'s Narration	Elliot Reid: Moment Killer.
32826	Elliot	What's up?
32827	Kim	Oh, hey girl.
32828	Elliot	Are so you psyched?
32829	Kim	I'm so psyched.
32830	Elliot	Me too.
32831	Turk	Everywhere around the world, they're coming to America.
32832	Dr. Cox	Could I, uh, could I have everybody's attention please? Jordan's pregnant.
32833	Elliot	Oh, you get over here, you!
32834	Jordan	Not a hug moment, sweetie.
32835	Elliot	Right. Yes. No.
32836	Dr. Cox	Mm.
32837	Dr. Cox	But, Dr. Cox, here I thought you and Jordan were done trying to have any more babies.
32838	Dr. Cox	We were, but my vasectomy didn't take, which apparently is not that uncommon.
32839	Dr. Cox	Holy crap, Dr. Cox. That must have really pissed you off.
32840	Dr. Cox	Yes, it did, actually. What is — what is your name?
32841	Dr. Cox	Oh, I'm any generic hospital worker who happens to ask you a question about your pregnancy and/or baby related issues.
32842	Dr. Cox	Oh, isn't that nice. You're done.
32843	Dr. Cox	This morality play was made possible by a generous grant from the Just See If I Was Kidding Foundation.
32844	Carla	Do you wanna do it or should I?
32845	Turk	Let's just do it together, all right?
32846	Turk & Carla	MAAHAAA!!
32847	Dr. Kelso	That's from the Simpsons.
32848	Elliot	Ahh.
32849	Turk	I'm gonna have a heart attack.
32850	Carla	Did you guys hear what Jordan and Dr. Cox did to the guy doctor who botched his vasectomy?
32851	Jordan	Go, Ted.
32852	Dr. Fulton	Don't they ever say ribs?
32853	Dr. Cox	Never. They never say ribs.
32854	Turk	I heard ten minutes into it, he started eating his own face.
32855	Carla	He did.
32856	Elliot	Well, you know what J.D.'s got planned since it's his day off and he's dateless?
32857	J.D.	This is my first scooter rally. Do you want to be Paunch or John?
32858	Carla	I can imagine what Jordan and Dr. Cox are feeling right now.
32859	Jordan	Do you really think we can handle this?
32860	Dr. Cox	I don't know.
32861	Elliot's Voiceover	I can totally picture J.D., too.
32862	J.D.	Oh, hey, Mom. No, I'm just hanging out alone tonight. I just didn't really have anything else to do.
32863	Carla	We want to give you your stuff back.
32864	Dr. Cox	We don't feel like dealing with that stuff right now.
32865	Turk	How about now?
32866	Dr. Cox	Mm. Come on in.
32867	Carla	Hmm.
32868	J.D.'s Thoughts	Ugh, I hate cleaning up after those messy, old queens.
32869	J.D.'s Thoughts	Ooh, appletini. When did they start drinking straight-guy drinks? Mmm. It's fresh.
32870	Kim	What's up, chicken butt?
32871	J.D.	Hey, Kim. What happened to Neil Diamond?
32872	Elliot	I haven't seen Keith in a while, so I'm gonna take him instead. Kim's letting me off the hook.
32873	J.D.	Thank you.
32874	Elliot	You're welcome.
32875	J.D.	What's up?
32876	Kim	Nothing.
32877	J.D.'s Narration	It seems like good friends always come through for you.
32878	Turk	You like it?
32879	Dr. Cox	Yeah, I like it. I can wear 'em out to dinner. With a sports jacket?
32880	Jordan	No.
32881	Dr. Cox	Oh.
32882	Carla	It's OK, don't get up, I got it. Uhh!
32883	Turk	OK.
32884	Carla	It's only your child. Look. I feel like I can give you a list of things that are sucky about being pregnant. For starters, I am now horny as I've ever been and my husband is repulsed by me.
32885	Turk	Listen, if you really need it that badly, I will suck it up and shut my eyes so tight and then do you.
32886	Carla	Thank you for the sacrifice.
32887	Turk	It's because I love you.
32888	Carla	My point is, even with all that crap, I'm sure it's all been worth it. I've seen how happy having Jack has made you two. And yeah, I know it's been hard, but I know that neither one of you regret any of it.
32889	Turk	What the hell is this thing?
32890	Dr. Cox	That's Jack's mobile. Actually, it's his third mobile. The first two were deeply embedded in the drywall. They can be quite frustrating to assemble.
32891	Jordan	Do you remember when he was teething and he would stare at that thing for hours?
32892	Dr. Cox	Yep.
32893	Turk	Why does your TV smell like doodoo?
32894	J.D.	So what do you want to do tonight?
32895	Kim	Why don't we just hang here and look at the stars until we're comfortable to make out a little?
32896	J.D.	OK. I'm cool with that.
32897	Kim	Not yet.
32898	J.D.	OK, you let me know.
32899	J.D.'s Narration	And like that, I felt like all was right with the couples in the world.
32900	Kim	OK, now.
32901	J.D.'s Narration	And right then, I knew this was the start of something important.

32903	Title Card	Two And A Half Weeks Later
32904	Open	Kim's apartment. J.D. knocks on the door with a bunch of flowers. Kim answers.
32905	J.D.	Two and a half weeks is too long to wait for a third date.
32906	Kim	I'm pregnant.
32907	J.D.	What now?
32908	Title Card	To Be Continued
32909	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
32910	Jordan	Welcome home, Perry. Here's the new program: You occasionally lift a finger helping with Jack, and I'm gonna try to keep from hating the unborn baby in my belly that's made my ass so big, I can't fit the whole thing on a toilet when I pee eight hundred times a day! I can't.
32911	Dr. Cox	You love spaghetti. You had some just last night, didn't ya?
32912	Jack	No, I didn't!
32913	Dr. Cox	Jordan, the boy is lying to me.
32914	Jordan	Oh, Perry, nobody likes a tattle-tail!
32915	Jack	Nobody does, Perry!
32916	Dr. Cox	All right, champ. Just in case you get hungry later on....
32917	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
32918	Turk	Yo, Elliot...what's your ringtone?
32919	Elliot	"Jesus, Take the Wheel" by Carrie Underwood.
32920	Todd	I'm carrying underwood right now. See, that's funny because it's true. Please?
32921	Elliot	But that's all you get for the rest of the year, Todd.
32922	Turk	I'm downloading 'N Sync's "Bye Bye Bye." When that bad boy starts a-jumpin', I defy anyone not to shake their butt to it. I'm bringing it back.
32923	Elliot	Just like you brought back Pop-Rocks?
32924	Turk	Teddy boy!
32925	Elliot	Yeah, well, you're not as big a trend-setter as you think you are. Right, Keith?
32926	Elliot	Ohh.
32927	J.D.'s Narration	As for me, I spent my free time getting coworkers I just met pregnant.
32928	J.D.	You're pregnant? Are you sure?
32929	Kim	I'm pretty sure.
32930	J.D.	Uh, Kim, I'm not really sure how to phrase this, so I'm just gonna dive right in: Have there been other penises?
32931	Kim	It's yours, J.D.
32932	J.D.	Cool.
32933	Kim	Are you okay?
32934	J.D.'s Thoughts	Aaaaauuuuugggggghhhhhh!!!!!!
32935	J.D.	Yeah. I don't think I've ever seen the inside of your apartment before.
32936	Kim	Said the father of my unborn child. Heh!
32937	J.D.	Well, that's different, Kim, that's hilarious. This is life-changing.
32938	Kim	We can get through this.
32939	J.D.	You know what else is pretty classic when the coffee guy asks for money, you say, "Sorry, my wallet's in my other pair of mocha-chinos." That always gets 'em.
32940	Kim	Ah, dammit. I have to go to the hospital.
32941	J.D.	Scone is also a a funny word; but I don't like them, I prefer croissants.
32942	Kim	You're clearly freaking out, so, um, you need to promise me that you're gonna find somebody to talk to about this while I'm gone.
32943	J.D.	Please! I'll be fine. You be careful you're walking for two!
32944	J.D.	Call Turk.
32945	Elliot	You were right, Turk.
32946	Turk	Hell, yeah!
32947	Dr. Kelso	All right! All right! Now listen! This is a hospital, not a discotheque! Turn that damn thing off!
32948	J.D.	Come on, buddy. Please pick up.
32949	Dr. Kelso	This is pretty catchy.
32950	All	Awwwwww!
32951	J.D.'s Thoughts	No problem. I'll just go chill at my deck with a little vino.
32952	J.D.'s Narration	Unfortunately, it was still a hangout spot for gay seniors.
32953	J.D.	All right! That's enough! I have seen Les Mis over a dozen times, so I have nothing against giant queens per se, all right? In fact, my life would be a whole lot easier if I was married to one of you guys.... Excuse me.
32954	Queen	You heard him, girls. Let's roll!
32955	Gays	Yeah! Wooo!
32956	J.D. zips around a corner, giving the pursuing gays the slip as he sneaks into a door, without noticing the sign on it	STAGE DOOR
32957	Turk	Hold up! Hold up! Hold up! "Las Vegas Police Department." Hello?
32958	J.D.	Why didn't you answer your phone when I called you?
32959	Turk	I was dancing.
32960	J.D.	Ohhhh. Wait, let me hear it.
32961	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
32962	J.D.	There it is.
32963	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
32964	Kim	Well, look, I'm in surgery all morning, but we can meet for lunch, talk this through then, okay?
32965	Kim	J.D., this is a really bad connection.
32966	J.D.	Ted, please!
32967	J.D.	Ted!
32968	J.D.	Okay, I'll see you at lunch.
32969	Janitor	Hey, mojambo. This here's our new flagpole. Why don't you show Old Glory a little respect and snap off a salute?
32970	J.D.	There's no flag up there.
32971	Janitor	We're at war, my friend. All American flags are on backorder. What do you want me to do in the meantime, run a pirate flag up there? Maybe turn the whole building into a pirate ship? I could put a captain's wheel up on the roof...catch a parrot somehow...slap on an eyepatch...go to work with a caulk-gun, seal her up, make her watertight I can take her out to sea.
32972	J.D.	Are you insane?
32973	Janitor	Nah. I'm a pirate.
32974	J.D.	Whatever. I'm I I I'm not saluting a pole!
32975	Janitor	And so it begins...again.
32976	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
32977	J.D.	My life is over.
32978	Dr. Cox	Oh, come on, you gotta focus on the positives. For instance, the medical miracle that is one woman actually impregnating another woman. Shadaisy!
32979	Turk	Coincidentally, I have a cousin named Shadaisy!
32980	Dr. Cox	What?
32981	Carla	J.D. needs us right now, okay? So this is what we're gonna do: Dr. Cox, you're backing off. Elliot, you go talk to him.
32982	Elliot	Can't wait to talk to J.D. Maybe we can chat about how everyone in this frickin' hospital, other than me, is having a baby. I mean, seriously, having a baby, having a baby, having a second baby! Or having her husband's best friend's baby! That's right, Mona, everyone knows!
32983	Dr. Beardface	It's Beardfacé, dammit!
32984	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
32985	Dr. Cox	Gather round, doomed new interns who just paged me! Quick question: What does this outfit tell you?
32986	Dr. Kelso	You...are entering a Joe Piscopo look-alike contest?
32987	Dr. Cox	It means that I was just working out which, incidentally, is the last remaining activity I have in my adult life that qualifies as "me time." Other activities recently crossed off of that list include my morning dump and all showers. You see, my dear son Jack has decided that those are team sports. However, I'm here, and I'm totally psyched to hear whatever the super-de-duper reason is that you paged me.
32988	Male Intern	Mr. White's chart said to remove his eight stitches, but we counted nine. Should we leave one?
32989	Dr. Cox	That's it. Every single one of you is gonna run laps around the hallways until I say stop.
32990	Dr. Cox	Think I'm kidding? Shyah! Shyah! Shyah shyah shyah! Shyah!
32991	Jordan	Perry? What the hell? I just got a call from Jack's school. Apparently they served spaghetti for lunch, so he had some sort of Vietnam flashback.
32992	Dr. Cox	I don't have any anger issues.
32993	Female Intern	Dr. Cox, I'm sorry, but my asthma...is really...starting...to....
32994	Dr. Cox	GET OUTTA HERE!
32995	Jordan	Seriously?
32996	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
32997	Mr. O'Neil	What are you working on, young man?
32998	Janitor	New ways to torture that guy. See?
32999	J.D.	Mrs. Zeebee, I know that we were hoping that the pain around your areola was simple mastitis, but it turns out that it's breast cancer.
33000	Mrs. ZeeBee	I can't believe this is happening to me.
33001	J.D.	Trust me, I know what you're going through. Just yesterday, I found out that my girlfriend
33002	Turk	'Scuse us!
33003	Turk	Dude, please tell me you're not comparing getting cancer to knocking up your girlfriend.
33004	J.D.	I was trying to!
33005	Turk	You can't pawn your personal stuff off on your patients!
33006	J.D.	What about you and the motorcycle accident guy!?
33007	Turk	So get this: My pregnant wife has decided that it's okay to steal my pillow in the middle of the night and sleep with it in between her legs!
33008	Patient	When am I going in to surgery?
33009	Turk	Oh, we can't start the surgery until the troopers find your foot.
33010	Turk	That was different. He said, "What's up?"
33011	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
33012	Dr. Cox	Hardly seems like much of a punishment for the kid from Kenya. I mean, God's sake, he could run all day.
33013	Carla	You know, maybe Jordan's right maybe it's time you start dealing with your anger issues?
33014	Dr. Cox	Carla, for something to be an issue, it needs to cause a problem. I mean, honestly, aside from having to by law remain thirty feet away from a certain telemarketer who I visited while he was eating his dinner, I don't see the downside.
33015	Carla	Mr. Slydell here is suffering from peptic ulcer disease and hypertension two conditions you'll often see in very angry people.
33016	Dr. Cox	Now, now, you don't know that this gentleman is angry.
33017	Mr. Slydell	Damn it! Why won't this TV go on!?!?
33018	Carla	That was the bed remote.
33019	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
33020	Keith	Ted, I...I got the cola. Did you get the Pop Rocks?
33021	Ted	No, the vending machine was out, so I went to the generic store and got some "Fizzy Pebbles."
33022	Keith	Sure we should do this?
33023	Ted	I'm sick of legends and hearsay, Keith! I have to know!
33024	Janitor	No scuffing. No scuffing!
33025	Mr. O'Neil	But if it doesn't work, you'll just be an older, fairly ugly, janitor woman.
33026	Janitor	That's true.
33027	Mr. O'Neil	You know, you and I are quite a bit alike. I spent most of my life trying to become a lawyer. But I could never get my juris doctorate.
33028	Janitor	How does that make us alike?
33029	Mr. O'Neil	Ohh, I spent years trying to get that damn J.D....
33030	Ted	Ah-ha-haaaa! Hey! It's alive!
33031	Keith	Woo-hooooooo! Wooooo!
33032	Janitor	Hey! That'll be fun to clean up!
33033	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
33034	J.D.	You know what's so messed up about this whole baby thing? I mean, I feel like I'm drowning, and it hasn't even fazed Kim.
33035	Kim	Okay, let's, uh, close her up.
33036	Nurse	Dr. Briggs? Why are you crying?
33037	Kim	This song always gets me.
33038	Kim	My brother was killed by a funky cold medina.
33039	Carla	I'm sorry, J.D., but you knew that this could happen when you had sex.
33040	J.D.	I have to tell you guys something, but you have to promise not to laugh, okay?
33041	Carla	Oh, no, absolutely.
33042	Turk	I'll try.
33043	Elliot	Right. Sure.
33044	J.D.	Okay, on the night of said conception, uh, Kim and I nuded up, and um...the dirty talk began, and I got a little over-excited.
33045	Turk	Ooooh! She like-a the dirty talk!
33046	J.D.	No, I do. I find it gets the ladies going, but I occasionally get wrapped up in it myself, especially when I use some of my different voices....
33047	Elliot	He does.
33048	J.D.	Anyhoo, there was some unexpected friendly fire. And, uh, even though I never got a chance to enter..."the village"...uh, there was a..."airstrike" on one of the outlying regions
33049	Turk	Thank you.
33050	J.D.	Anyway, I spoke to the gals up in OB-G, and they said it's not uncommon for a woman to get pregnant even if there was no actual penetration.
33051	Turk	What you trying to tell us is that you...never actually had sex with her?
33052	J.D.	No, I didn't have a condom.
33053	J.D.	And, uh, we decided not to have sex because here's the kicker I didn't want to get her pregnant.
33054	Turk	Oh, no you didn't!
33055	J.D.'s Narration	As I thought about how Mrs. Zeebee and I had gotten such a raw deal, I realized how easy it was for doctors to see themselves in their patients.
33056	J.D.'s Narration	Whether it's in the choices they made in their life...
33057	Mr. Slydell	My anger not only cost me my health, it also cost me my job, my marriage...it cost me damn near everything.
33058	Dr. Cox	You're killing me.
33059	J.D.'s Narration	...or the choices they didn't make...
33060	Mr. O'Neil	I was so obsessed with getting my J.D. that I never did the things I really wanted to do start a family, see the world....
33061	Janitor	Punch a whale?
33062	Mr. O'Neil	No, I punched a whale, right in the face. Down he went, like Liston.
33063	J.D.'s Narration	Either way, it forces you to face your problems head-on.
33064	Kim	There you are. You ready to grab some lunch so that we can talk?
33065	J.D.'s Narration	Or not.
33066	J.D.	You know what, Kim, I don't think I can handle this right now.
33067	Kim	Oh, okay. Yeah. That's great. Um....
33068	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
33069	Turk	Heads up.
33070	Kim	Hey.
33071	Turk	Hey.
33072	Kim	You seen J.D.?
33073	Turk	I have not.
33074	Kim	Any idea where he is?
33075	Turk	Teaching CPR to underprivileged youth at Lincoln Middle School on 18th Street.
33076	J.D.'s Thoughts	I can't believe he got that! We are so ready for that charades tournament on Saturday!
33077	Kim	Come on, Turk, where is he?
33078	Turk	You know, Kim, I'm sorry but I really have no idea.

33082	Elliot and Interns	"Slide down the lily pad and go ker-plop!"
33083	Dr. Cox	Space-wasters, why haven't any of you placed a pulmonary artery cath on this guy?
33084	Elliot	Hey, let's try to use our inside voice around the interns. We don't want to scare them.
33085	Dr. Cox	What kind of new crazy is this?
33086	Carla	Oh, Elliot snapped a little and decided the interns were her babies.
33087	Elliot	Oops, Jakie. Somebody's got a little smudgie on his face. There you go.
33088	Dr. Cox	Long as he gets done.
33089	Carla	Um, why doesn't Elliot have a freshly-ripped new one right now?
33090	Dr. Cox	I'm not freshly ripping anybody anything anymore. I am done with anger.
33091	Jordan	Oh, is that gonna be like the time you quit drinking? 'Cause that was the longest twenty minutes of my life!
33092	Dr. Cox	Your sarcasm is wasted on me, you giant pregnant beast. This is an anger-free zone. There's no anger here. Oh! Guh! Counter! Ha ha haaaaa!
33093	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
33094	Janitor	I filled it with blue Gatorade. I just do that to freak people out.
33095	Dr. Kelso	Scintillating.
33096	Janitor	Say, since we're small talking, let me let me ask you a question: Do you have any...regrets about the way you lived your life? 'Cause I think I do.
33097	Dr. Kelso	You've never been to Paris and cleaned a French toilet, huh?
33098	Janitor	Oh! Haha, good one. No, that's not it. Come on, be straight with me. Do you think I'm wasting my life?
33099	Dr. Kelso	Let's cut to the chase, freak-show. If you're a 44-year-old man wearing a jumpsuit and you are not climbing into the cockpit of a rocket ship, chances are you've made a lot of wrong turns along the way. Good talk!
33100	Janitor	Hmm.

33102	Turk	Dude, what the hell am I supposed to tell Kim when she asks why I drove off like that?
33103	J.D.	Tell her you hate white chicks. And then when she says, "No you don't," you say, "I mean 'White Chicks' the movie not a fan of those Wayans brothers." Then she'll laugh and forget why she was mad at you.
33104	Turk	You're right! That'll work. But still, you need to man up and talk to her.
33105	J.D.	You have no idea what I'm going through.
33106	Turk	Really? 'Cause the last time I checked, I was having a kid, too.
33107	J.D.	Yeah, that you planned with your wife, whose middle name you know.
33108	Turk	I knew it was something Puerto Rican.
33109	J.D.	What if Kim and I don't end up together? Okay? I already have enough trouble meeting girls. Can you imagine it now? "Hey, how you doin'? I'm J.D., and this little bugger right here already hates ya for not being his real mommy! Wanna get freaky? I'm apparently very fertile!"
33110	Turk	Dude, I'm your best friend I'll tell you whatever you want me to.

33112	Dr. Cox	Say, Barbie? Have you seen any of the interns around?
33113	Elliot	Yeah. They did so well at rounds, I'm just letting them watch a show.
33114	Dr. Cox	Oh. Hi, interns.
33115	Interns	Hi.
33116	Dr. Cox	Look, you pretty obviously have short-circuited. Because the odds of you ever actually having a baby are roughly on a par with me finding the Loch Ness monster in my bathtub.
33117	Intern	Shh! I can't hear the TV!
33118	Dr. Cox	Okay, ahaho!
33119	Dr. Cox	Hi, honey!
33120	Dr. Cox	Hyah! Go on, get outta here! Come on! You too! Get outta here! Hyah!
33121	Carla	Mr. Slydell's ulcer perforated and he bled out. He's dead.
33122	Turk	Well, if it isn't my beautiful bride, Carla Juanita Espinosa.
33123	Carla	Juanita? You think my middle name is Juanita?
33124	Turk	I am going to kill J.D.!
33125	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
33126	Dr. Kelso	Uh, Dr. Dorian, look, uh, this is a bit awkward, but, uh, as chief of medicine, I feel obligated to ask you about your relationship with Dr. Briggs.... Was she naughty? I bet she's a hellcat.
33127	J.D.	Get help, sir.
33128	Dr. Kelso	Never mind. It's, uh, better up here.
33129	Nurse Roberts	Mrs. Zeebee's CAT-scan came back.
33130	J.D.'s Thoughts	Oh, man. This just sucks.
33131	J.D.	Mrs. Zeebee, unfortunately the cancer isn't localized just to your breast. We're gonna have to start chemo right away.
33132	J.D.'s Narration	The most important thing to remember when you see yourself in a patient is that they're not actually you.
33133	J.D.'s Narration	In fact, sometimes, they're actually who we wish we had the courage to be.
33134	Mrs. Zeebee	You know what? I'm gonna get through this. Just you watch.
33135	J.D.	Yeah.
33136	J.D.'s Narration	Right then, I knew exactly what I had to do, come hell or high water.
33137	J.D.	Whoa! Oof!
33138	Turk	Uh-huh! I got your Juanita. Juanita, huh? Well you can Jua-nita this right there.
33139	J.D.	What the hell?
33140	Janitor	It's now or never.
33141	J.D.	Are you gonna let me down anytime soon?
33142	Janitor	Not until you spend a little time acting like a flag.
33143	J.D.'s Narration	As I acted like a flag, I sensed that the Janitor learned nothing from this experience.
33144	J.D.'s Narration	Dr. Cox, on the other hand, got halfway there. He may always be angry at work, but he had learned to control himself when it counts.
33145	Dr. Cox	Jacky, would you like some hot dogs?
33146	Jack	I don't want hot dogs!
33147	Dr. Cox	That's okay, 'cause we've got your favorite yogurt.
33148	J.D.'s Narration	As for me, I finally came through, even if it was a little late.
33149	J.D.	Can we talk?
33150	Kim	That'd be great.
33151	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
33152	Jack	You're a fatty fatty fatty fatty fatty fatty fatty fatty fatty!
33153	Woman	What's your son doing?
33154	Dr. Cox	Apparently he's doing the "fatty dance." Inappropriate? Well, maybe. But I'm raising my son to be a straight-shooter. That's his mom, right over there.
33155	Jordan	Ohh, thanks for including me.
33156	J.D.'s Narration	Dr. Cox and Jordan weren't the only ones with kid troubles. My brand new girlfriend was pregnant, and we were trying to decide what to do.
33157	J.D.	Should we keep it or get rid of it?
33158	Kim	I dunno. If we keep it, it'll just end up in the dumpster.
33159	J.D.	You're right.
33160	Kim	So, uh, let's go.... Um.... Do you like kids?
33161	J.D.	Of course I do! What about you? Any nieces or nephews?
33162	Kim	Yeah, I have a nephew. Although he's forty-five. But occasionally I do have to change his diaper he was kicked by a horse.
33163	J.D.	Oh, no!
33164	Kim	Yeah.
33165	Old J.D.	So beautiful! I hope you keep some ice in this locket, 'cause you're making me hot all over!
33166	Girl	Actually, it's the only picture I have of my biological father. D'you wanna see it?
33167	Old J.D.	What? Oh! Sure! Uh, I'll take a look at it first thing tomorrow morning, huh?
33168	J.D.	Yeah, I'm not a big fan of adoption.
33169	Kim	You think if it's a girl, you'd doink her?
33170	J.D.	I know I will.
33171	Kim	Yep. All right, well, look, we don't need to make this decision tonight, right? I mean, plenty of time.
33172	J.D.	I'm totally fine with stalling.
33173	Kim	Great! 'Cause if I hear the word "baby" one more time, I'm gonna lose it!
33174	Turk	Dude! Carla's in labor! Meet me at the apartment! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
33175	Turk	Is he coming? Is he coming!?
33176	Elliot	Turk, she's barely in labor.
33177	Carla	Oh, he's not talking about the baby.
33178	Turk	He's here! And now we can have our baby!
33179	J.D.	Okay, Brown Bear, commence Operation Brown Cub! Suitcase!
33180	Turk	Check.
33181	J.D.	Stylish big daddy hat!
33182	Turk	Check.
33183	J.D.	Big-time collegiate drum-line!
33184	Turk	Check!
33185	Turk	I want the whole world to know my baby's having a baby!
33186	Carla	Maybe we should just take your car!
33187	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
33188	J.D.	'Kay, ladies, we're here; calm down.
33189	Carla	What the hell took you so long? Oh, my God, did you stop for food?
33190	Turk	We had to, honey. J.D. promised the band that we'd feed them.
33191	J.D.	Yeah, let me get twenty-three cheeseburgers, twenty-three milkshakes Miguel, if you don't stop drumming, you're not getting fries.
33192	J.D.	Miguel has such raw talent, but his attitude keeps getting in the way.
33193	Elliot	Unbelievable.
33194	Dr. Cox	Yay, congratulations, whoopee, all right, see ya.
33195	Jordan	Eh eh eh eh eh. Heh heh.
33196	Jordan	We are so happy for you!
33197	Jack	
33198	Subtitle	I'm a helicopter, I'm a helicopter, I'm a helicopter.
33199	Kim	He's so sweet!
33200	Jordan	Mm.
33201	Kim	You put one of those inside me! What are we gonna do?
33202	Carla	Turk, you brought my suitcase, right?
33203	Turk	Of course I have your suitcase, honey.
33204	J.D.	What are you doing?
33205	Turk	Sometimes when you need a miracle, you have to pray extra-extra hard. You wanna help me out?
33206	J.D.	Fo' shizzle.
33207	Turk	Please, Lord.
33208	Turk	Nothing! Okay.
33209	Carla	Turk! What the hell?
33210	Elliot	It's okay. It's okay, Carla, because I packed you an extra overnight bag, and you're all checked in, and I got you an orderly to take you to your room.
33211	Jordan	Yeah, I'm only four months pregnant, ace.
33212	Carla	Oh, yeah, I think you're looking for me.
33213	Jordan	Move it along before I eat you! Chop chop.
33214	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
33215	Dr. Cox	Ah. Sorry, Jack, the machine's broken. Looks like you're gonna have to guzzle your juice down without any ice. Pretend, um.... You know, pretend it's gin.
33216	Jack	What's gin?
33217	Dr. Cox	Gin is an alcoholic beverage which, if your mommy's strong genes are any indication, you'll eventually learn to love as it slowly destroys a giant portion of your adult life.
33218	Jordan	First the fat lady, now this? He's three, Perry! Do you have to be so blunt with him?
33219	Dr. Cox	I'm not gonna B.S. my own kid. What's the big deal?
33220	Dr. Kelso	Hiya, sport!
33221	Jack	Your skin is wrinkly.
33222	Dr. Kelso	Yeah? Well that shirt you're wearing is gay!
33223	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
33224	Turk	Hey, baby. I know things haven't exactly gone smoothly so far, but I promise you I'm about to make it up to you. I spent all weekend talking to my cousin who just so happens to be the world's biggest blerd.
33225	Elliot	Ohhh.
33226	Turk	Anyway, he taught me everything about streaming video; and now, thanks to me, your sisters in Chicago will be able to witness the birth of our child live via webcam!
33227	Carla	Turk! That's so sweet!
33228	Turk	You know, I do what I do.
33229	Carla	Camera man? Nuh-uh! No man's gonna me filming my pooter unless he's completely asexual!
33230	Ted	Hello!
33231	Carla	Oh! Hey, Ted! Cool.
33232	Turk	All right. I'ma go tell your sisters that this bad boy is about to pop off.
33233	Dr. Matthews	All right, Carla. Let's check how dilated you are.
33234	Ted	Looking real good, Carla. Okay, we're live in three, two, one....
33235	Dr. Matthews	Okay. Looks like you're at about three centimeters.
33236	Todd	Greatest show ever!
33237	Dr. Kelso	And...record.
33238	Janitor	Cool! Swamp thing!
33239	Jack	What's that, daddy?
33240	Dr. Cox	Oh, that's the vagina of a 35-year-old Latina woman.
33241	Turk	Baby?
33242	Carla	What the!?!?
33243	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
33244	Kim	J.D., we have to talk about all of our pregnancy options, even if they make us uncomfortable. There's one way of dealing with this that no one's mention yet.... The A-word.
33245	J.D.	I know....
33246	J.D.	Appletinis
33247	Kim	Abortions.
33248	Kim	What?
33249	J.D.	I thought that we could discuss abortion over appletinis.
33250	Nurse Roberts	Did somebody just say "abortion"?
33251	Kim	Laverne, with all due respect, this is none of your business. Or Jesus's.
33252	Nurse Roberts	I believe He would beg to differ.
33253	Jesus	She's right, J.D. Every life is precious.
33254	J.D.	But what if having this baby is a huge mistake for us?
33255	Jesus	Okay, I'm gonna make this real simple: No abortions, okay?
33256	J.D.	But what if
33257	Jesus	No abortions!
33258	J.D.	Lemme finish! What if the parents were like abusive drug addicts who would neglect their kids?
33259	Jesus	Oh, well, in that case it'd be okay.
33260	J.D.	Really?
33261	Jesus	NO ABORTIONS! How are you not getting this!?
33262	Kim	This sucks. I mean, the hardest decision I've had to make in the last year was what hairstyle to get. And even then, all I did was open up an US Magazine, close my eyes and pick a random celebrity.
33263	J.D.	Kirsten Dunst?
33264	Kim	Owen Wilson.
33265	J.D.	Ohhh!
33266	Kim	Yeah.
33267	Kim	You know what's making this so hard? This relationship is so new, we can't tell if we have a chance of making this work long-term.
33268	J.D.	You know what might give us an inkling? We haven't technically had sex yet. That might help us find out if we're on the same page...you know...in the boudoir.
33269	Kim	Are you hitting on me?
33270	J.D.	I'm sorry, I'm being an idiot, aren't I.
33271	Kim	Nope. Clothes off. We're doing it.
33272	J.D.	Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...!
33273	J.D.	...Yeah!
33274	Kim	That's that's exactly what we should do we should make a list of pros and cons.
33275	Jesus	What did you two just do? Because I sure don't see any wedding rings!
33276	J.D.	Laverne? Is this your Jesus?
33277	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
33278	Todd	Turk, I got your shift covered so you could hang here. Oh, and Carla, there's something I wanted to tell you.... Oh: Great vagina!
33279	Turk	So helpful!
33280	Carla	Don't take it out on The Todd! He was just giving me a compliment! Thank you, Todd.
33281	Todd	Hey, happy to say it.
33282	Carla	So what's next, Turk? Because so far, I'm half deaf from a drum-line, I have no suitcase, and the entire hospital has seen Miss Priscilla!
33283	Elliot	Oh, my God! So did I! Mr. Hebbler.
33284	Carla	Ew.
33285	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
33286	Kim	Okay, let me just read the last of the cons: We're not married, we're both totally focused on our careers, babies are known to be sticky, and the average cost of raising a child is four-hundred-thousand dollars.
33287	J.D.	Okay. Here are the final pros: Kids are great
33288	Kim	Yes.
33289	J.D.	we both make good money
33290	Kim	Yes.
33291	J.D.	your boobs'll get huge
33292	Kim	True.
33293	J.D.	I can finally buy Beanie Babies without feeling weird, and kids are great!
33294	Kim	Which we already said.
33295	J.D.	Tax deductions!
33296	Kim	Ohhh! Nice one!
33297	J.D.	Ohhh! Yeah! That's some
33298	Kim	All right, so then what's the final tally?
33299	J.D.	Nice. Let's see, that's twenty cons and nineteen pros. I guess we gotta abort.
33300	Kim	Yep.
33301	J.D.	Wait, I'm sorry. That's an eyelash, I made a wish. It's a tie abortion's off.
33302	Kim	Okay, so now what?
33303	J.D.'s Narration	Every couple has its share of problems.
33304	Jordan	Congrats, Perry. My son just asked me if my vagina had ever been on television.
33305	Dr. Cox	And did you tell him not since the late 'eighties when you were trying to make it as "an actress"?
33306	J.D.'s Narration	Whether it's someone digging in...
33307	Jordan	Will you just cut the crap and stop treating your son like he's your drinking buddy?
33308	Dr. Cox	Look, I'm not going to change who I am, all right? End o' story.
33309	J.D.'s Narration	...or someone stealing your thunder.
33310	Elliot	Okay, candles are all lit lavender scented, your favorite. And here's a picture of your mom to watch over you . And then I've got this kit in case you want to bronze the umbilical cord and use it for a keychain. I practiced at home on some calamari.
33311	Carla	Elliot, you're amazing.
33312	Turk	We hey, is there anything I can do to help?
33313	Carla	Elliot's got everything covered.
33314	J.D.'s Narration	Still, nothing's worse than facing the biggest decision of your life and not getting anywhere.
33315	Kim	Don't you wish it was this easy head's yes, tail's no.
33316	J.D.	You don't see that every day.
33317	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
33318	Kim	You know what? We're getting nowhere. Let's split up for an hour and do some soul-searching.
33319	J.D.	Where're you going?
33320	Kim	Oh, I was just gonna walk around.
33321	J.D.	All right, Justin. What should my specialty be, oncology or radiology?
33322	J.D.	I go someplace wonderful.
33323	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
33324	Jordan	Anyway, I was thinking we need new table linens for the dining room. Well, not so much table linens as placemats. What do think's prettier, burgundy or mauve?
33325	Dr. Kelso	What the hell's with her?
33326	Dr. Cox	She's mad. But she can't give me the silent treatment because she knows I'd actually love that, so she's giving me the talk-until-I-want-to-commit-suicide treatment.
33327	Dr. Kelso	Sucks to be you.
33328	Dr. Cox	You have no idea.
33329	Jordan	...What else do I need for that? Oh, I need new pillow shams. And I I like cotton, but I think we should get a cotton blend because that's easier to clean, and I hate ironing. Maybe we need a new housekeeper. Maybe the housekeeper should come every single day now.
33330	Turk	Look, Elliot, I'm really trying to be involved in the birth of my child, but you just keep boxing me out.
33331	Elliot	That is not true. Now, outta my way I've gotta order the birth announcements, put in the carseat, and find a yard to bury the placenta.
33332	Keith	It's true. Sometimes she makes me wear a diaper.
33333	Elliot	Keith! Private!
33334	J.D.	So what is Elliot's plan?
33335	Turk	Ah, it's really simple: See, when Carla says "I'm thirsty," Elliot'll say, "Oh no, I forgot the ice chips." That's when I walk in, ice in hand, and I say, "Christopher Turk, at your cervix!"
33336	J.D.	Ahh! Should I have a baby, too?
33337	Turk	You know, I'm a little preoccupied right now. Why don't you ask your unicorn?
33338	J.D.	Ah, this is way over Justin's head. He's never been in love. Not real love, anyway.
33339	Turk	What's up with the ice?
33340	Kim	I don't know what to do. I mean, having a baby can completely ruin your life, you know? Not to mention, as a urologist, I have seen what childbirth can do to you down there. Heh. I mean, I examined this one woman last month and it was like "Hello...hello...hello...hello..."
33341	Carla	Not a good time, Kim!
33342	Elliot	Really? Uh.... Unfortunately...I forgot the ice chips.
33343	Turk	Dude, help! I'm totally stuck!
33344	J.D.	Why don't you just yank it out?
33345	Leonard	I would not do that.
33346	&	That's how it happened!
33347	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
33348	Elliot	Ice chips! Ice chips! Ice ice! Chips chips!
33349	Keith	Hey, guys. Carla, let me just see how far you can reach here. Okay, perfect. Turk would like you to call him because he's stuck in an ice machine.
33350	Carla	What?!?!
33351	Keith	See, that's why I took the precaution. Heh.
33352	Carla	Kim, would you be a sweetie and give Turk a call for me?
33353	Kim	Yes, ma'am.
33354	Turk	Hey, baby, look, I ... Yeah, he he's right here. ... Hold on.
33355	J.D.	Hi. ... Yes, I know he missed your wedding, too. ... All right, hold on.
33356	Turk	Go.
33357	Janitor	Relax, I'll have him out in one second.
33358	Turk	NOOO!
33359	Janitor	He's being unreasonable. ... Okay.
33360	Turk	Aaaaaggghhh!
33361	Turk	Oh!
33362	Janitor	That was from me.
33363	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
33364	J.D.	Hey there.
33365	Kim	Hey.
33366	J.D.	So...you decided what you wanna do?
33367	Kim	Okay.
33368	J.D.	One, two, three.
33369	Kim	I got nothing.
33370	J.D.	Appletinis.
33371	Jordan	So, you guys gonna keep it?
33372	Kim	Um, maybe...we well, if we do we can then we...maybe not.
33373	J.D.	Um, we don't prob well, there's a lot to con because we'll probably...maybe not.
33374	Jordan	You know, I had an abortion.
33375	Dr. Cox	All right, Jacky, as promised, let's go find ourselves a li'l stethoscope so you can hear what your butt sounds like.
33376	Jack	Daddy, what's an abortion?
33377	Jordan	Enjoy.
33378	Jack	My mommy had an abortion. My mommy had an abortion. My mommy had an abortion. My mommy had an abortion
33379	Dr. Cox	How you doin'?
33380	Jack	My mommy had an abortion...
33381	Elliot	Okay, Janitor, Carla's starting to push tell Turk.
33382	Janitor	Got it. Your baby has a tail.
33383	Turk	I told her to stay away from the microwave.
33384	Carla	Ahhh! Elliot, I can't do it!
33385	Elliot	Okay, okay. I want you to imagine that your uterus is like a tube of toothpaste, and you're just trying to squeeze out all that minty fresh gel. But instead of minty fresh gel inside, there's a little black baby.
33386	Dr. Matthews	We have a prolapsed umbilical cord. She needs a C-section right now.
33387	Carla	Put Turk on the phone, dammit!
33388	Elliot	It's okay!
33389	Carla	Baby! Listen. I'm not angry that you got stuck I know you were just trying to be nice, because you're a good-hearted, wonderful, thoughtful man. But listen to me: They're giving me a C-section, and I'm really scared. And I need you to be here right now!
33390	Janitor	Something about a C-section. Smile!
33391	Turk	Almost there.
33392	Janitor	Almost there.
33393	Turk	Baby! I'm here!
33394	Carla	Turk! I'm scared!
33395	Nurse	Sorry, Dr. Turk. No ice machines.
33396	Turk	Noo!

33398	Jordan	I was nineteen and working on Nantucket as a waitress, and dating this amazing guy named Andy...with curly blond hair and dimples and eyes that were either sky blue...powder blue I could never figure out which.... Anyway, his best friend, Curt, knocked me up.
33399	J.D.	Oh, we're not judging you.
33400	J.D.'s Thoughts	Whore!
33401	Jordan	I think about it from time to time, but it would have been the biggest mistake to have that baby.
33402	Kim	We've talked, we've made lists, and we've been as logical as we can here, and we've still got nothin'.
33403	Jordan	It's not a logical decision. If it's right, you'll feel it in your heart.
33404	J.D.	Yeah, but what if we don't feel anything?
33405	Jordan	Maybe that's your answer.
33406	J.D.	Carla's having a C-section.
33407	Dr. Cox	Jordan, you...you okay?
33408	Jack	My mommy had an abortion.
33409	Jordan	She sure did, sweetie. How are my boys?
33410	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
33411	J.D.	What's going on?
33412	Turk	They're about to start.
33413	Dr. Kelso	Turkleton! If you are trying to get the same five million dollar settlement that damn hook-handed security guard got, you're outta luck, stud. Because I put a little release button right here on top.
33414	Turk	Waaaaagggghhhh!
33415	Dr. Kelso	Well, what are you waiting for, son? Get in there.
33416	Turk	How you doin', beautiful?
33417	Carla	Turk, you're here...! I'm so hot....
33418	Turk	Oh, don't sweat it. I got ya.
33419	Carla	Aaaahhhhh....
33420	Elliot	Guys. I have an announcement.
33421	J.D.	Miguel, please!
33422	Elliot	The baby's out, but the cord was wrapped around its neck, so...we had to take it to the NICU.
33423	J.D.'s Narration	They say you never realize your capacity to love until you have a child. It can change who you are...
33424	Jack	Where do babies come from?
33425	Dr. Cox	"Where do babies come from?" Well.... When a mommy and a daddy love each other very, very much, sometimes they close their eyes...and they make a wish.
33426	J.D.'s Narration	...they can fill you with joy...
33427	Turk	Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce you to Isabella Turk.
33428	J.D.'s Narration	...it can even give your heart the answer you thought you'd never find.
33429	J.D.	Let's do this.
33430	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
33431	J.D.s Narration	It was a day of discovery. I discovered that I could sex my pregnant girlfriend into a coma.
33432	J.D.s Thoughts	Nice!
33433	J.D.s Narration	Carla discovered that her baby wasn't the only one who loved breast feeding.
33434	Carla	Ohhh, are you hungry, sweetie?
33435	Todd	I could eat.
33436	J.D.s Narration	Dr. Kelso discovered change was not always welcome.
33437	Dr. Cox	A coffee place in a hospital? What's next, Bob, an ice cream parlor in the morgue? Admittedly not a horrible idea, seeing as the freezers are already down there, plus it'll be a perfect place for kids one of our famous vanilla malteds definitely takes the sting out of having to identify the freshly charred remains of your father!
33438	Dr. Kelso	Nobody else seems to mind.
33439	Ted	I should'a worn sunblock.
33440	Darth Vader	Did you get tickets yet?
33441	Dr. Mickhead	Ah! Another one!
33442	Ted	Awwwww. Now I'm at the end of both lines.
33443	J.D.s Narration	Still, the best discovery was learning that someone I drummed out of medicine had landed on his feet.
33444	J.D.	Frontsies!
33445	Jason	Hey, Dr. D.
33446	J.D.	Mmm. That's what we call "Cabbage-tastic."
33447	Jason	Oh, I love this job I screw up, nobody gets hurt. Except Cindy.
33448	J.D.	Eww. How about a second of that dynamite ape impression.
33449	J.D.	I'm sorry, Cindy, once he's in monkey mode, you can't stop him. But who would want to, right? Cheers.
33450	J.D.	Hey, Kim! Just checkin' to see if your socks are back on, since I knocked 'em off last night! Helloooooo!
33451	Turk	And so is this: Way to hit that, player!
33452	J.D.	Right? Zoom
33453	Turk	Zoom
33454	J.D.	Zoooom!
33455	Turk	So sorry.
33456	Kim	Relax, it's just sex. We should be able to talk about it.
33457	Turk	I'm not telling Isabella she's got a vagina till she turns eighteen.
33458	Kim	That's gonna be an awkward birthday party.
33459	Turk	Do not tell my daughter she has a vagina! I'm serious! Hm!? Hm!? Hmm!?!
33460	J.D.	It may have already come up.
33461	Elliot	Kim, uh, J.D. tells us that you're looking around town for a new job?
33462	Kim	Yeah, I just don't think the department head here is ever gonna promote me.
33463	Elliot	Why?
33464	Kim	Dr. Lemke! You're gonna love this. We're a husband and wife piano playing team, only I have no hands!
33465	Kim	With my head!
33466	J.D.	How great is that!
33467	Dr. Lemke	This is my wife, Sally. She lost her thumbs last month when our pet Komodo dragon, Morty, got out of his cage.
33468	J.D.	On the bright side, you have beautiful nubs.
33469	Dr. Cox	A tip jar. Really? So what am I supposed to do, just duke you my change because you poured hot water through beans? Well, I'll tell you what, my friend, unless you're also planning on giving me a complimentary reach-around with my beverage, I'm afraid the answer is yeah...no! Here's a here's a novel idea: Why don't you go fetch me a very large cup of coffee with so damn many fake sugars in it, that the coffee itself gets cancer.
33470	Elliot	Guys, guys, I got a good one. Is it me, or does
33471	All	"...someone need to switch to decaf?"
33472	Turk	Lay off of Elliot. She doesn't watch as much old TV as we do.
33473	Elliot	You actually stood up for me! But, now I'm forced to ask
33474	All	"...who are you? And what have you done with Turk?"
33475	Elliot	STOP FINISHING MY AWESOME JOKES!
33476	J.D.	Oh, my God!
33477	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
33478	Ted	She's so beautiful. Can I hold her?
33479	Carla	That's up to Turk. He's kinda paranoid about people dropping her.
33480	Turk	Yeah, you got decent hands. Go ahead.
33481	J.D.	I get her first because we're best friends. Elliot. Ted, give it!
33482	Elliot	Ooh, I'm next.
33483	Turk	You drop everything.
33484	Elliot	When do I Besides now. Look, come on, it is a human life I'll focus. Give it to me! Right here!
33485	J.D.	So, Carla, how much time do you think you'll take off?
33486	Carla	Ohhh, look at this little angel. I may never go back to work.
33487	‘‘Todd	I heard suckling.
33488	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
33489	Elliot	So, you're having chest pains, Mr. Turner.
33490	Dr. Turner	Actually, it's Dr. Turner.
33491	Elliot	You look like someone I used to date. I had a brief older guy jones, but now I'm with someone more age-appropriate and I'm like, Eww, what was I thinking?
33492	Dr. Turner	Mm. We are disgusting.
33493	Elliot	Yeah, but for some reason I was curious. Anyhoo, uh, we'll just run the usual tests.
33494	Dr. Turner	Sounds good.
33495	Elliot	Dr. Turner seems like a nice guy. And he's hot you know, like if...you left Brad Pitt out in the sun forever.... Stop it, Elliot! It took you months to get over that old man fetish!
33496	Dr. Cox	Blondie! He is private practice. Those guys are cocky jackasses who don't give two shakes about anybody else's opinion but their own. They're...they're me, with one addendum: They're whores. And I'm not talking about the good kind of whores like my ex-wife. They're whores for money.
33497	Elliot	Is that a tip jar?
33498	Dr. Cox	Look...I'm figurin' if those lumps down at the coffee shop can have one, I can, too. Listen to me. You may like Turner right now, but he is a doctor, and doctors make terrible patients sooner or later, they all try to treat themselves.
33499	Dr. Kelso	Perry, a quick word
33500	Dr. Cox	Bobbo! No time! Gotta go tell Mr. Clancy that his tumor is benign. Is that not exciting? Should be worth a finski whatta ya think?
33501	Dr. Kelso	Where the hell did you all come from?
33502	Janitor	Sneak attack. You can put your shoes on again, guys. Nice work.
33503	Dr. Kelso	I do not want to hear any more about a college scholarship fund. Stop filling your children's heads with nonsense! Pull them out of high school and teach them a trade like plumbing or undertaking!
33504	Janitor	None of us here even have kids, except for Margo, and she sold hers.
33505	Dr. Kelso	Dental is for old people. You young bucks have years before you have to worry about your choppers.
33506	Janitor	One, two... Ahhh!
33507	Dr. Kelso	Lovely. No.
33508	Janitor	Aw.
33509	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
33510	J.D.	Man, we got smoked. That's what we get for playing a bunch of Gs from the 'hood.
33511	Turk	Those guys are Indian.
33512	J.D.	So "Rajesh" isn't one of those cool black homely names like "Anforny"?
33513	Turk	No, "Rajesh" is like "Steve" in India.
33514	J.D.	Ohh!
33515	Turk	Yeah.
33516	J.D.	You always buy me a cotton candy after the game to celebrate my good sportsmanship.
33517	Turk	Yeah, well, you know what? I can't be buying you stuff all the time!
33518	J.D.	Yeah, well, I'm very close to a tantrum.
33519	Vijay	Could you guys look at my shoulder? I tweaked it pretty good.
33520	J.D.	Come on, Vijay, first you dunk on me and yell, "Who's your bitch!" now you want free medical advice?
33521	Vijay	I'll give you twenty bucks.
33522	J.D.	I'm sorry, my friend, but that's just not ethical.
33523	Turk	Done and done!
33524	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
33525	Elliot	Uh, heh, who's the new guy?
33526	Dr. Turner	Oh, this is Dr. Kershnar from my practice. Elliot Reid, I was telling you about. Give her a wave. Atta boy.
33527	Elliot	Look, as a doctor, I know that you're gonna be tempted to wanna treat yourself, and I just want you to know that's not gonna fly with me.
33528	Dr. Turner	Understood.
33529	Elliot	Great. Now, I believe that surgery on your abdominal aortic aneurysm's gonna be too aggressive I'd like to start you on twenty-five grams of Lopressor.
33530	Dr. Turner	Don't you mean twenty-five milligrams?
33531	Elliot	There! See? You're already trying to treat yourself! That was a test.
33532	Dr. Turner	But twenty-five grams would kill me.
33533	Elliot	I know. But i-i-it's still a test.
33534	Dr. Turner	Fine. From now on, you're the doctor.
33535	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
33536	Vijay	Ahh!
33537	Turk	All right, relax, you're fine. Just ice it when you get home.
33538	J.D.	Put that away, Turk! That's back-alley money!
33539	Turk	Relax!
33540	Cotton Candy Vendor	Hey. I'll give you twenty bucks if you check out my rash.
33541	J.D.	I'm sorry, cotton candy man, but unlike my friend, here, I have no interest in being sued for Do I smell blue?
33542	Cotton Candy Vendor	Just added the dye.
33543	J.D.	Ohhhhh! You crafty, crafty man that is fluffing up nicely. Hey, give me some money, I'm jonesing for some c-squared.
33544	Turk	Oh, you don't want my back-alley money, do you?
33545	J.D.	You heartless bastard. All right, let's see your disgusting rash.
33546	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
33547	Dr. Kelso	I'd like to see the blueberry again.
33548	Jason	I've a non-fat latte with room for Schnapps for Janitor?
33549	Janitor	Yep, thank you.
33550	Jason	Yeah.
33551	Janitor	You're not worried about, uh, spider monkeys?
33552	Jason	Spider monkeys?
33553	Janitor	Spider monkeys see intricate metal work as a display of dominance. It's a threat to them they'd tear your eyes out.
33554	Jason	Well, I'm just psyched this place is paying for 'em.
33555	Janitor	You get dental?
33556	Jason	Mm-hmm.
33557	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
33558	Elliot	Hmm...so, uh, Dr. Turner said that I am a very talented young physician.
33559	Dr. Cox	Jordan said I'm the only man she ever wants to have sex with!
33560	Elliot	Oohhh.
33561	Dr. Cox	Aren't we sharing fantastic lies we choose to believe for personal reasons?
33562	Elliot	He's actually a very deferential patient. Instead of surgery, I'm treating his AAA with drugs.
33563	Dr. Cox	D'oh! Thank you! Dr. Chatterbox there scheduled him for...surgery.
33564	Elliot	What the hell, Kersh!
33565	J.D.	I don't care if we had extra coffee money left over I don't feel right taking that guy's cash.
33566	Turk	Dude, stop stressing. See you later.
33567	Dr. Kelso	Is anybody planning on emptying that?
33568	J.D.s Thoughts	Sometimes everything you need to know is on the side of a coffee cup.
33569	Janitor	Greetings, customer! What can I get you?
33570	J.D.s Thoughts	"...they may deceive you..."
33571	Dr. Cox	And here we are. Even though Kershnar's signature is on the chart, this is the gentleman who ordered the surgery.
33572	Elliot	No, he didn't. Tell him.
33573	Dr. Turner	What would you like me to say?
33574	Dr. Cox	I'm just gonna go ahead and tip myself for calling this one! Thank you, me!
33575	J.D.s Thoughts	"In the end, those same people will make you wish you'd never met them."
33576	J.D.s Thoughts	Maybe that wasn't just a rash on cotton candy man.
33577	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
33578	J.D.s Narration	I didn't tell Kim about how I most likely ruined my career by misdiagnosing the cotton candy man. I don't like to be a burden to the people I care about.
33579	J.D.	Turk. I need you, and I need you now.
33580	Carla	Isabella, this is the man you'll be competing with for your father's love.
33581	J.D.	Goochie-goochie-goo. Turk. Now.
33582	Turk	Babe, he's using his emergency tone.
33583	Carla	Go ahead. I have to feed her anyway.
33584	‘‘Todd	Formula's bad for the baby. Boob milk's healthier!
33585	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
33586	J.D.	His rash is probably purpura from disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, and I missed it, Turk. I'm screwed!
33587	Turk	He's gone.
33588	J.D.	Ohhh. I hope it wasn't the corn-dog guy. They never got along.
33589	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
33590	Elliot	Look, Dr. Turner, you're older, you're not in the best health I really think that this surgery could kill you.
33591	Dr. Turner	Are they gonna come in and shave me soon?
33592	Elliot	I'm still your primary physician.
33593	Dr. Turner	No, Kershnar's my lead now.
33594	Dr. Kershnar	I think surgery is the right choice.
33595	Elliot	Did you give him cue cards?
33596	Dr. Turner	That way he gets it exactly right.
33597	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
33598	Dr. Kelso	You don't scare me. Eventually, you will all come crawling back. Now, how about somebody gets me a banana-nut muffin, and hold the spit, please.
33599	Janitor	As manager, I reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.
33600	Dr. Kelso	Manager? You have worked here one day.
33601	Janitor	Corporate loved my ingenuity. I was saying, the two most addictive substances on earth are caffeine and... nicotine! Behold. Smokachino! For Kyle. Kyle! Smokachino for Kyle! Enjoy that.
33602	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
33603	J.D.	I feel like I dodged a bullet. Trust me, Brown Bear, you don't want this hanging over your head. Find Vijay and give him his twenty bucks back.
33604	Turk	Yeah, but then I'd have to give the money back to all the others.
33605	J.D.	Are you crazy? You could get sued! Secondly, I can't believe you went to the mall without me I specifically told you I needed to buy loafers.
33606	Turk	Well, I don't see you giving the money back to cotton candy man!
33607	J.D.	As a matter of fact, I already did.
33608	Doug	A twenty! Score!
33609	Turk	All right, I earned that money, and I'm not giving it back, and there's nothing you can do to make me.
33610	Carla	Give those people their money back!
33611	Turk	I can't believe you told!
33612	J.D.	Turk, we're doctors. We live by a moral code.
33613	Doug	Aloha! I came to see the little kahuna!
33614	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
33615	Dr. Cox	Giant coffee.
33616	Janitor	Saw you coming. Here's your vente drip.
33617	Dr. Cox	You know what I'll take one of those.
33618	Janitor	It's a sale.
33619	Elliot	You know the worst thing about Turner's surgery? I'm gonna be right, but...he's gonna die. It'll be a hollow victory.
33620	Dr. Cox	If I got to be right and have a private practice doctor die due to his own idiocy, I would call that a pretty full victory.
33621	Dr. Kelso	Banana-nut muffin, please.
33622	Jason	Sir, I've been told not to serve you.
33623	Muffin	Hey, just take me. What are they gonna do, put you in jail? You're Bob Kelso! Just grab me and run! Do it!
33624	Janitor	"Yaaay!" All right, I'm going on break. Don't touch the muffin puppet.
33625	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
33626	J.D.	Let's see if you're qualified to hold your own baby.
33627	Elliot	I caught it! That counts!
33628	Turk	J.D., what the hell! I'm a surgeon that coulda hit my hand!
33629	J.D.	Why are you being so weird lately? You won't loan me money for cotton candy, you're charging strangers for medical advice, and now you're worried about your hand? Who are you?
33630	All	"...and what did you do with Turk?"
33631	J.D.	Great work, everybody! Thank you!
33632	Turk	You saw what happened yesterday.
33633	Carla	Ohhh, look at this little angel. I may never go back to work.
33634	Turk	How the hell am I supposed to take care of a whole family by myself?
33635	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
33636	Dr. Cox	I'm so sorry, Barbie.
33637	Elliot	Why didn't he listen?
33638	Dr. Turner	Haaaaaahhhhhh!
33639	Elliot	Aaaaagggghhhh! OH!
33640	Elliot	I thought that you hated him.
33641	Dr. Cox	Ah, when it comes to torturing you, everybody's on the same page.
33642	Dr. Turner	You know, Reid, you had the cojones to stand up to me, unlike Kershnar, whom I've so demoralized he's basically my trained chimp.
33643	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
33644	Dr. Cox	Easy, buddy. That smell burning your nostrils isn't just the baby throw-up on her jacket
33645	Elliot	Oh, uh, I got to hold Isabella. She squirted out of my arms, but Carla caught her.
33646	Dr. Cox	it's the smell of a doctor with integrity.
33647	Dr. Turner	Also, you'll never have to answer to this guy again.
33648	Turk	Wow, I got a family.
33649	J.D.	I know. In seven months, I'm gonna have a family, too.
33650	Turk	J.D., for the last time, nothing happened.
33651	J.D.	Please, this isn't about that. It's just that I looked all over, I never found any balloons. You'd think there'd be some balloons.
33652	Turk	I look at Isabella, and I get really scared. And I'm gonna need you to be there to help me through this.
33653	J.D.	Well that sucks, 'cause I was counting on you to make it look easy so I know I can handle it when my turn comes.
33654	Turk	Awesome.
33655	J.D.	Turk, you're at the beginning of your career. You know you're gonna make plenty of money.
33656	Turk	It's good to hear that from you, thank you.
33657	J.D.	You're gonna be just fine.
33658	Turk	I suppose so.
33659	J.D.	...Totally fine.
33660	Turk	Yeah.
33661	J.D.	Would you mind telling me that I'm gonna be fine, Turk? Am I gonna be fine? I think I'm gonna be fine!
33662	Turk	Well, I would, but I don't know how much you like Kim.
33663	J.D.	I really like her.
33664	Turk	Then you're gonna be fine.
33665	J.D.	Thanks.
33666	J.D.s Narration	Opportunities are everywhere...
33667	J.D.s Narration	...Whether it's accepting an old job...
33668	Dr. Kelso	Hey.
33669	Dr. Kelso	Now clean up this mess.
33670	J.D.s Narration	...or taking a new job.
33671	Elliot	I'd...like to join your practice.
33672	J.D.s Narration	As for me, I was just excited to have the opportunity to get to know the mother of my child better.
33673	Kim	I got offered a new job.
33674	J.D.	Cool! Is it over at County? 'Cause that way I can drop you off every morning.
33675	Kim	It's in Tacoma, Washington.
33676	J.D.	Oh. That's gonna be a little rough on my scooter.
33677	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
33678	J.D.'s narration	To make more cash, sacred heart had started catering to rich folk, hence the swanky new suites.
33679	J.D.	Oh, not now.
33680	J.D.	Never. He's in a coma.
33681	J.D.'s narration	Not only were the new suites super expensive, they were absolutely ruing my figure.
33682	J.D.'s narration	Turk and Carla had just brought their new baby home.
33683	Turk	What's up, isabella? For your 16th birthday, your dad has made you a videotape. Now, I know future me is probably really strict, so no dating, no make-up, and no spending spring break with your friends on Mars. Last thing i need to worry about is my daughter getting eaten by a giant space slug. Know what I'm sayin'? Anyway, for your 16th birthday, my gift to you is to show you how happy your mom was the day we brought you home.
33684	Carla	Baby? I can't do this. We have to take her back.
33685	Turk	Happy birthday, sweetheart. We'll talk later.
33686	J.D.'s narration	As for me, my pregnant girlfriend just moved away, but I was still keeping things spicy.
33687	J.D.	Oh, of course I miss you, baby! Want to see a picture of me missing you? Hold on. Oh, thanks. Do you want to see a picture of my rock-hard abs? Ok, hold on. No, no, I've always had an innie. She wants to see a picture of my ass.
33688	Keith	Oh, J.D., I don't want -
33689	J.D.	I am your superior! what the ?
33690	J.D.	Oh, hey, Elliot, I'll have him back to you in one second.
33691	Elliot	Kim, yeah, those pictures are of keith, OK? Read 'em and weep. Look, J.
33692	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
33693	Keith	Come on, this is nothing like that.
33694	Elliot	What the hell are you doing? Oh, hey, Elliot.
33695	J.D.	Actually, keith, it's a little like that.
33696	Elliot	Little bit.
33697	J.D.	One areola shot, real quick.
33698	J.D.'s narration	Now that Elliot was private practice, there were tons of perks. For one, Dr. Kelso still refused to speak to her.
33699	Elliot	Hey, Dr. Kelso. Oh, if you're a doody face, don't say anything.
33700	J.D.'s narration	Still, the biggest perk is that at 5:00, she gets to dump her patients on someone else and go home.
33701	Elliot	Mr.
33702	Cox	You're giving orders to me? OMG, barboo, you make me want to LOL. I just discovered text messaging. I know i'm a little late to the game, but that doesn't mean that you're any less of a G.
33703	Elliot	Well, i'm just a little bit late for my brow wax and my facial, so I'm just gonna stick these orders to your lab coat so you don't forget them. Enjoy doing my bidding, while a team of burly old Russian women make me beautiful.
33704	Cox	Fine, I don't want to go home, anyway.
33705	J.D.	He said in a sarcastic tone we've all come to know as "Coxsian."
33706	Cox	I mean it. I don't want to go home.
33707	Cox	Honey, I brought you some dinner.
33708	Jordan	Come here, little goaty goaty!
33709	Jordan	I wasn't finished!
33710	Cox	You're finished.
33711	Turk	Honey, post partum depression's really serious.
33712	Carla	True, but there are different levels. Yes, some women leave their babies in the woods, but some women just get the weepies.
33713	Turk	And it's just the weepies?
33714	Carla	Just the weepies baby.
33715	Kid	Hi! Since you're African-American, I was wondering if I can borrow some of your marvin gaye cds?
33716	Turk	Sure. Come on in, kid. Here you go.
33717	Kid	Thanks! Mazel tov on the baby.
33718	Carla	How did he know I had a baby? Oh, great! I milked through my last clean t-shirt!
33719	Turk	Baby, we should really get some help.
33720	Carla	No! I've been a nurse for 15 years! What are they gonna tell us that we don't already know? Now, now, who are we?
33721	Turk	We're the Turks.
33722	Carla	And can the turks can get through this?
33723	Turk	Woman, the turks can handle anything.
33724	J.D.'s narration	To me, the best thing about Elliot is all her extra cash.
33725	Elliot	Hey, roomie! I went shopping. Oh, this couch reminded me of my grandpa. He used to drive around in a car just like it. You know, until he was killed in that 7-car pile-up.
33726	J.D.	"7- car pile-up" would be a good name for a rock band.
33727	Elliot	Yeah, you actually told me that on the day that he died. Anywho, I was thinking maybe we should put in some new hardwood floors.
33728	J.D.	Why stop at hardwood?
33729	Elliot	Yay, the new floors are in!
33730	J.D.	Careful. Trampoline floors take some gettin' used to. But I love 'em.
33731	J.D.	I like bouncing, but it is dangerous.
33732	Cox	I don't care if you don't like green. Jello is jello. Laverne, if I accidentally backed my car over Barbie, for sticking me with the world most annoying patient, what do you think your boy jesus would do?
33733	Laverne	Your wife is on the phone.
33734	Cox	He is not a merciful god, is he? Just tell her I'm still working, I have no idea what time I'm going to get off, And just go ahead and eat the entire mattress. I mean, for the love of God! I spend the entire day with patients and the entire night with her. I need a hide-out.
33735	Janitor	You're telling me.
33736	Laverne	Can you tell Dr.
33737	Cox	My god, this is beautiful.
33738	Kelso	Gentlemen, how is Mr. Worthington doing?
33739	Cox	He, uh, he's in a coma, bob.
33740	Kelso	Great! the man has the health insurance of a Tahitian prince.
33741	Cox	Well, I gotta tell you, this is heaven.
33742	Janitor	This gourmet trail mix is fantastic. I'm tastin' vanilla, cranberry, a hint of pine.
33743	Cox	That's potpourri, genius.
33744	Janitor	Is that hickory?
33745	J.D.	You should see all the sweet new toys elliot bought.
33746	J.D.	So, how are things at the homestead?
33747	Turk	Ah, no worries.
33748	Carla	I can't feed my own baby!
33749	Turk	See, baby, the great thing about working at a hospital is that we have access to all types of medical care. Having trouble feeding your baby? Bam, say hello to your lactation specialists.
33750	Todd	I can't see the nipple.
33751	Turk	Todd, get the hell out of here.
33752	Janitor	It's freezing in here.
33753	Cox	Put on a pair of pants, you'd be fine.
33754	Janitor	Hey, in my house, it's no pants, no problem. I'm putting in a videotape.
33755	Cox	Now, what the hell is this?
33756	Janitor	It's a security camera tape. I like to count the times that Colonel Doctor goes to the bathroom during the day, then freak him out by guessing the exact number. And there's one - Hey!
33757	Cox	Look, this this clearly isn't working out.
33758	Janitor	Well, I found this room, so you should go.
33759	Elliot	I specifically told you not to give Mr.
33760	Cox	Well, there were 2 treatment options, and when in doubt, I always go in the opposite direction of you.
33761	Elliot	Don't do it again.
33762	Cox	So, do it again? Look, barbie, What you're missing here is that you're private practice now. That means you're the enemy. And I know, as a doctor, disease is supposed to be the enemy, but I'm giving hepatitis and his bantam infectious buddies a pass, and I'm coming after you today. The bottom line is you'd rather clock out of here early than run the extra mile for your patients, and, barbie, that makes you a sell-out.
33763	Janitor	Ah, you went 14 times total 4 false alarms and one emergency.
33764	Janitor	I'm exhausted. Pick me up a latte.
33765	Turk	We're the turks, remember? Now, if you ask me, Isabella is placing calls, but no one's responding in the areola code.
33766	Carla	What?
33767	Turk	Those 2 little turkey timers you got there are telling me that that birdie's not done.
33768	Carla	What?!
33769	Turk	Ding, ding! Turkey's done.
33770	Carla	She's latching.
33771	Elliot	Dr.

33774	Elliot	I mean, seriously, since when does working at a hospital suddenly make you a better person? It's such a load of crap.

33789	Elliot	Oh, please, J.
33790	J.D.	I do not! OK, resist smelling that coconut goodness that caresses your tresses! Don't do it! Whatever.
33791	Carla	I think these would go great with that shirt.
33792	Turk	Why were you just helping that guy? These pants and the shirt are the only things I have left that fit me, and everyone keeps mistaking me for an employee. Anyway, I was helping Phil with his whole new denim look.
33793	Phil	Hey, could you also get me
33794	Turk	Go away, Phil. Baby, let's go see the doctor.
33795	Carla	No, I'm not gonna have people laugh at me because I can't care for my own child.
33796	Keith	Put that down. Elliot said that until you admit you're jealous, You can't use any of her things.
33797	J.D.	Well, Elliot's not here, keith.
33798	Keith	Do not turn on that tv.
33799	Elliot	He wrestled you, didn't he? See, Keith got his old high school uniform so that he actually incorporated it into our love play. I'm the lesbian coach and he's the captain of the wrestling team, and he turns me. So, have you decided to admit that you're jealous?
33800	J.D.	No, never, ok? And thanks a lot, because the one hour that Kim and I had to actually talk, I was stuckin your stupid boyfriend's scissor-hold.
33801	Elliot	Oh, don't you just love the way his thighs feel against your ears?
33802	J.D.	No, not particularly.
33803	Turk	Dr. Cox, I need your help. Not now, Gandhi. Darn it all, I I could have sworn there was a room right here Do you hear something?
33804	Turk	Look, Carla's going all postpartum depression-y on me, And she won't let me to take her to see a doctor.
33805	Cox	She's never gonna listen to you. You're a guy. You have no idea what she's going through. The fact is, the only person she will listen to is someone who's gone through it themselves.
33806	Turk	Fine. Who?
33807	Cox	I cannot believe I am doing this.
33808	Turk	I'm scared.
33809	Cox	Me, too, Gandhi.
33810	Jordan	What!?
33811	Cox	You look pretty, dear.
33812	Turk	So pretty. Keikers? Nuts.
33813	Elliot	Hi, J. D. Relax, I'm at the hospital.
33814	J.D.	What's the matter? Your aryan boyfriend had to go to a rally, so now you have to watch me?
33815	Elliot	Look, you don't have to admit that you're jealous. I was thinking, Kim's not around, and I can't even imagine how much that sucks, so, I sent her a webcam just like this one, and you guys can video chat whenever you want. Anything to make the long distance easier, right? Anyway, I hope you like it. See you.
33816	Kelso	I love the interhighway.
33817	Janitor	I've been expecting you.
33818	Cox	You know, jumpsuit, As I was scaling the hospital, I had an epiphany. This back-and-forth between you and I is just gonna get worse and worse. I mean, the only thing I could think about was retaliation, And I'm relatively certain that you've got a couple of tricks up your sleeve, too.
33819	Janitor	I do have a friend. He works on wall street. He and I got a good look at your personal finances, and he agreed to fly into town and bash your head in.
33820	Cox	Right. That would roughly be what I'm referring to.
33821	Janitor	Ahh.
33822	Janitor	We each ingest a cyanide capsule. On 3 One, 2, 3.
33823	Cox	No.
33824	Janitor	Sure?
33825	Cox	Get out of here. Look, there really is only one way to end this so that we both come out alive. We've got to page him.
33826	Kelso	You. Get the hell out of here before I charge you for every cashew you've pilfred from the mini-bar.
33827	Jordan	So you have post-partum depression.
33828	Carla	No.
33829	Turk	No, baby,you've got post - You have no lines in this play.
33830	Carla	Jordan, I can handle it.
33831	Carla	A job application for the gap.
33832	Jordan	Oh, that's a good career move.
33833	Carla	Look All I ever wanted was to be a mother, And now that I am one, I feel like I'm not cut out for it.
33834	Jordan	And you're ashamed of that? Well, wouldn't you be?
33835	Jordan	Yeah.
33836	Carla	I don't know.
33837	Jordan	When jack wouldn't stop crying, I wanted to throw that bastard out the window.
33838	Carla	Really? I wanted to throw Isabella out the window. Yeah, but we just had our apartment repainted, and all the windows were sealed shut, so I just wanted to drop her off the roof.
33839	Turk	Oh, my god!
33840	Jordan	Listen, you can't get rid this by sheer force of will or positive thinking or taking advice from a big Hollywood movie star and the dead science fiction writer he worships. You need to get some help.
33841	Carla	OK.
33842	Turk	That's what I've been try
33843	Jordan	If you talk again, I'm going to eat you.
33844	Elliot	Hey, everybody.

33847	Now, if we could just get cancer to go home at 5	0, we'd be all set.
33848	J.D.	Come on.
33849	J.D.'s narration	The first step of solving any problem is admitting that you have one. After that, you can start to work on feeling like your old self again.
33850	Tux	All right, Izzie. This is what your mom looks like on anti-depressants.
33851	Carla	Oh, we're sharing secrets now?
33852	Turk	Yeah.
33853	Carla	Oh, 'cause Izzie, look, this is what your daddy looks like the last time he tried to grow out his hair. How sad.
33854	Turk	That's cold, baby.
33855	Elliot	Hey, hey, hey, hey! That is so not why I bought you that.
33856	Kim	Elliot, relax. We heard you coming.

33862	JD's Narration	After 6 weeks home with her baby, Carla was facing the decision that all new moms have to face. Whether she should go back to work.
33863	Carla	Ok, so. If we take my salary and subtract the cost of a full-time nanny plus her health insurance, we will still end up with... losing $5 a month?!?!
33864	Turk	This is completely your decision. I'm ok one way or the other.
33865	Carla	Maybe I'll try staying home with Izzy for a year.
33866	Turk	Yes!!!!
33867	JD's Narration	As for me, ever since my pregnant girlfriend left, I've been a little clingy with my roommate.
33868	Elliot	JD, I'm going to get a drink from the water fountain. Do you wanna come?
33869	JD	Please, Elliot. I'm not that desperate.
33870	JD's Narration	Although I am a little parched. Plus I could hold back her hair.
33871	JD	The mind is a freaky thing, Elliot.
33872	Elliot	I haven't sung since the 6th grade talent show when I did Pat Benatar's "Hell Is For Children".

33880	Elliot	She's coming! This is not a drill, repeat.
33881	Turk	Remember, one group says "Welcome", one group says "back", one group says "Carla".
33882	Elliot	Fine, it was a drill.
33883	Carla	Hey everyone! Okay, let's have it.
33884	Turk	Dammit, people! - It's ok, baby.
33885	Carla	Hey, everyone.
33886	J.D.	I did.
33887	Turk	Done.
33888	Carla	Actually babe, I'm just heading back home.
33889	Turk	Ooh, pickle, I'm sorry.
33890	Kelso	What is all this fuss about nurse Turkleton returning? She's only been gone six days.
33891	Cox	She's been gone 6 weeks, Bobo. But wait, before I make you look like a complete idiot, we'd all like to thank you for setting up the new employee discount of copydump. Gang! - Cheers! - Pickle!
33892	Kelso	Stop, if it had taken any effort I wouldn't have done it.
33893	Cox	And back to insulting you, she's been gone 6 weeks, Bobo, the 6 days that you're referring to are the 6 days you actually worked this month.
33894	J.D.'s narration	Dr.
33895	Kelso	Thanks.
33896	J.D.'s narration	Or how he found a way to eliminate any facetime with the patients.
33897	Kelso	Welcome to Sacred Heart, Mr. Hartly.
33898	Ted	How does he always know?
33899	J.D.'s narration	He didn't even bothered to learn the new interns' names.
33900	Kelso	Listen up, faces.
33901	Debbie	Debbie is actually my name.
33902	Kelso	Then our reference is to the others, you will be Slagathor.
33903	J.D.'s narration	I always wondered what he did in his office all day.
33904	Kelso	Human Magic 8 Ball, tell me if I should play golf this weekend.
33905	Ted	I'm a lawyer!
33906	Kelso	I said, should I play golf?
33907	Ted	Ask again later. Why would I say that?
33908	J.D.'s narration	My daydreams are crazy.
33909	Ted	Ooohdizzy.
33910	J.D.'s narration	Since Elliot bought a house, I had to look for a place to live. Time to get out of my head and into an apartment.
33911	J.D.	Hey, Dr.
33912	Kelso	I actually don't mind that goofy bastard, if he were gay he would be perfect for my son. Harrison's been looking for a new power bottom. All my little worker bees, buzzing buzzbuzzbuzz I love making that sound.

33918	Kelso	That doesn't matter, son.
33919	Kelso	Private Dancer? Tough name.
33920	Brian	An I.
33921	Kelso	Iraq! You know how controversial that topic is, Bob, quick, change the subject.
33922	Elliot	Oh, please Laverne.
33923	Carla	So you think it's OK to just kill animals for sport?
33924	Janitor	If it serves or use for purpose, yes I do.
33925	Kelso	Well, I'll check on you later, son.
33926	Cox	Poor kid, said he's blown off, all for nothing.
33927	Laverne	All for nothing? My nephew Lance is over there fighting to give those people democracy.
33928	Cox	Ooh, so that's why we're over there.
33929	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
33930	Todd	Dude, I hear they have laws that make women completely cover their bodies, when around in public.
33931	Turk	Elliot, if you - Kill you!
33932	J.D.	You guys, in case I find an apartment I like I need someone to write a reference for me.
33933	Elliot	J.
33934	J.D.	Can you excuse me a second?! Did you bring her back in stubbing a newspapers?
33935	Turk	Carla is making me normally up when I go near things after the funnies.
33936	Elliot	Well, JD, the war? - I don't have time for this, Elliot.
33937	Janitor	Typical Dorian.
33938	Janitor	Really? Point to Iraq.
33939	J.D.	Why do you keep a globe on your janitor cart? Guess i get lost.
33940	J.D.	That's Iraq.
33941	Janitor	Some outrageous accusation.
33942	Brian	So, this is a picture of my unit after we secured the bridge outside ofof Fallujah.
33943	Kelso	Well, send it to her anyway. She should know what she's missing.
33944	Kelso	I like this kid.
33945	Kelso	Fantastic! And Johhny got a tattoo on the same cheek that says "Bobby".
33946	Kelso	No, you just can't find that kind of bond in civilian life. Although I've often wondered what my life would be like if I'd stayed in the Service.
33947	Kelso	I would have asked to be stationed in South East Asia for the food.
33948	Laverne	You goin' crap wise all you lots.
33949	Cox	And when you say Lord you mean Halliburton, right?
33950	Elliot	Ok, who here thinks democracy is worth fighting for? - Me! - I do! - Yeah! - Oh yeah! Who here thinks we were manipulated by false claims of WMDs ? We're here! - We do! - Me!
33951	Elliot	Neat.
33952	Laverne	Ted, what do you think? - I think both sides have valid points.
33953	Cox	Why d'you take a stand, Swept Balls?
33954	Cox	Oh, you liberals survey and every american agrees with you, that's why Jonh Kerry and Al Gore both won in landslides.
33955	Turk	Oh, my God.
33956	Elliot	You know what? I don't need to be ashamed of this, anymore. Yes, I'm a Republican.
33957	Keith	Elliot! Me too.
33958	Keith	I hate that bitch.
33959	Kelso	Oh! Hot dog, 2.
33960	Kelso	What is it, Slugathor? - Uhm, Dr.
33961	Kelso	Sluggy, if you want to get people's attention you've got to be more aggressive or more attractive, pick one.
33962	Kelso	Good morning Private Dancer Son?! Get respiratory for a blood-gas and set up for a lumbar puncture!
33963	Laverne	He's stable.
33964	Kelso	Whose fault is this? * Turk, Elliot and Cox exculpating *
33965	Kelso	They need a leader Bob, give them one.
33966	Kelso	I SAID THAT'S ENOUGH!
33967	Cox	Just a second on the yelling there Bob. Do you think you can actually be an absentee chief of medicine and still matter? Let me see if I can make this real clear for you. If this hospital were a human body, you'd be the appendix because at one time you served some function, but it was so long ago, nobody is quite sure what that was anymore. Excuse us, we're gonna talk it out over here.
33968	Kelso	Well, you've got what you asked for, Bob. They don't need you. Hey, son.
33969	Brian	Well, even though no one ever comes every time I hit this nurse's button, I feel a little better.
33970	Kelso	That's morphine.
33971	Brian	That explains it.
33972	Kelso	That's how you get people around you to listen to you, Bob.
33973	J.D.	Hey, buddy, You've found an apartment yet? No, man, i feel like an idiot so I've been reading up on this whole Iraq war situation.
33974	Kelso	All right, listen up people.
33975	Cox	We are working.
33976	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
33977	Elliot	And I can help out Dr.
33978	Janitor	You know if you're really serious about helping out I can use a hand of my to-do list I need to clean the toilets? I'm just tired of staring at that.
33979	Kelso	So, nobody needs any help.
33980	Laverne	When is your wife coming back to work? I'm drowning here without the Head Nurse.
33981	Kelso	Ok, ladies, I posted your room assignments on the board and we'll pass out the new weekly schedules before your shifts are over.
33982	Laverne	What did you think it would be like?
33983	Cox	We're losing him.
33984	Cox	Way to go Bob, way to go! That a boy!
33985	Kelso	I'm sorry what was the question? Jumbo Latte for Dr.
33986	Cox	Would you like to see something else that's really neat? Check out to this quote written on your cup.
33987	Elliot	"I enjoy laughing at poor people" Elliot Reid - April 2006 When I said that, I was watching "Good Time"!
33988	Cox	That's gonna be on every Jumbo Cup for a month, courtesy of my anti-war peeps. Can I get a hell HEAH? HELL YEAH!! OH YEAH!!
33989	Elliot	Typical lame liberal tactic, taking something out of context in order to defame someone's integrity. Am I right my pro-war amigos? - YEAH!! - OH YEAH!!
33990	Janitor	Gods, there seems to be a lot of high volume over enthusiastic opinion sharing, going on today.
33991	Turk	OkI'veI've seen enough.
33992	Elliot	Uhm, consider that a little gift from Nurse Roberts' nephew, Corporal Roberts.
33993	Kelso	Ok, Janice I'm going to need you to make sure Mr.
33994	Cox	Oh, Nurse Kelso, ooh, purple is not your color. Listen, could you con out the housekeeping and maybe send up some fresh scrubs for me and psst, come here. Please put on a bra, you're distracting some of the other doctors.
33995	Kelso	Let him joke, you look spippy and you're doing great.
33996	Laverne	Girl, just humor him.
33997	Kelso	Private, I'm gonna let you hand on a little secret.
33998	Kelso	If only.
33999	Brian	"My bagingo's on fire" May 2004 What's a "Bagingo"?
34000	Kelso	Eventually, your page is gonna go unreturned your test isn't gonna get run as quickly as they should have been, and sounds like kids like yourself gonna pay the price. What bothers me about it, is that I know this is going on, but there's nothing I can do to change it.
34001	Brian	Why not?
34002	Kelso	Let's just say that 'round here I'm not as loved as your sergent was.
34003	Brian	We hated Sgt. Bourne.
34004	Kelso	Come again?
34005	Brian	Yeah, he demeaned us, overworked us. Still, maybe sometimes that's what being a good leader is uniting everybody by giving them someone to hate.
34006	Kelso	All right, listen up gang.
34007	Cox	You mind telling us why?
34008	Kelso	Why the hell not? That ought to do it.
34009	J.D.	Since I've spent this afternoon researching the war in Iraq, I couldn't wait to dive right into the spirit of debate.
34010	Cox	What a jackass! Come on, no one wants to debate Iraq with me?
34011	Janitor	I'll debate Iraq with you.
34012	J.D.	Prepare to be dazzled.
34013	Janitor	Ok, in my opinion we should be looking for Bin Laden in Pakistan.
34014	J.D.	You've that globe nearby?
34015	J.D.'s narration	In life it seems we all have a role to play. Some of us are meant to be loved, and some of us, unfortunately, are meant to be hated.
34016	Kelso	Good night minions, Slugathor.
34017	J.D.'s narration	For Dr. Kelso, he wouldn't have it any other way.
34018	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
34019	J.D. Narration	Not only that I had a long distance girlfriend who was pregnant, but I still haven't found an apartment. So I was living in my half-acre in a tent. A haunted tent.
34020	Buzz	Stop stealing our power.
34021	Donna	You are ruining our neighborhood!
34022	J.D.	Oh really, Donna, I'm ruining the neighborhood? At least I'm quiet; were you guys having sex last night or raping a baboon?
34023	Buzz	I wasn't home last night.
34024	J.D.	My bad...
34025	Donna	I'm gonna beat your ass!
34026	J.D.	Donna! Ahhh!!!
34027	Dr. Kelso	Check out that body! Bet you would like to give her a ride, huh?
34028	Ted	ooh... you bet ya!
34029	Dr. Kelso	Over here, perv. It's for my retirement, so Enid and I can see the country in luxury.
34030	Ted	So it's uhh, wheelchair accessable for her, sir?
34031	Kelso	Ted, I'm not retiring for at least three years. If she's still alive I'll deal with it then. Now, take the rest of the day off and get it washed and waxed.
34032	Ted	You smell like my mom...
34033	J.D.	Alright, Mr. Mariani, mazel tov; you are the proud owner of yet another kidney stone! Did you try laying off the red meat, buddy?
34034	Mr. Mariani	I'm trying, Doc, but it's hard.
34035	J.D.	Oh man, Kim is having her first ultrasound tommorow.
34036	Turk	Oh, there's nothing like that first ultrasound. Bring tissue.
34037	J.D.	Are you kidding me? I can't just up and leave, I got to find an apartment I live in a T.P.
34038	Dr Cox	Do-o-o-rian! you have been wrong about so many things, that, I'm not even gonna say something is wrong, anymore, instead I'm going to say - It's a 'Dorian' . And the fact that you are willing to skip seeing that child's heart-beat for the first time is just plain' 'Dorian'. I mean - Hell! Jordan is having her second ultrasound and I couldn't be more gay. I can't wait to find out the sex of that unborn tax break.
34039	Turk	Jordan doesn't let you know the sex until the baby is born.
34040	Dr. Cox	'Dorian' again! Ye I don't know if it's the hormones or if the baby is actually eating the bitch cells, but Jordan has softened; in fact last night she... she asked me to cuddle.
34041	J.D. Narration	Is cuddling bad now?
34042	Turk	Baby? I need permission to road trip with J.D. to Tacoma so he can see his ultrasound.
34043	Carla	Sure! I think not giving you permission to do this for your friend would be totally 'Dorian'.
34044	J.D's Narration	How has this spreading so quickly?
34045	Dr Cox	Ghandi! Did you tell Jordan what I've said about her wanting to cuddle? She doesn't like people to know that she actually cares for me.
34046	Turk	Relax, she's pregnant. What can she possibly do?
34047	Jack	Man check!
34048	Turk	Oh!
34049	Jordan	Good boy, Jack, good boy!
34050	Turk	He can't possibly make it my fault, right?
34051	J.D.	'Dorian'. Oh, damn it now I'm doing it. Careful, he's going fetus.
34052	J.D. Narration	The secret to a great road trip is to get as many people as possible to come along.
34053	J.D.	So you guys in?
34054	Elliot	Totally! The last road trip I went on was with my sorority sisters and we went to Tijuana, so it'll be nice to go with people who actually like me.
34055	Keith	Why are you always so hard on yourself? Your sorority sisters probably loved you.
34056	Elliot	Keith, they tried to sell me.
34057	J.D.	You know, Keith, if the buyer hadn't been an undercover federal, Elliot would be a slave somewhere. There wouldn't be any uncomftorable sexual tension between us, and you and I would probably be best friends.
34058	Keith	Ye?
34059	J.D.	Ye...
34060	Elliot	Keith!
34061	Keith	Oh, uhh... We still can't make it, we made plans to finally hang out with my grandmom.
34062	Elliot	Oh Keith, the woman is 96 years old there will be plenty of weekends for that; Road trip!
34063	J.D.	This way.
34064	Elliot	O.K.
34065	Dr Cox	You know, you are one special lady, Carla. It's not every wife that works a full shift then goes home to change the baby's diapers while her husband and his girlfriend spend the weekend mooning truckers and playing slud bug.
34066	Carla	It's not a big deal.
34067	Dr Cox	Oh, but it is. If you keep let Ghandi do whatever he pleases whenever he pleases while you take care of the baby, eventually you won't even have time to shave your legs or gum your face, thats make the most promotive male figure in your daughter's life... you.
34068	Turk	Adios, pickle! As soon as I change out of this clothes - I'm outta here.
34069	Carla	I'm going, you're staying.
34070	Turk	How did you do that?
34071	Dr Cox	Ghandi, I'm great at this stuff. Don't ever talk to Jordan again.
34072	J.D.	Road trip! Where's chocolate bear?
34073	Carla	Getting to know his daughter.
34074	J.D. Narration	I knew that little tant baby will eventually ruin everything.
34075	Elliot	Keith, take the front sit, sweetie.
34076	Keith	Uhh, I can't.
34077	J.D.	Rowdy needs to see the world.
34078	Carla	We need a bigger ride.
34079	Ted	Do you guys know where I can find a giant car wash?
34080	J.D.	Oh! Alright!
34081	Ted	Woohoo! I got friends!
34082	Jordan	Hi cutie!
34083	Turk	Hi...
34084	Jordan	Oh like there's a chance I meant you.
34085	Turk	So you're here for the ultrasound, huh? I can't believe you gonna let him know the sex, especially when you could No, thats too mean, I couldn't do it.
34086	Jordan	No, mean is good. It's uhh, It's, uhh..... I like mean.
34087	Turk	You can learn the sex, not tell Perry, hold it over his head and play him like a little bitch boy.
34088	Jordan	Perry was so wrong about you! You're not an idiotic scalpel holding, basketball dribbling, blood sugar watching idiotic man boy.
34089	Turk	Stop...
34090	Keith	This thing is awesome!
34091	Elliot	What's with all these Kimonos?
34092	Carla	I don't know but there is a stripper pole in the back!
34093	J.D.	Carla got some serious moves! She can even do an inverted spread - legs pole spin. You know if thats how they called, It's not like I've take a pole dancing class or anything.
34094	J.D. Narration	Nice cover.
34095	Ted	Don't touch the kimonos, those are for Dr Kelso's various masseuses.
34096	J.D.	Ted, who's driving?
34097	Ted	Oh, my bad!
34098	Elliot	Maybe I should drive so we all won't die. No offense, Ted.
34099	Ted	None taken.
34100	Keith	I wish non of us had to drive...
34101	Computer	We are cruising at a comfortable speed, Dr. Dorian. We should arrive on schedule. Could you possible do me a small favor?
34102	J.D.	Of course, Jonathan 3000.
34103	Computer	Could you rub that spot off my dashboard?
34104	J.D.	You got it, pal.
34105	Computer	Oh yeah, just like that.
34106	J.D.	Alright.
34107	Computer	That's the stuff, you bitch!
34108	J.D.	It can get lonely on the road, even for computers. But this is gonna be great, right?
34109	Carla	I miss my baby. We have to go back.
34110	Doctor	Now, if we'll slide the wan over here, we'll see if it's a boy or a girl.
34111	Jordan	Wait! Change of plans, Per. Beat it.
34112	Dr Cox	No, no, no ; You committed to find out the sex of the child this time.
34113	Jordan	Oh yeah, I am gonna find out the sex, but you're not. Unless you'll work with Jack for the parent-child dance recital.
34114	Dr Cox	Jordan, the boy alredy lip sings into your tampons, must we put the final nail on his tiny gay coffin?
34115	Jordan	Momma wants a trophy.
34116	Dr Cox	Tell her she can't do this.
34117	Doctor	I would, but when she looks at me my inside gets all cold.
34118	Dr Cox	You're a coward! You're a coward!
34119	Turk	O-oh... Did Jordan change her mind for some strange unexpected reason?
34120	Dr Cox	Here, here, here, I'll help you.
34121	Turk	Thanks, that could be awesome.
34122	Dr Cox	Yo Beardface! Take your foot go ninety-ish. That a boy. Yeah!
34123	Turk	That was awesome. But uncool!
34124	Carla	He's not answering... Something is wrong with the baby I'm telling Elliot to turn around.
34125	J.D.	No, no, no, no, no. Carla darling, everything is fine with the baby, fine with the Hi what's that? Now I'll let you out when you calm down!
34126	Carla	Open this door J.D., let me out!
34127	Elliot	Now I realized that my dad had hugged me in my graduation. Not with his arms, you know, but, with his brain. Keith! Come and get me company, I'm lonely.
34128	Keith	Ye you know who else is lonely? My grandmom.
34129	Elliot	No, she's not, Keith. She is a lesbian in a nursing home full of ladies, you do the math.
34130	Keith	We can solve both of our problems if we can get my grandmother together with your mom.
34131	Ted	Excuse me, my mother sleeps with men, I've seen it!
34132	Keith	Alright, calm down, momma's boy.
34133	Ted	Bring it on, tall and sexy!
34134	Elliot	Kick his ass, Ted!
34135	J.D.	That's enough! If you guys can't get along just sit down and don't talk.
34136	Janitor	Amen to that.
34137	J.D.	Whar are you doing here?
34138	Janitor	I'll tell you what I wasn't doing here I was not taking a nap on company time on Dr Kelso's mobile home. Not this guy! Back to work.
34139	Ted	I don't think he knew we were moving...
34140	J.D.	Elliot, Stop!
34141	Jordan	So, can I stop squizzing out brats or is is another stupid boy?
34142	Doctor	Uh oh... Excuse me for a second.
34143	Jordan	Uh oh? Don't say Uh oh!
34144	Turk	I'm supposed to be in a road trip right now.
34145	Dr Cox	Well there's a little different between a road trip and an ultrasound!
34146	Turk	I'm supposed to be in a road trip right now!
34147	Jordan	Follow him! He said Uh oh.
34148	Elliot	O.K , let's get you up.
34149	Janitor	Where did everyone go?
34150	J.D.	He's fine, let's get going.
34151	Carla	Look at us. I hurt my ankle, Ted might have a broken arm and the Janitor is blind.
34152	Janitor	Hi, wait, no. coming back. Hello. Who is making pancakes?
34153	J.D.	See? He's great. And so is Ted.
34154	Ted	Ahhh! Oh... I think you popped it back in the joint.
34155	J.D.	You guys, Turk told me how amazing it was when he say Izzy's ultrasound, I can't miss this, I just, I won't.
34156	Janitor	Can I say something? I don't know this young man, I wish I did. I admire his spirit! And if he says we must continue on then I say I am in!
34157	J.D. Narration	There are a lot of times in life when you just got to take control.
34158	J.D.	Wait, give me those keys. I'm driving. Next stop Kim town.
34159	J.D Narration	Of course, sometimes, control is taking away from you.
34160	Dr Cox	You have to operate on my baby while it's still in the womb?
34161	Dr Matthews	Well there's a urinary tract obstruction that could be blocking the amniotic fluid. We need to cause a shunt.
34162	Dr Cox	I got to talk to Jordan.
34163	Turk	Mickhead! Give me my phone.
34164	Mickhead	It's mine.
34165	Turk	Oh really? Does yours have a picture of Carla in the background?
34166	Mickhead	Yes.
34167	Turk	Huh! Trick question mine got Tyra Banks, see?
34168	Carla	Baby? I got Turk!
34169	J.D Narration	And sometimes you're just not as in control as you think you are.
34170	Ted	Uhh, that tunnel looks kinda small.
34171	J.D.	Chill out, Ted.
34172	J.D. Narration	why would they build a tunnel that an R.V. won't fit ? I can admit that the tunnel was more narrow than I thought but the damage wasn't too bad. Keith just had to stop accidentily making the 'please honk your horn' sign to to passing truckers.
34173	Elliot	Frick on a stick!
34174	Keith	I was stretching!
34175	Ted	Four aces, I win!
34176	Janitor	Now you only got six clover, I win.
34177	Carla	O.K. baby, bye. There's a problem with Jordan's ultrasound.
34178	Dr Matthews	This is our best chance to restore normal function and minimize the damage to the lungs.
34179	Dr Cox	Fine but I want to be in there.
34180	Dr Matthews	You know we can't allow family members in the O.R.
34181	Dr Cox	You gotta be in there for me.
34182	Turk	Don't you see I got a baby strapped to my chest?
34183	Dr Cox	Now can you?
34184	Turk	First of all, I'm not a newborns surgeon. Second, you ruined my road trip. And you just gave my baby to Rochelle, the only nurse to get kicked out of the nursery for using babies as a ventriloquist dummy.
34185	Rochelle	I don't like being licked.
34186	Rochelle	Thats because you didn't find anyone who doing it right.
34187	Turk	Give me that. What's the matter with you?!
34188	Dr Cox	Ghandi! You'd damn sure want somebody in there if it was your kid.
34189	Rochelle	C'mon, just do it.
34190	Turk	Knock it off, Rochelle.
34191	J.D.	You guys, here's the hospital.
34192	Elliot	Keith, wake up sweety we're here.
34193	Keith	Yes! I didn't see a truck.
34194	Elliot	Well, how are you gonna get home?
34195	J.D.	I don't know, I'll rent a car or something. Go take care of Dr. Cox; tell him Gladys is thinking of him, he'll know it's me.
34196	Elliot	Good luck.
34197	Janitor	Very well, stranger. I shall toast you with my hardest wine.
34198	J.D.	Maybe he should lay down.
34199	Dr Kelso	Turkelton, if I let you assist on that on that surgery I would be breaking every hospital protocol, and you know damn well I would never be that inappropriate. Oh thanks, sugar boobs. Lucky for you, I am a man in need. Enid asked me to get her tickets to see Al Green for her birthday, I forgot. Now it sold out. Can you call him for me?
34200	Turk	Sir, do you think I know Al Green just because I'm black?
34201	Dr Kelso	Plan B. Also, lucky for you - Enid has gone blind from glaucoma, now - here's what I need.
34202	J.D. Narration	In life, it's never easy to know what's waiting for you on the other side of the door.
34203	J.D.	Surprise.
34204	Kim	Oh my God... J.D.!
34205	J.D.	Come here for a second, come here. Is this your office?
34206	Dr Cox	Everything is gonna be O.K.
34207	Jordan	I know.
34208	Dr Cox	Jordan, I love you.
34209	J.D. Narration	Sometimes you find a moment that knocks you on your ass.
34210	J.D.	How's our baby doing, huh?
34211	Kim	J.D., I had a miscarrige.
34212	J.D.	Other times, it just takes your breath away.
34213	Turk	Wow...
34214	Turk	Hi. So everything went great, ye. Jordan and the baby are fine.
34215	Dr Cox	Fair enough.
34216	Turk	That's it?
34217	Dr Cox	Yep.
34218	Turk	O.K. I don't know about you, but when I get great news I like to show some form of emotion. Like when I graduated med school I went all Billy 'white shoes' Johnson. And then when Izzy was born, Tiger Woods' arm swing.
34219	Dr Cox	Look, you know as well as I do that no kid who had surgery before it's even born not just gonna pop up in the world without any... without any problems. In three months, it's gonna outgrow that shunt and we're gonna have to get through it all over again so you're gonna have to excuse me if I'm... not celebrating.
34220	Turk	Your baby is gonna be fine.
34221	Dr Cox	And just how can you be so sure at that?
34222	Turk	Because that little thing grabbed my finger so tight, and wouldn't let go. Perry, she's strong.
34223	Perry	She?
34224	Turk	Yes, daddy.
34225	Kim	I should have told you earlier, I just didn't want to do it on the phone and... are you O.K.?
34226	J.D.	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I just... it's kinda weird, there was this thing that I never met and now it's gone and I kinda miss it.
34227	Kim	I know...
34228	J.D.	I was alredy kinda looking for doing all those parents things you hear about, you know like - change diapers, first steps, playing catch. Turk was gonna even teach me how to throw like a guy, so...
34229	Kim	Unless it was a girl, then you could just throw like yourself. Can I ask you something? Were we just staying together cuz' we were having a kid?
34230	J.D.	No... no, c'mon. Come back from this in a couple of months and we'll pick up whereever we left off. I mean, I guess it will be a little more casual, we should probably won't talk without either one of us wearing full body condoms.
34231	Kim	What if I... wasn't coming back because they offered me a permanent position here?
34232	J.D.	Did they?
34233	Kim	Yeah...
34234	J.D. Narration	We sat there all night and talked about everything. How we felt about each other, whether we can handle a long distance relationship, did she ever see herself come back to 'The Sacred Heart', will a pizza place deliver to a bench at three in the morning... they would... And on the end of it all, we realized that without a baby in the picture, the best thing to do is to say goodbye, stay friends and just hope that our paths cross again. Someday.
34235	J.D.	So then I took a $900 cab ride home, and voilà: here I am.
34236	Elliot	J.D., thats sucks. I'm so sorry.
34237	Mr. Mariani	Bummer. Now why am I back in here again?
34238	J.D.	Cos' I couldn't wait to rub a little jelly on your treasure trail. I need to see if your kidney stone dissolved yet. J... D... I always do that.
34239	Elliot	Do mine.
34240	J.D Narration	There are really only two kinds of surprises. The good ones, that makes everything O.K.
34241	Dr Cox	It's a girl... we're having a baby girl.
34242	J.D. Narration	And the bad ones, that makes you mad.
34243	Kelso	There's papa's pleasure palace. It looks great, Teddy.
34244	Ted	I'm going on vacation.
34245	Kelso	Theodore!
34246	J.D.	Alright, let's take a look.
34247	J.D. Narration	And I could never be mad at Kim for giving me a bad surprise.
34248	Doctor	Everything looks healthy. See? Here's your baby's heart beat.
34249	Kim	Wow...
34250	J.D. Narration	Because at least she was straight with me.
34251	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
34252	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
34253	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
34254	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
34255	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
34256	Open	In a park. A frisbee is thrown, landing near Dr. Kelso's feet.
34257	Man	Hey, grandpa, a little help.
34258	Dr. Kelso	Here you go, sport. But call me "grandpa" again, and you and I are gonna play a little game called "hide the wingtip". There may be a generational gap here, I'll explain. The wingtip is my shoe, the hiding place is your ass.
34259	Maggie	Hi, Bob. That's why I always save you a place. You keep the riff raff in check.
34260	Dr. Kelso	My pleasure. Well, let's see what Enid packed for lunch today. A stapler and a golf ball. She's not well.
34261	Maggie	Trade ya. My apple for your golf ball.
34262	Dr. Kelso	Done. Maggie, how long has your foot been like that?
34263	Dr. Kelso	Nurse Turkelton, I want you to take good care of my friend Maggie here. Don't worry, we'll take care of you.
34264	Carla	Name and insurance, please.
34265	Maggie	Maggie Kent, and none.
34266	Carla	All right, let's find her a room.
34267	J.D.'s narration	When a patient doesn't have insurance, you have to work around the system. First, you have to find someone who's recently died.
34268	J.D.	Cool, Mr. Rabinowitz just kicked it! Oh, don't worry, he put his peep in an electrical socket. You can't do that.
34269	J.D.'s narration	Then you have to convince the morgue guy to sit on the paperwork so the deceased's bed stays open.
34270	Doug	Deal.
34271	J.D.'s narration	Then you have to get the floor nurses to play along.
34272	Laverne	Enjoy your kosher meal, Mr. Rabinowitz.
34273	J.D.'s narration	Then you have to find a surgeon to do the work pro bono.
34274	The Todd	Dude, I've had a pro bono, like, all morning. Something-might-be-wrong five!
34275	Turk	I got this one.
34276	J.D.'s narration	But, most importantly, you can't let any higher-ups find out that a patient is uninsured, even if they're the ones who brought her here in the first place.
34277	Maggie	Bob, I want to thank you for doing all this, even though I don't have any...
34278	J.D.	Dr. Kelso, we need to talk to you.
34279	Dr. Kelso	What is it?
34280	J.D.	Uh, we want to go somewhere with you.
34281	Dr. Kelso	Okay. Where?
34282	J.D.	A spa. We'd like to get some massages.
34283	Dr. Kelso	Well, I know just the place.
34284	Turk	Great, now I've got a crick in my neck.
34285	Dr. Kelso	We're gonna get a little graphic here, so you fellas might want to look the other way, or not, it's your choice.
34286	J.D.	Turk, why are you looking?
34287	Turk	It's my neck crick. I can't move.
34288	Dr. Kelso	Watch this, Turkelton. She calls it the "Shanghai Surprise".
34289	Turk	Oh, God.
34290	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
34291	Open	Close-up of Turk's badge. Camera zooms out, showing Turk and J.D. talking to Maggie.
34292	Turk	Okay, Maggie, as soon as your labs come back, we'll prep you for surgery.
34293	Maggie	You two are my guardian angels.
34294	Dr. Kelso	Hey, good morning, fellas.
34295	J.D.	Sir, how are you? Lookin' good.
34296	Turk	What's happening with you?
34297	Dr. Kelso	Why so awkward? You never saw a colleague get a happy ending before?
34298	Turk	No, not that happy.
34299	J.D.	But thank you for including us.
34300	Dr. Cox	Oh, say, Barbie, wait just a second. I gotta tell you, you look... Well, darn it all, you look great today.
34301	Elliot	Thanks!
34302	Dr. Cox	Yeah.
34303	Elliot	I started using that new facial cream made from baby foreskins.
34304	Dr. Cox	Oh!
34305	Elliot	But I don't understand... You haven't complimented me in six years. Why today?
34306	Dr. Cox	Well, since you're a private practice doctor who went home yesterday at 5:00, leaving me up all night with your melanoma patient, I just knew if I complimented you, sure as shootin' you'd look at me just a hair too long, and then this would happen.
34307	Elliot	Oh, you think you're funny?
34308	Dr. Cox	I do. I always have, ever since I was little. It's one of the reasons that I'm a winner.
34309	Elliot	I'm in a hurry. I promised one of my patients that I would meet him for his first day of drug counselling. See? I wrote it right there.
34310	Dr. Cox	Oh, Barboo, gimme a break. Why in God's name do you think I'd care about anything that you wrote down?
34311	Elliot	You wouldn't.
34312	Elliot	Ha!
34313	Carla	Nice! Hey, can you believe who the new drug counseller is?
34314	Sam Thompson	I just want you all to know that I've been right where you are. Hell, a couple of years ago, I was in this very hospital, scamming that nice doctor over there for painkills. Can everyone say hi to Dr. Reid?
34315	Group	Hi, Dr. Reid.
34316	Elliot	Hey, drug addicts! What's up?
34317	Laverne	Girl, can you believe what they sell in these white people magazines? Look here. This is a computer chip that you can put in your baby's foot, so you can track it. Like a baby LoJack.
34318	Carla	Yeah, white people do that craziest things.
34319	Laverne	Like bumper stickers. I don't give a damn what you brake for.
34320	Janitor	I know. White people. No... No, my step-mom is one-quarter Inuit, so I'm part Eskimo. Anyway, small favor. I need your baby. I'm getting into the baby broker business. Nothing illicit, I'm just hooking up folks who can't have babies with folks that don't want babies.
34321	Carla	You, leave.
34322	Carla	You, give me that baby LoJack number.
34323	Laverne	Already tore it out.
34324	Turk	Hey.
34325	Carla	Babe, where were you? We were supposed to meet for breakfast.
34326	Turk	My bad, I was hanging out with J.D. and Rowdy, and we decided to pull a prank that we used to do back in the day.
34327	J.D.	Here comes Ted! Go, go, go, pull!
34328	Ted	I love you, I love you. Ghost dog!
34329	Dr. Kelso	Calm down, people. We have a back-up generator. Thank God. I was just bluffing.
34330	Turk	Won't be doing that again.
34331	Dr. Kelso	Ted, look at this budget! I've got half a notion to make you pay for every cent of that new transformer.
34332	Ted	I'm telling you, sir, a lifeless ghost dog glided in front of my car wearing roller skates.
34333	Dr. Kelso	If this is your way of trying to make me feel guilty about paving over that Indian burial ground, it isn't going to work. We needed the damn parking spaces! Now, why in the hell are we paying this much money for scrubs?
34334	Ted	Maybe people are stealing them.
34335	Dr. Kelso	Now, why would people be stealing scrubs?
34336	Ted	Hey, Mom. A guy tried to die on me today, but I didn't let him. I didn't let him.
34337	Choir	What a friend we have in Jesus.
34338	Doug	Excuse me, guys, stealing scrubs here.
34339	Sam	So, anyway, I've been an addict since I was 14. About a year ago, I realized it was time to wake up and get sober.
34340	Elliot	So, you finally just hit rock bottom.
34341	Sam	No, no, no. I hit a cop. But anyway, since I wasn't willing to do the things, you know, you need to do in jail to get narcotics, at least not enthusiastically, I... I got clean.
34342	Dr. Cox	I have a game. Raise your hand if you're full of crap. Sam, if you don't raise your hand, you're going to lose the game.
34343	Sam	Come on, man. You don't know how hard it's been to stay straight.
34344	The Todd	Been there, brother.
34345	Janitor	Arrrrrrr.
34346	Carla	Turk! You know I hate that damn dog!
34347	Janitor	No, it's not bald, black doctor. It's haired, half-white, half-Inuit Janitor, and this is the real Rowdy.
34348	Carla	Excuse me?
34349	Janitor	You recall a couple years ago, you lost him?
34350	Janitor	Woof-woof.
34351	Janitor's voice-over	You were panicked that your husband was gonna find out, so I sold my entire stuffed squirrel army in exchange for Stephen, an exact replica.
34352	Janitor	What you don't know is that I retraced your steps that day, and I found Rowdy. Now, I think if your husband knew that he'd been loving a fake dead dog all this time, he'd be very unhappy.
34353	Carla	You're a crazy person.
34354	Janitor	Am I? Or am I a brilliant mastermind who's waited two long years until he needed something from you? And now that day has come. Here's what I want. I want your baby. We already talked about that. I want you to tell that new borderline anorexic nurse to eat a sandwich and then to go salsa dancing with me. Also, I want you to teach me to salsa dance. I want a pound of frankincense, mostly just to see what it is. And, lastly, I'm in a little bit of a tiff with the main barista down at Coffee Bucks. He's not above poisoning me, so I'm gonna need you to be my official beverage taster. Yes?
34355	Carla	I'm just gonna confess everything to Turk.
34356	Janitor	Grrrrrrrr.
34357	Janitor	No, easy, boy, we'll get her.
34358	Elliot	Why can't you just give Sam a break?
34359	Dr. Cox	Look, the only thing Sam did was to go from being a lying drug addict, to being a lying drug addict who works here.
34360	Elliot	People change. I knew this one migrant worker from our orchard, Ramon. He used to say "I hate applesauce. It destroys the integrity of the la manzana." Manzana's Spanish for "apple". Anyway. Last time I was home, I asked how Ramon was doing. Vice President of Mott's Applesauce. It's true, Ramon Delgado, look him up on the Internet.
34361	Dr. Cox	I will.
34362	Elliot	Don't, I made it up. The point is, people can change and you know it.
34363	Dr. Cox	Nothing ever changes. The artist formerly known as Prince is still just Prince. My ex-wife is still pretty much my wife. Grey's Anatomy always wraps up every episode with some cheesy voiceover that ties together all of the storylines, which, incidentally, is my least favorite device on television. Newbie continually will try to violate my "no touching" policy. Uh-huh. And Republicans will forever try to raise...
34364	J.D.	Sneak hug!
34365	Dr. Cox	Of course, I would go kill him right now, but he actually just helped prove my point.
34366	Laverne	This is gonna help, too. There are 10 orders of Percocet missing from the pharmacy.
34367	Dr. Cox	Well, I think I have a pretty good idea who I'm gonna give my complimentary urine test to.
34368	Maggie	So, how bad is it going to be?
34369	Turk	Well, you're going to lose the dead tissue, but, thanks to modern medicine, you're gonna keep most of your foot. You wouldn't believe how much worse it would have been even a few years ago.
34370	Turk	This might hurteth a little.
34371	J.D.	Look, milady, I know it stinks that we're removing your foot and plan to eat it tonight at the Healing Feast, but you wouldn't believeth how much worse this would have been even a few years ago.
34372	Maggie	Unga unga bunga ungo.
34373	Turk	Unga.
34374	J.D.	Buga buga.
34375	Turk	Unga bunga.
34376	Maggie	Ooh? Hmm?
34377	Turk	Unga! Unga! Unga!
34378	J.D.'s narration	Unga bunga tonga runga, katonga patonga bonga.
34379	J.D.	I may have killed you, but I think I was upset about it.
34380	Dr. Kelso	Listen up, people! Gather round. Not you, Mr. Miler. Staff only. All right, this is going to be very simple. Whoever has been stealing scrubs is going to raise their hand, pay the hospital back and be immediately fired. Let's see 'em. Okay, you people leave me no choice.
34381	Dr. Kelso	There, now you all have to wear scrubs so hideous that no one would steal them. You brought this on yourself, you thieving bastards.
34382	Carla	Turk, I need to talk to you about Rowdy...
34383	Turk	Okay, wait. Before you say anything, sorry I skipped out on breakfast to good around with Rowdy, but you gotta understand, Rowdy is more than just a dead toy to J.D. and me. We got him together in college and he's always been there.
34384	Carla	The key to the salsa is passion.
34385	Janitor	And spin!
34386	Laverne	There were no drugs in Sam's bag and his urinalysis came back clean.
34387	Sam	Don't beat yourself up, big guy. I would have suspected me, too.
34388	Elliot	Maybe we should post the transcript for your "nothing ever changes" rant in the cancer ward for the chemo patients as a little pick-me-up. Oh, and FYI, I happen to like the voiceovers on Grey's Anatomy, except for when they're really vague and generic.
34389	J.D.'s narration	And so, in the end, I knew what Elliot said about the way things were has forever changed the way we all thought about them.
34390	NEW_SCENE	NEW_SCENE
34391	Open	Dr. Cox and Elliot walking down the halls of Sacred Heart.
34392	Elliot	I actually don't mind the new scrubs. It really makes my outfit pop.
34393	Elliot	Look, I know that you feel stupid for falsely accusing Sam, but it all goes away if you just apologize to him.
34394	Dr. Cox	Way ahead of you on that score, Barboo. I wanted to surprise the gentleman with something I thought he'd really enjoy, so I went out and got him a brick of heroin shaped like a heart. Now, if I could just find him a funny card.
34395	Elliot	If you really thought he was still a drug addict, you wouldn't let him counsel people.
34396	Dr. Cox	Of course I would. Addicts make the very best counsellors, because they know just exactly what druggies are going through, mainly because, and see if you can follow this, they're currently going thought it, too.
34397	Elliot	I don't care what you think. I'm always gonna believe in people.
34398	Dr. Cox	All the best with that Barbidiot.
34399	Dr. Kelso	You brought these caca-colored scrubs on yourselves, folks, and thanks for playing along with that hideous suit, Ted.
34400	Ted	Playing along with what, sir?
34401	Dr. Kelso	Nothing. Looking sharp. Wow.
34402	Carla	See? It's fine. Nobody's trying to poison...
34403	Janitor	I knew it! She's gone. Oh, boy, someone's gonna have to tell black doctor. I do not want that job.
34404	Janitor	Zombie!
34405	Carla	I can't do this anymore. I'm out.
34406	Janitor	What? Oh, no, no, toots. You're out when I say you're out. I saw that, Frank.
34407	Carla	Here's the deal. When nobody's looking, we grab Stephen and make him go bye-bye. Then there will only be one dog left. So, when Lurch suddenly shows up with the real Rowdy, Turk will have to assume that he's the one who stole him from the car. Got it?
34408	Laverne	Whatever. Let's do this. Laverne Roberts!
34409	Carla	Laverne, I got the keys right here.
34410	Dr. Kelso	Well, tuna fish on a sponge. She's getting closer.
34411	Maggie	Hey, Bob.
34412	Dr. Kelso	Hey, Maggie. I thought we were gonna take care of that foot.
34413	Maggie	I don't have insurance. It's okay, I can get by.
34414	J.D.'s narration	Everyone reacts differently to unpleasant discoveries. Some people get angry.
34415	Dr. Kelso	Save my seat.
34416	J.D.'s narration	Others are admittedly a tad more dramatic.
34417	J.D.	Oh, my God, he's gone. I think I'm gonna be sick.
34418	Turk	I never got the chance to tell him I loved him.
34419	Same	I mean, guys, I know all about bottoming out. All right? It wasn't long ago that I was out there , on my knees, praying to the gods for help.
34420	J.D.	God, please!
34421	Turk	Lord!
34422	J.D. and Turk	Please, God!
34423	Turk	Bring him back!
34424	J.D.	Why?
34425	Turk	Bring back our Rowdy!
34426	Sam	That was weird. Uh, okay, why don't we call it a day, okay? Okay, guys? Proud of you, proud of you, proud of you, proud of you .
34427	Same	Are you... are you seriously doing the clichéd sarcastic slow clap? Because that is way too 1980s.
34428	Dr. Cox	It was a hell of a performance. The attitude, the indignation. It was damn near believable, do you know that?
34429	Sam	Honestly, I don't really feel the need to convince you of anything, but I will say that if you're waiting to watch me slip, I think things are gonna get really frustrating for you.
34430	Lloyd	Let me tell you something, man. This guy is amazing, okay? He's unbelievable. To even get into his class, you have to bring any drugs you have at home so you're not tempted.
34431	Dr. Cox	Let's see if I've got this right. You have to give your drugs to him?
34432	Lloyd	Oh, absolutely, yeah. Oh, that reminds me. Uh, I found these in my dryer.
34433	Sam	Thank you, Lloyd. Thank you.
34434	Sam	He's doing very well.
34435	Dr. Cox	Even I have to admit, that was pretty darn clever.
34436	Sam	Thanks. I, uh... I came up with it when I was shooting up with my sponsor in the back of his El Camino. Crazy!
34437	Dr. Cox	I'm gonna go ahead and take this whole moment, I'm gonna find Dr. Barbie and I'm gonna rub it in her face.
34438	Janitor	Well, howdy, boys! 'Member me?
34439	Ted	Ghost dog! Ghost dog!
34440	Janitor	You forced my hand.
34441	Turk	Gimme that!
34442	J.D.	How dare you steal our dog?
34443	Janitor	Huh?
34444	Carla	Sorry, you lose, bye-bye. Oh, and you should still have someone check your coffee before you drink it.
34445	Janitor	Squid oil. That's one for you, Frank.
34446	Dr. Cox	Barbie, I have the most exciting news to tell you!
34447	Dr. Kelso	What the hell people? I saw Maggie Kent in the park. Why didn't we treat her?
34448	Carla	She has no insurance.
34449	Dr. Kelso	Well, why didn't we do what we always do? Why didn't you fix it while I turned my back and pretend not to notice? You know the dance.
34450	J.D.	We used to, but if you're gonna threaten to fire us over taking a pair of scrubs, why wouldn't we think you'd fire us for treating an uninsured patient?
34451	Turk	Yeah, when you took away the scrubs, you took away the trust, and without trust, everything falls apart.
34452	J.D.'s narration	And just like that, we got our old scrubs back.
34453	J.D.	I'm telling you guys, this could have been a much bigger moment.
34454	J.D.'s narration	Even though I was the only one who knew how to embrace life, we all left thinking about how important trust is.
34455	J.D.'s narration	Dr. Cox let Elliot keep her trust in humankind a while longer.
34456	Dr. Cox	I, uh... I just wanted to apologize to you, Sam, for not believing in you.
34457	Sam	Thanks.
34458	Sam	Well, why didn't you tell her?
34459	Dr. Cox	'Cause this hospital will eventually make her just as cynical as everybody else in the dump. She didn't need my help on that one. By the way, do me a favor. If you do use later, don't drive.
34460	Sam	I take the bus, dude.
34461	Dr. Cox	Yeah.
34462	J.D.'s narration	Carla protected the trust that we have in her by coming clean.
34463	Carla	Anyway, I should have told you guys I lost him back then, but, hopefully, this'll help you forgive me.
34464	Turk	Whoa!
34465	Turk	Look at them standing next to each other. Two beautiful dead dogs.
34466	Carla	Now, at least, you can both have one.
34467	J.D.	I'm cool with keeping Stephen. We've gotten to know each other quite well.
34468	Turk	Well, how are we supposed to know who's who?
34469	J.D.	That's Stephen. Don't ask me how I know that.
34470	J.D.'s narration	As for Dr. Kelso, he knew that trusting us again was probably foolish.
34471	The Todd	Good night, sir.
34472	J.D.'s narration	Still, it was worth it.
34473	Maggie	You want half my sandwich?
34474	Dr. Kelso	Thank you, Mrs. Suarez.
34475	Maggie	It's Kent, Bob. Maggie...
34476	Dr. Kelso	Shhh!
34477	Maggie	Thank you.
